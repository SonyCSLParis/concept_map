coordinates 32.550354 ° n 35.356032 ° emongol invasions and conquests mamluk ilkhanid war the battle of ain jalut ayn jalut in arabic the spring of goliath or harod spring in hebrew took place on 3 september 1260 between muslim mamluks and the mongols in the southeastern galilee in the jezreel valley not far from the site of zir'in
the battle marked the south westernmost extent of mongol conquests and was the first time a mongol advance had been permanently halted
3 this was blamed on the sudden death of the then khagan möngke khan an event that forced the mongol ilkhanate hulagu khan to take a large part of his army back with him on the way to mongolia
this left hulagu 's lieutenant kitbuga with only a small detachment of soldiers
preceding events when möngke khan became great khan in 1251 he immediately set out to implement his grandfather genghis khan 's plan for world empire
to lead the task of subduing the nations of the west he selected his brother another of genghis khan 's grandsons hulagu khan
4]assembling the army took five years and it was not until 1256 that hulagu was prepared to begin the invasions
operating from the mongol base in persia hulagu proceeded south
mongke khan had ordered good treatment for those who yielded without resistance and destruction for those who did not
in this way hulagu and his army had conquered some of the most powerful and longstanding dynasties of the time
other countries in the mongols path submitted to mongol authority and contributed forces to the mongol army
by the time that the mongols reached baghdad their army included cilician armenians and even some frankish forces from the submissive principality of antioch
the hashshashin in persia fell the 500 year old abbasid caliphate of baghdad was destroyed see battle of baghdad and so too fell the ayyubid dynasty in damascus
hulagu 's plan was to then proceed southwards through the kingdom of jerusalem towards the mamluk sultanate to confront the major islamic power
4]during the mongol attack on the mamluks in the middle east most of the mamluks were made out of kipchaks and the golden horde 's supply of kipchaks replenished the mamluk armies and helped them fight off the mongols
5]mongol envoys to egypt in 1260 hulagu sent envoys to qutuz in cairo demanding his surrender from the king of kings of the east and west the great khan
to qutuz the mamluk who fled to escape our swords
you should think of what happened to other countries and submit to us
you have heard how we have conquered a vast empire and have purified the earth of the disorders that tainted it
we have conquered vast areas massacring all the people
you can not escape from the terror of our armies
where can you flee
what road will you use to escape us
our horses are swift our arrows sharp our swords like thunderbolts our hearts as hard as the mountains our soldiers as numerous as the sand
fortresses will not detain us nor armies stop us
your prayers to god will not avail against us
we are not moved by tears nor touched by lamentations
only those who beg our protection will be safe
hasten your reply before the fire of war is kindled
resist and you will suffer the most terrible catastrophes
we will shatter your mosques and reveal the weakness of your god and then will kill your children and your old men together
at present you are the only enemy against whom we have to march
6]qutuz responded however by killing the envoys and displaying their heads on bab zuweila one of the gates of cairo
4]the campaign the power dynamic then changed due to the death of the great khan mongke while on an expedition to china requiring hulagu and other senior mongols to return home to decide upon his successor
a potential great khan hulagu took the majority of his army with him and left a much smaller force west of the euphrates of only around one or two tumens 10,000–20,000 men the size of a modern military division under his best general the nestorian christian naiman kitbuqa noyan
7]upon receiving news of hulagu 's departure mamluk sultan qutuz quickly assembled a large army at cairo and invaded palestine
8 in late august kitbuqa 's forces proceeded south from their base at baalbek passing to the east of lake tiberias into lower galilee
the mamluk sultan qutuz at that time allied with a fellow mamluk baibars who chose to ally himself with qutuz in the face of a greater enemy after the mongols captured damascus and most of bilad al sham
3]the mongols for their part attempted to form a franco mongol alliance with or at least demand the submission of the remnant of the crusader kingdom of jerusalem now centered on acre but pope alexander iv had forbidden this
tensions between franks and mongols had also increased when julian of sidon caused an incident which resulted in the death of one of kitbuqa 's grandsons
angered kitbuqa sacked sidon
the barons of acre and the remainder of the crusader outposts contacted by the mongols had also been approached by the mamluks seeking military assistance against the mongols
3]though the mamluks were the traditional enemies of the franks the barons of acre recognized the mongols as the more immediate menace and so the crusaders opted for a position of cautious neutrality between the two forces
9 in an unusual move they agreed that the egyptian mamluks could march north through the crusader territories unmolested and even camp to resupply near acre
when news arrived that the mongols had crossed the jordan river sultan qutuz and his forces then proceeded southeast toward the spring at ain jalut in the jezreel valley

the mamluks had the advantage of knowledge of the terrain and qutuz capitalized on this by hiding the bulk of his force in the highlands hoping to bait the mongols with a smaller force under baibars
the two armies fought for many hours with baibars most of the time implementing hit and run tactics in order to provoke the mongol troops and at the same time preserve the bulk of his troops intact
when the mongols carried out another heavy assault baibars who it is said had laid out the overall strategy of the battle since he had spent much time in that region earlier in his life as a fugitive and his men feigned a final retreat drawing the mongols into the highlands to be ambushed by the rest of the mamluk forces concealed among the trees
the mongol leader kitbuqa already provoked by the constant fleeing of baibars and his troops committed a grave mistake instead of suspecting a trick kitbuqa decided to march forwards with all his troops on the trail of the fleeing mamluks
when the mongols reached the highlands mamluk forces emerged from hiding and began to fire arrows and attack with their cavalry
the mongols then found themselves surrounded on all sides
the mongol army fought very fiercely and very aggressively to break out
some distance away qutuz watched with his private legion
when qutuz saw the left wing of the mamluk army almost destroyed by the desperate mongols seeking an escape route qutuz threw away his combat helmet so that his warriors could recognize him
he was seen the next moment rushing fiercely towards the battlefield yelling wa islamah oh my islam urging his army to keep firm and advanced towards the weakened side followed by his own unit
the mongols were pushed back and fled to a vicinity of bisan followed by qutuz 's forces but they managed to reorganize and return to the battlefield making a successful counterattack
however the battle shifted in favor of the mamluks who now had both the geographic and psychological advantage and eventually some of the mongols were forced to retreat
when the battle ended the mamluk heavy cavalrymen had accomplished what had never been done before beating the mongols in close combat
10 kitbuqa and almost the whole mongol army that had remained in the region perished
the battle of ain jalut is also notable for being the earliest known battle where explosive hand cannons midfa in arabic were used
11 these explosives were employed by the mamluk egyptians in order to frighten the mongol horses and cavalry and cause disorder in their ranks
the explosive gunpowder compositions of these cannons were later described in arabic chemical and military manuals in the early 14th century
12][13]aftermathon the way back to cairo after the victory at ain jalut qutuz was assassinated by several emirs in a conspiracy led by baibars
14 baibars became the new sultan
his successors would go on to capture the last of the crusader states in the holy land by 1291
internecine conflict prevented hulagu khan from being able to bring his full power against the mamluks to avenge the pivotal defeat at ain jalut
berke khan the khan of the golden horde to the north of ilkhanate had converted to islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the abbasid caliph the spiritual head of islam
muslim historian rashid al din hamadani quoted berke as sending the following message to mongke khan protesting the attack on baghdad not knowing mongke had died in china he hulagu has sacked all the cities of the muslims and has brought about the death of the caliph
with the help of god i will call him to account for so much innocent blood
 15 the mamluks learning through spies that berke was both a muslim and not fond of his cousin were careful to nourish their ties to him and his khanate
after the mongol succession was finally settled with kublai as the last great khan hulagu returned to his lands by 1262 and massed his armies to attack the mamluks and avenge ain jalut
however berke khan initiated a series of raids in force which lured hulagu north away from the levant to meet him
hulagu suffered severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the caucasus in 1263
this was the first open war between mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire
hulagu was able to send only a small army of two tumens in his sole attempt to attack the mamluks after ain jalut and it was repulsed
hulagu khan died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son abaqa

part 4 and part 5)although medieval historians give conflicting accounts modern historians assign responsibility for qutuz 's assassination to baibars as baibars had been promised syria as a reward for his efforts in ain jalut but when it was time to claim his prize qutuz commanded him to be patient
see perry p. 150 amitai preiss p. 47 a conspiracy of amirs which included baybars and was probably under his leadership holt et al
