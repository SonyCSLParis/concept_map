during the seventh crusade led by louis ix of france saint louis in 1248 1250 the franks attempted to invalde egypt which would indeed provide a base from which to attack jerusalem
the crusader army consists of 15,000 men that included 3,000 knights and 5,000 crossbowmen

the crusaders must choose between alexandria and cairo as the next target
the ardent robert of artois another brother of the king will convince the crusaders to sail up the nile delta instead of attacking alexandria
indeed control of egypt has a significant strategic interest for the crusaders
robert of artois louis 's brother and the templars attack the egyptian camp at gideila near al mansurah

the serbian empire takes constantinople and stefan dušan is crowned emperor of the serbs and greeks
dieu le roi well known member always nice to see a crusades atl :d subbed dominusnovushumbled by fate interesting
i will dispute expelling all muslims that do not convert in egypt
ifind this unlikely to work or even be tried in such a populous country
more likely would be legal limitations on their rights higher taxes barred from official positions property limits etc
also just a tad too wanky for the crusaders
basically everything that could go right seems to be doing so if you count the christians as a whole at least

sympa le premier post
si tu aimes les uchronies médiévales tu devrais lire the lucky mariage de aegis03 florin
bon après tout se passe en effet trop bien pour les croisés
après tout les mongols ne sont encore que des barbares ilkhanides ou horde d'or
ils peuvent en préférer un et éviter la guerre mais cela ne veut pas dire qu'ils sont alliés
de toute façon il faudra prendre en compte tamerlan qui mettra fin à l'expérience croisée
jérôme said
the muslims are forced to convert to christanism or expelled from egypt
muslims made up over half the population of egypt at this time
since the vast majority wo n't convert in such a small time period this means egypt is depopulated by a lot
in a time when population and agriculture was the basis of a country 's wealth this effectively destroys the egyptian economy
mass expulsion of this size is unfeasible
if attempted it would probably lead to mass revolts which could very well overthrow the frankish invaders
neither the spanish nor the norman sicilians expelled the muslim population of the lands they conquered
instead there was an ongoing but small level of self deportation that occurred for centuries the removal of muslims from political life and a small level of naturally occurring conversion
when muslims were finally expelled from these lands it was centuries afterwards when christians made up the bulk of the population
when this happened in spain centuries after the end of the reconquista and even longer from the conquest of valencia it still greatly harmed the spanish economy
the vast majority of the muslim population will stay where it is
only the urban elite educated and fairly prosperous may choose to leave on their own
the frankish crusader will not want the muslim peasants working their fields to leave at all
should egypt remain in the christian camp it will take several centuries before christians dominate demographically
there could be an increasing number of legal restrictions against muslims over many decades and centuries to remove them from controlling important economic activities
this would make more and more elite muslims leave for better opportunities elsewhere
but initially the christians would need their expertise and involvement in order to milk egypt for its wealth
the restrictions will only be slowly introduced after the franks consolidate their control and then greedily see opportunities for expansion in certain areas if they can legally limit muslim dominance in that area
blackfox5well known memberjérôme said thanks to louis ix the orthodox copts are well treated
the edict of alexandia in 1255 grants the orthodox copts religious freedom
mixed marriages between orthodox copts and catholics are not uncommon
religious freedom is not a concept known in the middle ages
as part of pragmatic policy to consolidate their rule the frankish rulers of egypt might tolerate the independence and practices of the coptic church
there could be something like an edict of tolerance but most likely there wo n't be an official policy just a pragmatic administration
the copts are n't even chalcedonian christians like the eastern orthodox
there are major theological disputes with latin christianity
no frankish ruler can keep good graces with rome by giving full religious liberty to heretics
this does n't mean a modus vivendi ca n't be worked out especially in the short term
the latin crusaders were traditionally tolerate of the native non latin christians in the kingdom of jerusalem too
in the long term though the latin church will want the coptic church to change enough to be in communion with rome and this simply is n't going to happen
most likely some copts end up changing enough to have communion with rome like the maronites did
but i suspect the vast majority of copts wo n't
intermarriage could very well be common but likely only upon conversion of one of the members
or at the very least agreement that the children will be raised in only one of the christian faiths
among the nobles this is likely to be one way to catholicism
among the lower classes this could go either way
the latins will be welcoming to the coptic christians as allies to help cement their rule of egypt and they will be better treated than under muslims
many of the restrictions imposed upon dhimmis like the jizya tax will be removed
but the coptic church wo n't be seen as the equal of the catholic church
as frankish control over egypt solidifies and strengthens tolerance towards the copts will slowly erode as they are n't needed as much anymore
how bad it could get is debatable and could end up in many ways
fhaessigmembergiven the butterflies of the pod in particular the ones involving the templar if you are into conspiracy theory or artois if you are into more serious history the 100 year war will definitely not occur

i strongly agree
el twell known member seventh crusade my points 1 the venetians and genoese and possibly others will demand trading rights in egypt
2 a western conquest of egypt will possibly stiffen muslim resistance and lead to efforts to re conquer it
3 the latins already in syria palestine will desire lands in egypt as they are richer and more fertile than in syria

yes i think they would be two periods during the first century muslims are granted religious freedom but have to pay higher taxes
after 1350 they would be increasingly oppressed and subjected to more and more legal limitations of their rights like in sicily under the hohenstaufen rule

yes i have a few new ideas and a few questions
dracolazarus said bon après tout se passe en effet trop bien pour les croisés
après tout les mongols ne sont encore que des barbares ilkhanides ou horde d'or
ils peuvent en préférer un et éviter la guerre mais cela ne veut pas dire qu'ils sont alliés
the franks would have hard times struggling against the mamluks between 1251 and 1261
things would become easier after the mongol invasion provided that the franco mongol alliance really works
but i really think they could hold the nile delta
the crusaders stand united behind their king louis iv
the military leaders are louis iv 's brothers alphonse of poitiers charles of anjou and robert of artois
there is no divisions or rivalries among them
on the contrary after the first defeats the loss of several cities the death of 2 sultans and the war againsts the ayyubid the mamluk army would be disorganized and demoralized
the crusaders would take advantage of the conflict between the ayyubid and the mamluks which lasted until 1255 in otl
in otl they were several attempts at a franco mongol alliance against the islamic caliphates
in 1249 louis ix sent andré of longjumeau as emissary to the mongols
later he sent william of rubruck to karakorum
the ilkhanate was sympathetic to christianity
in otl the crusaders agreed to allow the egyptian mamluks to cross their territory to fight the mongols
in my tl they would not

yes i think that since the crusader recognize the strategic interest in controlling egypt they would carry out a pragmatic policy
el t said
my points 1 the venetians and genoese and possibly others will demand trading rights in egypt
yes but since the franks do not need venitian or genoese help to invalde and to hold egypt they would have no reason to grant them trading rights
el t said 2 a western conquest of egypt will possibly stiffen muslim resistance and lead to efforts to re conquer it
in my tl after 1261 syria is under mongol rule egypt is controlled by the franks the sultanate of rum starts to disintegrates like in otl
there is no muslim power able to confront both the ilkhanate and the franks
