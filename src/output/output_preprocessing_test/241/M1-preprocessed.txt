franco mongol alliance
this is very interesting i am curious what people think about this
many attempts were made towards forming a franco mongol alliance between the mid-13th and early 14th centuries starting around the time of the seventh crusade
1 historians note that in hindsight an alliance between the mongols and the franks european crusaders often appears a logical choice
1][2][3 the mongols were already very sympathetic to christianity as many mongols were nestorian christians
the europeans were open to the idea of assistance coming from the east due to the long running legend of a mythical prester john an eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would arrive someday to help with the fight in the holy land
the mongols and the franks also shared a common enemy in the muslims
there were numerous exchanges of letters gifts and emissaries between the mongols and the europeans as well as offers for varying types of cooperation
1 however despite many attempts there was never any long term successful military collaboration
modern historians also debate whether or not such an alliance if it had been successful would have been effective in shifting the balance of power in the region and/or whether it would have been a wise choice on the part of the europeans
4 traditionally the mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies with little room in the middle for something such as an ally
5]the closest thing to actual frankish cooperation with mongol military actions was the overlord subject relationship between the mongols and the frankish principality of antioch
6][10 other christian vassal states included georgia and cilician armenia
11 once these countries had submitted they were required to provide military forces to fight under the mongol banner and these forces often showed great enthusiasm in attacking muslim targets
12]the most successful points of both collaboration and non collaboration between the mongols and the christians were in 1260 when most of muslim syria was briefly conquered by the joint efforts of the mongols and the christians of armenia and antioch
13 however that same year there were other christians the franks of acre who entered into a passive truce with the other side the egyptian mamluks
this unusual neutrality on the part of the franks allowed the muslim egyptians to advance northwards through palestine to obtain a major and historic success against the mongols at 1260 's pivotal battle of ain jalut
the mongols again invaded syria several times between 1281 and 1312 sometimes in attempts at joint operations[14 with the europeans though there were considerable logistical difficulties involved which usually resulted in the forces arriving months apart and being unable to satisfactorily combine their activities
ultimately the attempts at alliance bore little fruit and ended with the victory of the egyptian mamluks the total eviction of both the franks and the mongols from palestine by 1303 and a treaty of peace between the mongols and the mamluks in 1323 the treaty of aleppo
