converting mongols to christianity be like x post r christianity mytilaccountfun fact the mongols welcomed christians to build churches in mongolia they also welcomed other religions
the khans tried for a hundred years to form an alliance with france so that they both can attack the muslim states
the mongols wanted french subjugation the french wanted conversion to christianity from the mongols
neither happened
they did end up fighting in a few battles together but no formal alliance
it all started when muslims in the steppes declared jihad on genghis
it also does n't help that genghis wife or daughter in law was a persian christian celletempcan't make an alliance
different religions means they ca n't royal marry
25thbaammcthat 's clearly why the court chaplains were sent to proselytise in their countiesproquo was it france
i know very little about the christian mongol alliance but i was always under the impression it was to be with the crusader states
france would be very far away to fight muslims with the mongols
champion santhe king 's angelshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-mongol_alliancekingofalbaalba several attempts at a franco mongol alliance against the islamic caliphates their common enemy were made by various leaders among the frankish crusaders and the mongol empire many western europeans were known as franks in that area regardless of whether they were frankish or from france
proquo i 'm also to understand the muslims referred to the crusader states as the franks with no concern for proper names or titles
kaiser41carolus martellus the crusaders returned the favor by called all muslims saracens regardless of whether they were arabs turks or anything else

we have attacked the enemy in al amarah further down the page it mentions that louis ix of france himself was in communication with the ilkhanate mongols in persia regarding a proposed joint invasion of the holy land
it fell through though
altrsaberall that shows is that louis ix would have been apart of the frankish alliance but that does n't mean he would be the only member
the article also mentions negotiations with the pope various crusader states the byzantine emperor the armenians the english the hungarians various italian republics etc
specialist290 we have attacked the enemy in al amarah
my only point is that for all that frankish was often generalized to european op was not incorrect to say that the french themselves were involved
kingofalbaalbanot technically incorrect but it 's not surprising that the major states in europe would establish relations with the mongols
i would n't say that thinking about maybe helping each other is an alliance in the true sense of the word

we have attacked the enemy in al amarah from the perspective of realpolitik is there any actual difference
deleted]the crusader states were overwhelmingly french though
and you have to remember that this is long before the concept of the nation state as we know it existed and there was a strong connection back to france
arguing the semantics of this is really pointless because it 's so nuanced that trying to understand it through modern concepts of statehood and ethnicity is n't going to work
tesshkmkhaaaaaaaaaaaaaanfrance had no problem fighting muslims in the crusades
proquobut that would have been very different
fighting the crusades at least for those that fought them would have an air of religious duty
you were supposed to fight them because you were a good catholic
other than that france would n't have been too concerned with the muslims except for maybe the ones in iberia
for the mongols an alliance with the crusader states would make more sense than with france
the crusaders were right there much closer than france
they had a shared enemy in the muslims
think about it in ckii terms would you ally with a kingdom off at the fringe of the map
tesshkmkhaaaaaaaaaaaaaanthe crusader states were mainly french
proquobut they were n't france
deleted]i see a lot of argument about this here
it 's really pointless
if you 're trying to frame this all through modern concepts of nationhood you 're only going to be wrong
proquo 1 punkt vor 12 monate
i 'm not at all trying to make this about nationhood
it 's my understanding that the crusader states had their own royal families and while they were very related to french houses and spoke french as a language they were not ruled by france or considered to be french vassals
they were independent enough from the kingdom of france that a mongol alliance with france would not have made the crusader states allies and vice versa
if i 'm incorrect about that go ahead and explain how i am i admittedly do n't know much about the crusader states but i do n't think i 'm incorrect in saying that they were n't france
mushroommountain123whatever happened to the muslims in the steppes
in the later game starts a lot of the areas east of russia are muslim
is that area still muslim lord_iggyfrisiathey are still there
tatars and bashkirs often practice sunni islam you can see them fairly easily in a religious map of russia
their religion and culture have been eroded somewhat by centuries of orthodox dominance but they are still there
so are the buddhist kalmyks
gamechowprydainwololo786888786888786here 's hulagu holding a cross with his wife epitath of a nestorian in monglia chinese nestorian steles from tang dynasty[deleted]there were plenty of steppe tribes individuals before and during the mongol empire which were christian incidentally- mostly nestorians as the church of the east was the only one which would evangelise so far out
islamic rulers had no problem with them preaching to non muslims which meant that places like the steppes were fertile ground for nestorian conversions
the keraits for example were supposedly if bar hebraeus is to be believed
christian from the 11th century at least among their ruling clans- as well as various important mongol nobles and wives such as kitbuqa sorghaghtani beki and doquz khatun
brrieck what am i going to do with all these dead incest babies
my first old gods to finish game was as the zoroastrian empire
i prepared for a century to get ready against the mongols as i had only barely defeated the seljuks
the first battle my shahanshah died then his son was the one who lost the empire and his son was the count of some insignificant castle in the ilkhanate
the mongols converted nestorian and that made them even more vicious
it was concerning at first especially when the grand coalition of independent persian zoroastrians rose up only the get massacred
i had spent time usurping the title of my own duke then getting an alliance of the last zoroastrian satraps who were getting forcibly removed as the mongols had essentially converted half the empire and started taking out the byzantines who had grown into the holy land since i only cared about keeping my own borders along with a couple of independent kingdoms in turkestan and arabia
eventually i lost and the mongols cut off my head
