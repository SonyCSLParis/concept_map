riveting
my slow descent into the bowels of costuming continues apace
for the longest time i would discreetly roll my eyes at people who had created elaborate personas ren faire types mostly who could recite the names of ten generations of fictional ancestors for the non existent people they were pretending to be for the day
some part of me felt towards these antics the way non costumers no doubt feel about those of us who dress up funny and lower the tone at geek events
we become what we hate pride cometh before a fall and many a mickle makes a muckle no scratch that last one
point is as alexandra wallace would probably say i have had an epiphany and although i failed to actually costume as planned for nova albion i have to my utter bewilderment and yes shame come up with a steamsona for myself
despite my scoffing i suddenly and unexpectedly discovered how and why this can be fun and more than that incredibly helpful to the costuming process
let me start from the beginning i was on the internet never a good start trolling for images of 19th eastern designs and fashions in hopes of finding inspiration for a nova albion costume since this year ’s theme was wild wild east
now i figured there would be plenty of chinese or japanese inspired outfits since they are probably the most familiar to people and also had the advantage for locals of both a large chinatown and japantown right here in san francisco to go hunting for fabric clothing and accessories in
in addition i dearly wanted to use the long white feather cloak i had made for gallifrey one so i also figured i would specifically focus on cultures with snowy climates since the look and feel of the cloak is very similar to a fur coat
one thing lead to another as it often will on the nets and i ended up reading about the 13th century franco mongol alliance attempts which i had never heard about and their connection to the legend of prester john which has always intrigued me
the alternate history timeline possibilities sprang pretty much full formed into my brain at that point and i could n’t stop thinking about it
regardless of whether i do ever complete my iberian ambassador to the court of prester john outfit or not the realization of how this backstory would inform the design choices not just for this one outfit but for any number of variations on it was a revelation
with a history to draw from the field narrows from a million possible choices to just the ones that fit within the logic of the persona you have created and the setting which you are exploring
now my character does n’t have a name i wo nt be cosplaying or putting on a funny accent my choices are strictly for the purposes of building a logical and interesting aesthetic
but nonetheless i now understand how one gets there from where i am and how that might be a fun place to be
