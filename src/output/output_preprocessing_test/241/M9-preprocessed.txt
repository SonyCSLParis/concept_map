hulagu khan hulagukhanhulagu with his kerait queen doquz khatun reign 1217 1265 died february 8 1265 buried lake urmia consort dokuz khatun father toluimother sorghaghtani beki hulagu khan also known as hulagu hülegü or hulegu mongolian khülegü chagatai persian hulaku arabic c. 1217 february 8 1265 was a mongol ruler who conquered much of southwest asia
son of tolui and the kerait princess sorghaghtani beki he was a grandson of genghis khan and the brother of arik boke mongke and kublai khan
hulagu 's army greatly expanded the southwestern portion of the mongol empire founding the ilkhanate of persia a precursor to the safavid dynasty and later to the modern state of iran
under hulagu 's leadership the mongols destroyed the greatest center of islamic power baghdad and also weakened damascus causing a shift of islamic influence to the mamluks in cairo
hulagu 's dynasty unified much of iran following several hundred years of political fragmentation
it also oversaw what has been described as an iranian renaissance
oscillatting between sunni and shi'a islam the latter would become the state religion after the beginning of the safavid dynasty
although the khanate disintegrated it brought stability to the region for about a century 1256 to 1353
it was in hulagu 's reign that iranian historians switched from writing in arabic to writing in persian
reviving pride in the cultural legacy of iran this may have contributed to the way in which iranian islam distinguished itself from the islam of the arab world and later from that of the ottoman empire
in 1264 after spending three years in hulagu 's realm marco polo and his uncle set off along the silk road to the court of the great khan
hulagu therefore contributed to bridge building between the european and eastern spaces
backgroundhulagu was born to tolui one of genghis khan 's sons and sorghaghtani beki an influential kerait princess
sorghaghtani successfully navigated mongol politics arranging for all of her sons to become mongol leaders
hulagu was friendly to christianity as his mother was a nestorian christian
hulagu 's favorite wife dokuz khatun was also a christian as was hulagu 's closest friend and general kitbuqa
hulagu told the armenian historian vardan arewelc'i in 1264 that he had been a christian since birth
it is recorded however that he resorted to buddhism as he neared his death against the will of his christian wife dokuz khatun jackson 2005 176
hulagu had at least three children abaqa second ilkhan of persia from 1265 1282 taraqai whose son baydu became ilkhan in 1295 and teguder ahmad third ilkhan from 1282 1284 morgan 1986 225
military campaigns hulagu 's brother mongke had been installed as great khan in 1251
in 1255 mongke charged his brother hulagu with leading a massive mongol army to conquer or destroy the remaining muslim states in southwestern asia
hulagu 's campaign sought the subjugation of the lurs a people of southern iran the destruction of the hashshashin sect the submission or destruction of the abbasid caliphate based in baghdad the submission or destruction of the ayyubid states in syria based in damascus and finally the submission or destruction of the bahri mamluk sultanate of egypt
mongke ordered hulagu to treat kindly those who submitted and utterly destroy those who did not
hulagu vigorously carried out the latter part of these instructions
hulagu marched out with perhaps the largest mongol army ever assembled by order of mongke two in ten fighting men in the entire empire were gathered for hulagu 's army
he easily destroyed the lurs and his reputation so frightened the assassins also known as the hashshashin that they surrendered their impregnable fortress of alamut to him without a fight
hulagu 's army attacks baghdad 1258
note siege engine in foreground
the mongol army led by hulagu khan and his top general guo kan set out for baghdad in november of 1257
hulagu demanded surrender the caliph refused warning the mongols that they faced the wrath of god if they attacked the caliph
hulagu 's forces then besieged the city which surrendered on february 10 1258 leading to a week long massacre by the mongols regarded as one of the most devastating events in the history of islam
a surviving member of the abbasid dynasty al mustansir fled to egypt where the mamluk sultan gave him refuge where his heirs continued to claim the title caliph until the ottoman conquest of 1517 although they did not exercise any political power
conquest of syria 1260)after baghdad in 1260 mongol forces combined with those of their christian vassals in the region such as the army of cilician armenia under hetoum i and the franks of bohemond vi of antioch
this force then conquered muslim syria domain of the ayyubid dynasty
they took together the city of aleppo and on march 1 1260 under the christian general kitbuqa they also took damascus
1](grousset 1981 581
on 1 march kitbuqa entered damascus at the head of a mongol army
with him were the king of armenia and the prince of antioch
the citizens of the ancient capital of the caliphate saw for the first time for six centuries three christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets runciman 1999 307
a christian mass was celebrated in the grand mosque of the umayyads the former cathedral of saint john the baptist richard 1996 423 and numerous mosques were profaned
many historical accounts describe the three christian rulers hetoum bohemond and kitbuqa entering the city of damascus together in triumph grousset 1981 588 though some modern historians such as david morgan have questioned this story as apocryphal morgan 1986 135
the invasion effectively destroyed the ayyubid dynasty theretofore powerful ruler of large parts of the levant egypt and arabia
the last ayyubid king an nasir yusuf was killed by hulagu in 1260 riley smith balard and cantoni 1996 108
with the islamic power center of baghdad gone and damascus weakened the center of islamic power transferred to the egyptian mamluks in cairo
hulagu 's intent at that point was to continue south through palestine towards cairo to engage the mamluks
however great khan mongke had died in late 1259 requiring hulagu to return karakorum to engage in the decision on who the next great khan would be
hulagu departed with the bulk of his forces leaving only about 10,000 mongol horsemen in syria under kitbuqa to occupy the conquered territory runciman 1999 310
kitbuqa 's forces engaged in raids southward towards egypt reaching as far as ascalon and jerusalem and a mongol garrison of about 1,000 was placed in gaza richard 1996 428 maalouf 1985 264 tyerman 2006 806 with another garrison located in naplouse maalouf 1985 262
battle of ayn jalut 1260)the mamluks took advantage of the weakened state of kitbuqa 's forces
the crusaders though traditional enemies of the mamluks also regarded the mongols as the greater threat
discussions took place between the muslims and the christians with debate about whether or not to join forces against the mongols but the muslims were not in agreement with this action
so instead the crusaders allowed the egyptian forces to come north through crusader territory and resupply near the crusaders powerbase of acre morgan 1986 137
the mamluks then engaged the remnants of the mongol army in galilee at the battle of ayn jalut
the mamluks achieved a decisive victory kitbuqa was executed and the location established a high water mark for the mongol conquest
in previous defeats the mongols had always returned later to re take the territory but they were never able to avenge the loss at ayn jalut
for the rest of the century the mongols would attempt other invasions of syria but never be able to hold territory for more than a few months
the border of the mongol ilkhanate remained at the tigris river for the duration of hulagu 's dynasty
later campaigns hulagu returned to his lands by 1262 after the succession was finally settled with his brother kublai khan established as great khan
but when hulagu massed his armies to attack the mamluks and avenge the defeat at ain jalut he was instead drawn into civil war with batu khan 's brother berke berke khan a muslim convert had promised retribution in his rage after hulagu 's sack of baghdad and allied himself with the mamluks
he initiated a series of raids on hulagu 's territories led by nogai khan
hulagu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the caucasus in 1263
this was the first open war between mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire
communications with europe hulagu sent multiple communications to europe in an attempt to establish a franco mongol alliance against the muslims
in 1262 he sent an embassy to all kings and princes overseas along with his secretary rychaldus
however the embassy was apparently intercepted in sicily by king manfred who was allied with the mamluks and in conflict with pope urban iv and rychaldus was returned by ship jackson 2005 173
on april 10 1262 hulagu sent through john the hungarian a letter to the french king louis ix offering an alliance jackson 2005 178
it is unclear whether the letter ever reached louis ix in paris as the only known manuscript survived in vienna austria jackson 2005 166
however the letter stated hulagu 's intention to capture jerusalem for the benefit of the pope and asked for louis to send a fleet against egypt:"from the head of the mongol army avid to devastate the perfid nation of the sarasins goodwilling support of the christian faith so that you who are the rulers of the coasts on the other side of the sea endeavour to deny a refuge for the infidels your enemies and ours by having your subjects diligently patrol the seas
 |letter from hulagu to saint louis
2]despite many attempts neither hulagu nor his successors were ever able to form an alliance with europe
however the thirteenth century did see a vogue of mongol things in the west
many new born children in italy were named after mongol rulers including hulagu names such as can grande great khan alaone hulagu argone arghun or cassano ghazan are recorded jackson 2005 315
the polos nicolò and maffeo in bukhara where they stayed for three years
they were invited by a envoy of hulagu right to travel east to visit the great khan kubilai
niccolò and maffeo polo reportedly traveled to the realm of hulagu and stayed in the city of bukhara in modern day uzbekistan where the family lived and traded for three years from 1261 to 1264
nicolò and maffeo then joined up with an embassy sent by hulagu to his brother the great khan kublai
in 1266 the polos reached the seat of the great khan in the mongol capital khanbaliq present day beijing china
they reportedly remained there many years until in 1291 sent on a mission by kublai to escort a 17 year old princess bride kököchin to arghun khan hulagu 's grandson
deathhulagu khan died in 1265 and was buried in the kaboudi island in lake urmia
his funeral was the only ilkhanid funeral to feature human sacrifice morgan 1986 139
he was succeeded by his son abaqa thus establishing his line
legacyhulagu khan laid the foundations of the ilkhanate state and by doing so paved the way for the later safavid dynastic state and ultimately the modern country of iran
hulagu 's conquests also opened iran to both europe influence from the west and chinese influence from the east
this combined with patronage from his successors would develop iran 's distinctive excellence in architecture
the polos set out along the silk road during his rule their journey substantially contributed to east west cultural exchange
the dynasty unified much of iran following several hundred years of political fragmentation
adopting islam they oversaw what has been described as a renaissance in iran
oscillatting between sunni and shi'a islam the latter would become the state religion after the beginning of the safavid dynasty
although the khanate disintegrated it brought stability to the region for about a century
their rule is usually dated from 1256 to 1353
under hulagu 's dynasty iranian historians also moved from writing in arabic to writing in persian robinson 2007 19 36
this revival of pride in iran 's ancient cultural legacy may have contributed to the later development of twelver shi'a islam as a distinctive iranian expression of islam in contrast to the sunni islam that dominated the arab and ottoman spaces
