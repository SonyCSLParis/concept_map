historyhellenistic era the first major step in opening the silk road between the east and the west came with the expansion of alexander the great 's empire into central asia
in august 329 bce at the mouth of the fergana valley in tajikistan he founded the city of alexandria eschate or alexandria the furthest
this later became a major staging point on the northern silk route
in 323 bce alexander the great ’s successors the ptolemaic dynasty took control of egypt
they actively promoted trade with mesopotamia india and east africa through their red sea ports and over land
this was assisted by a number of intermediaries especially the nabataeans and other arabs
the greeks remained in central asia for the next three centuries first through the administration of the seleucid empire and then with the establishment of the greco bactrian kingdom in bactria
they continued to expand eastward especially during the reign of euthydemus 230–200 bce who extended his control beyond alexandria eschate to sogdiana
there are indications that he may have led expeditions as far as kashgar in chinese turkestan leading to the first known contacts between china and the west around 200 bce
the greek historian strabo writes they extended their empire even as far as the seres china and the phryni
 chinese exploration of central asia with the mediterranean linked to the fergana valley the next step was to open a route across the tarim basin and the gansu corridor to china proper
this came around 130 bce with the embassies of the han dynasty to central asia following the reports of the ambassador zhang qian who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the yuezhi against the xiongnu
after the defeat of the xiongnu however chinese armies established themselves in central asia starting the famed silk road which became a major avenue of international trade
some say that the chinese emperor wu di became interested in developing commercial relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of ferghana bactria and parthian empire the son of heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus ferghana dayuan and the possessions of bactria ta hsia and parthian empire anxi are large countries full of rare things with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the chinese people but with weak armies and placing great value on the rich produce of china hou hanshu later han history
others say that wu di was mainly interested in fighting the xiougnu and that major trade began only after the chinese pacified the gansu corridor

the chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies around ten every year to these countries and as far as seleucid syria
thus more embassies were dispatched to anxi parthia yancai who later joined the alans lijian
syria under the seleucids tiaozhi
chaldea and tianzhu northwestern india as a rule rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year and at the least five or six hou hanshu later han history
the roman historian florus also describes the visit of numerous envoys included seres to the first roman emperor augustus who reigned between 27 bce and 14
the silk road came into being from the 1st century bce following these efforts by the yuezhi and xiongnu in the tarim basin to consolidate a road to the western world and india both through direct settlements in the area of the tarim basin and diplomatic relations with the countries of the dayuan parthians and bactrians further west

maritime silk route opened up between chinese controlled giao ch centred in modern vietnam
see map above near hanoi probably by the 1st century
it extended via ports on the coasts of india and sri lanka all the way to roman controlled ports in egypt and the nabataean territories on the northeastern coast of the red sea roman empire soon after the roman conquest of egypt in 30 bce regular communications and trade between india southeast asia sri lanka china the middle east africa and europe blossomed on an unprecedented scale
the greco roman trade with india started by eudoxus of cyzicus in 130 bce kept on increasing and according to strabo ii.5.12 by the time of augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from myos hormos in roman egypt to india
the party of maës titianus became the travelers who penetrated farthest east along the silk road from the mediterranean world probably with the aim of regularizing contacts and reducing the role of middlemen during one of the lulls in rome 's intermittent wars with parthia which repeatedly obstructed movement along the silk road
land and maritime routes were closely linked and novel products technologies and ideas began to spread across the continents of europe asia and africa
intercontinental trade and communication became regular organized and protected by the great powers

intense trade with the roman empire soon followed confirmed by the roman craze for chinese silk supplied through the parthians even though the romans thought silk was obtained from trees
this belief was affirmed by seneca the younger in his phaedra and by virgil in his georgics
notably pliny the elder knew better
speaking of the bombyx or silk moth he wrote in his natural histories they weave webs like spiders that become a luxurious clothing material for women called silk
 the roman senate issued in vain several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk on economic and moral grounds the importation of chinese silk caused a huge outflow of gold and silk clothes were considered to be decadent and immoral:"i can see clothes of silk if materials that do not hide the body nor even one 's decency can be called clothes wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife 's body seneca the younger c.3 bce–65 declamations vol i
after losing at the battle of carrhae in 53 bc 10,000 roman prisoners were sent by the parthians to margiana to help guard the eastern frontier of the parthian empire
it is possible that contingents of these men found their way into china
byzantine historian procopius stated that two christian monks eventually uncovered the way of how silk was made
from this revelation spies were sent to steal the silkworm eggs resulting in silk production in the mediterranean

the heyday of the silk road corresponds on its west end to the byzantine empire sassanid empire period to il khanate period in the nile oxus section and three kingdoms to yuan dynasty in the sinitic zone in its east end
trade between east and west also developed on the sea between alexandria in egypt and guangzhou in china fostering across the indian ocean
the silk road represents an early phenomenon of political and cultural integration due to inter regional trade
in its heyday the silk road sustained an international culture that strung together groups as diverse as the magyars armenians and chinese
under its strong integrating dynamics on the one hand and the impacts of change it transmitted on the other tribal societies previously living in isolation along the silk road or pastoralists who were of barbarian cultural development were drawn to the riches and opportunities of the civilizations connected by the silk road taking on the trades of marauders or mercenaries
many barbarian tribes became skilled warriors able to conquer rich cities and fertile lands and forge strong military empires
a.v. dybo noted that according to historians the main driving force of the great silk road were not just sogdians but the carriers of a mixed sogdian türkic culture that often came from mixed families
the sogdians dominated the east west trade after the 4th century ce up to the 8th century ce with suyab and talas ranking among their main centers in the north
they were the main caravan merchants of central asia
their commercial interests were protected by the resurgent military power of the göktürks whose empire has been described as the joint enterprise of the ashina clan and the soghdians
their trades with some interruptions continued in the 9th century within the framework of the uighur empire which until 840 extended across northern central asia and obtained from china enormous deliveries of silk in exchange for horses
at this time caravans of sogdians traveling to upper mongolia are mentioned in chinese sources
they played an equally important religious and cultural role
part of the data about eastern asia provided by muslim geographers of the 10th century actually goes back to sogdian data of the period 750–840 and thus shows the survival of links between east and west
however after the end of the uighur empire sogdian trade went through a crisis
what mainly issued from muslim central asia was the trade of the samanids which resumed the northwestern road leading to the khazars and the urals and the northeastern one toward the nearby turkic tribes
the silk road gave rise to the clusters of military states of nomadic origins in north china invited the nestorian manichaean buddhist and later islamic religions into central asia and china created the influential khazar federation and at the end of its glory brought about the largest continental empire ever the mongol empire with its political centers strung along the silk road beijing in north china karakorum in central mongolia sarmakhand in transoxiana tabriz in northern iran sarai and astrakhan in lower volga solkhat in crimea kazan in central russia erzurum in eastern anatolia realizing the political unification of zones previously loosely and intermittently connected by material and cultural goods
in central asia islam expanded from the 7th century onward bringing a stop to chinese westward expansion at the battle of talas in 751 further expansion of the islamic turks in central asia from the 10th century finished disrupting trade in that part of the world and buddhism almost disappeared
for much of the middle ages the islamic caliphate centred in the near east often had a monopoly over much of the trade conducted across the old world see muslim age of discovery for more details

the gray area is the later timurid empire
the mongol expansion throughout the asian continent from around 1207 to 1360 helped bring political stability and re establish the silk road via karakorum
it also brought an end to the islamic caliphate 's monopoly over world trade
since the mongol had dominated the trade routes it allowed more trade to come in and out of the region
merchandise that did not seem valuable to the mongols was often seen as very valuable by the west
as a result the mongol received in return a large amount of luxurious goods from the west
however they never abandoned their nomadic lifestyle
soon after genghis khan died the silk road was in the hand of genghis khans daughters
the mongol diplomat rabban bar sauma visited the courts of europe in 1287–1288 and provided a detailed written report back to the mongols
around the same time the venetian explorer marco polo became one of the first europeans to travel the silk road to china and his tales documented in the travels of marco polo opened western eyes to some of the customs of the far east
he was not the first to bring back stories but he was one of the widest read
he had been preceded by numerous christian missionaries to the east such as william of rubruck benedykt polak giovanni da pian del carpine and andrew of longjumeau
later envoys included odoric of pordenone giovanni de marignolli john of montecorvino niccolò de conti or ibn battuta a moroccan muslim traveller who passed through the present day middle east and across the silk road from tabriz between 1325–1354
the 13th century also saw attempts at a franco mongol alliance with exchange of ambassadors and failed attempts at military collaboration in the holy land during the later crusades though eventually the mongols in the ilkhanate after they had destroyed the abbasid and ayyubid dynasties eventually themselves converted to islam and signed the 1323 treaty of aleppo with the surviving muslim power the egyptian mamluks
the silk road stopped serving as a shipping route for silk around 1400
the disappearance of the silk road following the end of the mongols reign was one of the main factors that stimulated the europeans to reach the prosperous chinese empire through another route especially by sea
tremendous profits were to be obtained for anyone who could achieve a direct trade connection with asia
this was the main driving factor for the portuguese explorations of the indian ocean including the sea of china resulting in the arrival in 1513 of the first european trading ship to the coasts of china under jorge álvares and rafael perestrello followed by the fernão pires de andrade and tomé pires diplomatic and commercial mission of 1517 under the orders of manuel i of portugal which opened formally relations between the portuguese empire and the ming dynasty during the reign of the zhengde emperor
the handover of macau macao to portugal in 1557 by the emperor of china as a reward for services rendered against the pirates who infested the south china sea resulted in the first permanent european maritime trade post between europe and china with other european powers following suit over the next centuries which caused the eventual demise of the silk road landroute
in 1594 willem barents left amsterdam with two ships to search for the northeast passage north of siberia on to eastern asia
he reached the west coast of novaya zemlya and followed it northward being finally forced to turn back when confronted with its northern extremity
by the end of the 17th century the russians re established a land trade route between europe and china under the name of the great siberian road
the desire to trade directly with china and india was also the main driving force behind the expansion of the portuguese beyond africa after 1480 followed by the netherlands and england from the 17th century
while the portuguese and subsequently other europeans were entering china from its southern coast by the sea route the question arose as to whether it happens to be the same country as cathay which marco had reached by the overland route
by c. 1600 the jesuits stationed in china led by matteo ricci were pretty sure that it was but others were not convinced yet
to check the situation on the ground bento de góis a portuguese former soldier and explorer who had joined the jesuits as a lay brother in goa india traveled in 1603–1605 from india via afghanistan and one of the routes of the traditional silk road via badakhshan the pamirs yarkand kucha and turpan to the ming china 's border as suzhou gansu
during the fifth and sixth centuries b.c.e. merchants played a large role in the spread of religion in particular buddhism
merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of buddhism to be an appealing alternative to previous religions
as a result merchants supported buddhist monasteries along the silk roads and in return the buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city
as a result merchants spread buddhism to foreign encounters as they travelled
36 merchants also helped to establish diaspora within the communities they encountered and overtime their cultures became based on buddhism
because of this these communities became centers of literacy and culture with well organized marketplaces lodging and storage
the silk road transmission of buddhism essentially ended around the 7th century with the rise of islam in central asia
