why did n't the franco mongol alliance formalize in the 13th century
after reading a little about rabban bar sauma a christian who made a pilgrimage from china to jerusalum and later became the mongolian ambassador to europe my question is why did n't the alliance form
they seemed to have similar goals taking out the mamluks muslims
