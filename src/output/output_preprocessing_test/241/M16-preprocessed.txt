ilkhanid mongol historical overview section the ilkhanate was one of the four khanates within the mongol empire
it was centered in persia based originally on genghis khan 's campaigns in the khwarezmid empire in 1219 1224 and the continual expansion of mongol presence under the commands of chormagan baiju and eljigidei
the founder of the ilkhanate dynasty was hulegu khan grandson of genghis khan and brother of mongke khan
taking over from baiju in 1255 or 1256 he had been charged with subduing the muslim kingdoms to the west as far as the borders of egypt
 this occupation led the turkmens to move west into anatolia to escape from the mongolian tribes
hulegu then returned to the persian heartland and established his dynasty
his expedition towards egypt however was halted in palestine in 1260 by a major defeat at the battle of ain jalut at the hands of the mamluk egyptians
hulagu 's descendants ruled persia for the next eighty years beginning as shamanists then buddhists and ultimately converting to islam
however the ilkhans remained opposed to the mamluk egyptians who had defeated both mongol invaders and both early crusaders and the later crusaders
many attempts were made towards forming a franco mongol alliance between the mid-13th and early 14th centuries starting around the time of the seventh crusade
the later crusaders were open to the idea of assistance coming from the east due to the long running legend of a mythical prester john an eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would arrive someday to help with the fight in the holy land
the mongols and the franks also shared a common enemy in the mamluk egyptian muslims
the closest thing to actual later crusader cooperation with mongol military actions was the overlord subject relationship between the mongols and the later crusader principality of antioch and other christian vassal states such as the included georgians and cilician armenians
once these countries had submitted they were required to provide military forces to fight under the ilkhanid banner and these forces often showed great enthusiasm in attacking mamluk egyptian moslem targets
in 1260 most of the syrian states were briefly conquered by the joint efforts of the mongols and the cilician armenians and later crusaders of antioch
however in the same year another later crusader state entered into a passive truce with the mamluk egyptians and stood aside as the egyptian forces advanced northwards through palestine allowing them to secure a major and historic success against the mongols at 1260 's pivotal battle of ain jalut
the mongols again invaded syria several times between 1281 and 1312 and sometimes attempted joint operations with the europeans but ultimately both the later crusader franks and the mongols were ejected from palestine by 1303 leading to the 1323 mongol mamluk egyptian treaty of aleppo which saw the mongol stranglehold over their vassals the sultanate of rum and the cilician armenian kingdoms end
this was hastened by the hostility of the khanates to the north and east the chagatai khanate in moghulistan and the tatar olden horde of berke threatened the ilkhanate in the caucasus and transoxiana preventing expansion westward
even under hülagü 's reign the ilkhanate was engaged in open warfare in the caucasus with the tatar mongols on the russian steppes
after abu sa'id 's death in 1335 the khanate began to disintegrate rapidly and split up into several rival successor states most prominently the jalayirids
timur leader of timurid part of the timurid white sheep turcoman or black sheep turcomans later carved a state from the jalayirids ostensibly to restore the old khanate
who are these mongols anyway then

using the army in fogyou may want to review the troop types in fog shooty cavalry page of the fog tactical guide methinks like other shooty cavalry armies your battle plan is usually to stake out as much ground as possible to block enemy second moves at least in some sectors and leave ample manoeuvre room behind your lines
getting first move is very helpful so losing the pbi roll is preferred by some players although your tough cv may be willing to face the enemy in close combat so its therefore less critical to keep lots of manoeuvre room to the rear
you also ca n't choose steppe terrain so that helps to decide to not take an ic and lose the initiative roll
agricultural is not too bad for any mongols as you can use open fields instead of opens
in open fields your lh still move fast but your cavalry are on evens against lancers
without an ic consider taking all the lh as superior so you can enter into a shooting match with confidence only three generals is probably ok since this will be a small army in bg numbers
also you should not plan to fight with any troops until you are at a big advantage so less need for generals to tip he balance in evens combats
the knights are tempting but sort of defeat the object of the rest of the army
if you do have them keep them as a reserve rather than leading with them
against knight armies you will be outnumbered by enemy knights
anyway
so
textbook stuff is to deploy the cavalry on the flanks to bully other lights and your own lights in the middle to decline combat
sometimes you are lucky and the enemy deploys with a hanging flank you can readily outwing and envelop or a good flank march opportunity presents itself but often the terrain and enemy dispositions limit you to a frontal approach of disrupting loosening and disjointing the enemy line of battle with shooting threats and uncontrolled enemy charges in order to expose gaps flanks and other weak spots you then exploit with concentrated shooting or timely charges destroy or flee enemy skirmishers draw their mounted and aggressive foot away from their other troops by skirmishing he will have to charge shooters to reduce their effect pick off isolated detachments and provoke charges where possible
work around his flank and hunt his bg count filler such as mobs and lf
ultimately your cavalry will need to be the ones to win the battle for you by running down your opponents remember this and don;t expect your lh to do all the work in eroding enemy morale and competence to breaking point
one common mistake with all shooty cavalry is to take advantage of the possibility evade too often superior armoured cavalry swordsmen are still very potent combat troops against most enemies and it is often better to advance in 2 ranks inflicting more shooting as a result and take on any enemies in hand to hand combat
the time to commit is once an enemy has gone disrupted or if they have lost bases waiting and skirmishing in the hope they go fragmented may well be gilding the lilly
the crusader knights are cool and have great staying power but are slow and might distract you from the main reason to use the army
see them as an anvil to occupy the enemy whilst you work the flanks not as a hammer to win the game alone
superior un)protected drilled cavalry are not too bad when combined with other lh on a flank they will outmatch standard lh who might otherwise risk standing up to your expensive superior lh and may catch them when they evade
they are just as good as armoured cavalry against heavily armoured knights as well
the unique option with this list is cavalry and light horse adding one or more superior heavily armoured knight units
the ilkanids get a handy unit of proper knights plus they can take a knight plus filler armenian ally
you could even take a mongol cavalry unit as unprotected superior as rear support
this gets you around one of the problems with the cv lh only outfits people can press you back with a well constructed line of medium weight troops enough generals and rear support to shrug off shooting enough strength to make a cavalry charge a big risk
the proper knights will batter through a medium weight line in the blink of an eye
so your opponent now has a difficulty close up to face the knights and get your flanks killed or spread out and risk a frontal break through
arguably the bg of knights slows you up and uses lots of points when what you want is more shooting and more superior shooting
the other downer with this army is no steppes as playing the mongols with tactics of move and shoot is the way to get around the back of the enemy which you can do more easily on the steppes
the ilkhanids can get both kurdish lancers and hospitallers making them one of the most powerful mongol options
the drilled hospitallers can get to the weak point in the enemy line and smash through all the while your opponent is worried about getting pincushioned to death
by using several lh bgs you run those up the middle and slow down the enemy 's hopefully less maneuverable units
with the flanks unprotected you should overload a flank with your cavalry and light horse
try to swing your lh around the flanks and rear of a single anchor
i 've seen my buddies drop no less than 9 10 dice onto a single bg for most bgs you are hitting on 4s and should get 4 5 hits easily especially with your re rolls
that means every time you can pull that off your opponent will have to test with a -1 or -2 and take a deathroll
no you do n't win quickly but it is hard to lose too
one of my frequent opponents complained that an army like the mongol conquest have too many superior and not enough dice
you end up taking too long and running out of time to win
to offset that he prefers to use the lh to disrupt an opponent and then charges in with a slightly less expensive superior armoured lancer cavalry
you end up busting through that anchor more quickly and can then rapidly take advantage of the failed battleline
this of course means that you have to find a different steppe army perhaps the huns
