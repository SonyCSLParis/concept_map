long read the cottingley fairies a weird british story of myth and hype with a connection to sir arthur conan doyle july 22 2014 by derek 2 comments my dad and i are fans of sherlock holmes
we both eagerly await series 4 of sherlock and my dad once embedded the following words from arthur conan doyle in all his emails whenever you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
this column is not so much about him as how arthur conan doyle managed to completely disregard his own advice and start believing in fairies
how it came to pass by all accounts it all started as harmless fun
in the summer of 1917 9 year old frances griffith and her mother left their home in south africa to go to the home of her 16 year old cousin elsie wright and her mother in the west riding of yorkshire
despite the age difference the two got along swimmingly even spending their days playing near the stream
when their mothers noticed how wet their clothes got they made the excuse that they were only out there playing with fairies
arthur wright elsie ’s father was an amateur photographer back in the days before anyone with a cell phone could take a photo of anything on the fly or indeed before anyone with access to a supermarket could drop their film off and get fully developed photos in about an hour
so to prove their claims they convinced him to lend them his camera so they could show it
30 minutes later they came back with the first in what would become a series of 5 photos
however he dismissed them as cardboard cutouts
remember this this will be important later
two months later they decided to give it another try and came up with another photograph
this time dad was convinced the girls had tampered with his camera and refused to allow them to use it again
mom however was convinced
two years after the photos were taken mom attended a meeting of bradford ’s theosophical society on fairies and showed the two photographs to the speaker near the end of the meeting
later they would be shown at a meeting of the theosophical society and edward gardner a leading member said of the photographs that the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies which others had done but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway
for the record the theosophical society really assumed evolution worked that way
then they sent the photographs and the original glass plates to an expert who insisted that the two negatives are entirely genuine unfaked photographs
with no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models and that these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time eventually in 1920 arthur conan doyle found out about these photographs
enter arthur conan doyle
this is going to need some explanation why did the man who wrote whenever you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth fall for this simply put a few years before he went through the wringer
in 1918 his son kingsley died of pneumonia while recovering from injuries incurred two years earlier in the battle of the somme
the next year his brother innes died of pneumonia
like many he found succor in the belief in life after death and found himself getting more and more involved in spiritualist movements
as anyone who ’s read joan didion knows such a loss can easily affect one ’s thought processes and in arthur conan doyle it reached the point that he was convinced that his good friend harry houdini who went through similar experiences and ended up having the exact opposite reaction to the supernatural really had supernatural powers despite both his demonstrations and remonstrations to the contrary
one is reminded of the scene from blackadder the third where edmund complains that the prince regent loves the theatre but does n’t seem to understand it ’s not real
so if he was able to convince himself that a magician who spent the later part of his life debunking the supernatural was himself supernatural it ’s not too hard to see why he was convinced the photos were real
he was working on an article on fairies for a christmas edition of the strand and asked the wrights for permission to use the photographs
needless to say arthur wright was so impressed that the man who created sherlock holmes was asking him for the rights that he let him print them free of charge
doyle found another expert at kodak to examine the photographs and while hesitant to admit they were evidence of fairies insisted there was no doctoring of the photographs
another company said there was some evidence of faking and a scientist examined the photos and insisted that the fairies were dancers with distinctly parisienne hairstyles
but doyle was convinced
three more photos
in summer 1920 doyle was on a lecture tour of australia so he could n’t just go to the other side of the world
but edward gardner decided to go to the wright house
arthur told gardner that when the two were away he searched both their rooms and the beck where the photos were taken and found no evidence of fraud
he convinced frances who had moved to scarborough to return so they could take new photographs of the local fairies
in his words i went off to cottingley again taking the two cameras and plates from london and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras giving one each to keep
the cameras were loaded and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and tice the fairies as they called their way of attracting them and see what they could get
i suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance for i knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility
if nothing came of it all i told them they were not to mind a bit
it was n’t until august 19 that they decided the weather was right for photography
frances and elsie told everyone that the fairies would reveal themselves to them alone
they each took one photograph while mother went to her sister ’s for tea
two days later they took a photo apparently of fairies in their nest and that was the end of it
they sent the photos to doyle who promptly worked them into a book called the coming of the fairies
the publication doyle published the original 1917 photos in an article in the strand writing a sympathetic account of frances and elsie ’s encounters calling them alice and iris carpenter to protect their identities ending with the words the recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud and will make it admit that there is a glamour and mystery to life
having discovered this the world will not find it so difficult to accept that spiritual message supported by physical facts which has already been put before it
reactions ranged from major john hall edwards photographer and early advocate of x rays on the evidence i have no hesitation in saying that these photographs could have been faked
i criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because as a medical man i believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the minds of children will result in later life in manifestations and nervous disorder and mental disturbances to novelist henry de vere stacpoole saying look at alice ’s
frances face
look at iris ’s
elsie ’s face
there is an extraordinary thing called truth which has 10 million faces and forms it is god ’s currency and the cleverest coiner or forger ca n’t imitate it
unfortunately by the time doyle ’s book came out interest had largely subsided
the resurrection of the fairies the next summer gardner had one more visit with frances and elsie this time bringing noted clairvoyant geoffrey hodson
they came to hunt for fairies but frances and elsie claimed they did n’t see any
but hodson saw fairies everywhere
in a film about the fairies this would probably be a perfect ending
the two girls having put aside childish things like fairies decide to stop playing the game but the adults in their second childhood are convinced that they ’re everywhere
but the story did n’t end there
45 years later a reporter for the daily express tracked down elsie who claimed this time that the fairies were figments of her imagination but suggested that she was somehow able to photograph the contents of her mind sparking a new interest in the photographs
in 1976 they were both on yorkshire television where they simultaneously claimed that a rational person does n’t see fairies and that the photos were genuine
more analysis of the photos was done and it leaned more heavily towards fake than they did earlier
indeed skeptic extraordinaire james randi noticed he could even see strings on the fairies
but this does n’t end there
how it happened in 1983 the cousins finally admitted that the photographs were a hoax
they still insisted they really saw fairies but they explained that the fairies in the photographs were all traced from illustrations of fairies from princess mary ’s gift book a children ’s anthology popular at the time
they cut them out painted them supported them with hatpins and threw them in the beck when they were done
however the fifth photograph remained controversial elsie admitted it was a fake but frances maintained that it was genuine
elsie said in a 1985 interview with yorkshire television two village kids and a brilliant man like conan doyle well we could only keep quiet
i never even thought of it as being a fraud it was just elsie and i having a bit of fun and i ca n’t understand to this day why they were taken in they wanted to be taken in
they both died in the 1980s
the afterlife of the fairies
by 1988 both cousins were dead
the photographs two of the cameras used to make them elsie ’s watercolours of the fairies and a 9 page letter of elsie admitting to the hoax are currently on display at the national media museum in bradford
christine lynch frances daughter had one of frances cameras and her copies of the photographs appraised and got a price of £ 25,000 and £ 30,000
a few months later frances memoirs reflections on the cottingley fairies were published containing increasingly bitter correspondence between frances and elsie from 1917 to 1983
in 1994 brian froud and terry jones wrote a book called lady cottington ’s pressed fairy book parodying the phoenomenon and in 1997 two films were made about the hoax fairy tale a true story and photographing fairies
both are very loosely based on the real events the former taking frances and elsie at their word that the photographs may have been fake but the fairies themselves were real and the latter changing everyone ’s names and getting so dark that it ends with a murder
it ’s difficult to tell which takes greater liberties with the original story
the moral of the story:“whenever you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth but try to examine what exactly you mean by impossible whenever possible
