arthur conan doyle spiritualism and fairies by donald e. simanek note many images on this pages are large high resolution files and slow to load
please be patient until they appear
while many of arthur conan doyle 's books are available as e text on the internet and many web sites are devoted to him and his work there 's scant mention of doyle 's credulous acceptance of spiritualism fairies and other occult ideas
this is a small effort to remedy that omission
modern spiritualism began in the united states in the mid 19th century
specifically it arose in western new york state a region known to social historians for the religious fervor which made it a spawning ground for many religious sects
they refer to it as the infected district or the burned over district
 spiritualism was born in the fertile religious fervor of immigrant swedenborgians mesmerists and other religions a climate of thought receptive to spiritualist ideas
mainstream religions promised eternal life but in an era of emerging science which demanded verifiable physical evidence many religious persons wished for tangible evidence of the claims of relgion particularly of claims of an afterlife
such apparent evidence appeared in hydesville new york in 1848 in a modest frame house which had a reputation of being haunted
here occured the event which launched the movement known as modern spiritualism to distinguish it from earlier historical beliefs about an afterlife
the fox family had three teenage daughters who claimed to hear strange rapping noises at night
the girls thought a ghost might be producing the noises so they tried to respond by clapping their hands
they soon evolved a code for communicating with the ghost of a peddler who had long ago visited the house and had been murdered there
a skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this
naturally this attracted much local attention
the fox girls were instant celebrities
they demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks automatic writing and later even voice communication as the spirit took control of one of the girls
soon others now known as mediums imitated this and began communicating with the dead charging for their services or accepting donations
seances were conducted in dark or semi dark rooms with participants seated around a table
sometimes the table would lean and tilt participants sitters might feel a cold breeze on their faces fresh flowers even out of season sometimes materialized out of thin air and appeared upon the table
musical instruments played mysteriously
the medium sometimes spoke under control of a spirit relaying meassages from the dear departed
other methods of spirit communication included writing on sealed slates impressing images onto photographic plates which had been kept in sealed enclosures and painted images which gradually appeared upon previously blank canvas
skeptics suspected this was nothing but clever deception and fraud
nonetheless belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly becoming an organized religion called spiritualism
spiritualism flourished well into the 20th century and still exists today
suspicions that the seance room phenomena were fraudulent were reinforced when margaret fox confessed to deception
on october 21 1888 margaret appeared before an audience of 2000 to demonstrate how she had fraudulently produced the spirit raps
in her stocking feet on a small pine platform six inches above the floor margaret produced raps audible throughout the theater by cracking her toe joints
doctors from the audience came on stage to verify the source of the sound
margaret confessed that she and her sister used this and other methods to produce the raps
sometimes they used an apple on a string bouncing it on the floor out of sight behind the furniture
her confession showed that the entire spiritualism movement was founded on fraudulent events
margaret 's revelations outraged spiritualists
they simply refused to accept the validity of her confession
henry j. newton president of the first spiritual society of new york said the idea of claiming that unseen rappings can be produced with joints of the feet
if she says this even with regard to her own manifestations she lies
i and many other men of truth and position have witnessed the manifestations of herself and her sisters many times under circumstances in which it was absolutely impossible for there to have been the least fraud
margaret wrote a signed story that appeared in the new york world oct. 21 1888
she said spiritualism is a fraud and a deception
it is a branch of legerdemain but it has to be closely studied to gain perfection
one of those who would not accept margaret 's confession was sir arthur conan doyle the creator of the fictional sherlock holmes and a convinced believer in spiritualism
he responded nothing that she could say in that regard would in the least change my opinion nor would it that of any one else who had become profoundly convinced that there is an occult influence connecting us with an invisible world
the magician harry houdini a showman continually alert to opportunities for self promotion publicly exposed mediumistic trickery in his stage shows and wrote pamphlets opposing fraudulent mediums
in spite of this some spiritualists claimed that houdini had genuine spiritualistic powers refusing to accept houdini 's own statements that only deception was involved in his performances
arthur conan doyle devoted a whole chapter of his book the edge of the unknown to a detailed argument that houdini had genuine psychic power but would n't admit it
curiously doyle and houdini remained friends for a long while in spite of public clashes over spiritualism
perhaps they shared an appreciation of the value of public self promotion
eventually houdini became outraged as a result of a seance in which mrs. doyle claimed to have communicated with houdini 's mother and the details she reported were obviously wrong
doyle was a credulous dupe for various kinds of nonsense
he not only believed in spiritualism and all of the phenomena of the seance room but he also believed in fairies
in 1917 two teenage girls in yorkshire produced photographs they had taken of fairies in their garden
elsie wright age 16 and her cousin frances griffiths age 10 used a simple camera and were said to be lacking any knowledge of photography or photographic trickery
photo no 1 above taken in july showed frances in the garden with a waterfall in the backround and a bush in the foreground
four fairies are dancing upon the bush
three have wings and one is playing a long flute like instrument
frances is not looking at the fairies just in front of her but seems to be posing for the camera
though the waterfall is blurred indicating a slow shutter speed the fairies are not blurred even though leaping in the air
here 's a more detailed look at this picture
photo no 1 detail this photo and the four which follow were provided by the james randi educational foundation
these pictures are cropped to show the important details clearly

these are large pictures four times the area of the ones you see in this document and four times the file size
the resolution is however the same
photo no 2 taken in september showed elsie sitting on the lawn reaching out her hand to a friendly gnome about a foot high with wings who is stepping forward onto the hem of her wide skirt
photographic experts who were consulted declared that none of the negatives had been tampered with there was no evidence of double exposures and that a slight blurring of one of the fairies in photo number one indicated that the fairy was moving during the exposure of 1/50 or 1/100 second
they seemed not to even entertain the simpler explanation that the fairies were simple paper cut outs fastened on the bush jiggling slightly in the breeze
doyle and other believers were also not troubled by the fact that the fairy 's wings never showed blurred movement even in the picture of the fairy calmly posed suspended in mid air
apparently fairy wings do n't work like hummingbird 's wings
hardly anyone can look at these photos today and accept them as anything but fakes
the lighting on the fairies does not match that of the girls
the fairy figures have a flat cut out appearance
but spiritualists and others who prefer a world of magic and fantasy accepted the photos as genuine evidence for fairies
three years later the girls produced three more photos
photo no 3
francis and the leaping fairy showed a slightly blurred profile of frances with the winged fairy suspended in mid air just in front of her nose
the background and the fairy are not blurred
hmmm
photo no 4 shows a fairy hovering in mid air offering a flower to elsie
well this fairy may be standing on a branch for the fairy images are of indeterminable distance from the camera
photo no 5
fairies and their sunbath is the only one that looks as if it could have been an accidental or deliberate double exposure
the girls said they could not photograph the fairies when anyone else was watching
no one else could photograph the fairies
there was only one independent witness geoffrey l. hodson a theosophist writer who claimed to see the fairies and confirmed the girls observations in all details
arthur conon doyle not only accepted these photos as genuine he even wrote two pamphlets and a book attesting the genuineness of these photos and including much additional fairy lore
his book the coming of the fairies is still in print and some people still believe the photos are authentic
doyle 's books make very interesting reading even today
doyle 's belief in spiritualism convinced many people that the creator of sherlock holmes was not as bright as his fictional creation
some thought conan doyle crazy but he defended the reality of fairies with all the evidence he could gather
he counters the arguments of the disbelievers eloquently and at great length
in fact his evidence and arguments sound surprisingly similar in every respect to those of present day books touting the idea that alien beings visit us in ufos
robert sheaffer wrote a clever article drawing these parallels beautifully
over the years the mystery persisted
only a few die hards now believe the photos were of real fairies but the mystery of the details of how and why they were made continued to fascinate serious students of hoaxes frauds and deceptions
when the girls as adults were interviewed their responses were evasive
in a bbc broadcast interview in 1975 elsie said i 've told you that they 're photographs of figments of our imagination and that 's what i 'm sticking to
 in 1977 fred gettings stumbled on important evidence while working on a study of early nineteenth century book illustrations
he found drawings by claude a. shepperson in a 1915 children 's book which the girls could easily have posessed and which were without a doubt the models for the fairies which appeared in the photos illustration for alfred noyes poem a spell for a fairy in princess mary 's gift book by claude shepperson
hodder and stoughton no date c. 1914 p. 101ff
compare the poses of these figures with those of three of the fairies in photo no 1
the figures have been rearranged and details of dress have been altered but the origin of the poses is unmistakable
a curious fact is that in this book a compilation of short stories and poems for children by various authors there 's a story bimbashi joyce by arthur conan doyle
surely he received a copy from the publisher
if doyle had noticed this picture and if he had the sort of perceptiveness he attributed to sherlock holmes he might have concluded that the cottingley photographs were fakes
but maybe not
believers are good at seeing what they believe and not seing things that challenge their beliefs
or perhaps the close match of drawing and photos is a supernatural psychic coincidence
elsie and frances and mr. hodson were still living in 1977 and continued to stick to their story affirming the genuineness of the fairies and the photos
then in 1982 the girls admitted in interviews with joe cooper that they had faked the first four of the photos
as many had suspected all along the girls had used paper cutouts of fairy drawings
no great photographic skills were required though the photos do show good artistic composition
elsie had artistic skill and had even worked for a few months in a photographer 's shop retouching photographs
but the girls probably did no retouching on these photos
the simplest of means just cut out drawings of fairies stuck on the shrubbery was all that was required to dupe gullible and predisposed minds like those of arthur conan doyle geoffrey hodson and edward gardner
many of the copies of these photos which have been circulated have been suspected of having been improved by retouching
this certainly may be true of the photos being prepared for publication in books the desire being for the clearest possible result on the printed page
however those who say the pictures are too good to have been taken by teenage amateur photographers are showing an unwarranted prejudice not consistent with the facts revealed by analysis of the original photos
some have claimed to see a slight blurring of the fairy images when in fact the fairies are more sharply defined than the girl 's images
on the matter of conan doyle 's gullibility gilbert chesterton said it has long seemed to me that sir arthur 's mentality is much more that of watson than it is of holmes
