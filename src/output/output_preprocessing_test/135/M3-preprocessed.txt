last updated june 24 2015 7:58 pm in 1917 two little girls took photos of themselves surrounded by what looked like fairies
for the next 70 years they faced the scrutiny of critics accusations of perpetrating a hoax
for decades they maintained that the fairy photos were genuine
after plenty of badgering the story changed slightly but with nonetheless intriguing implications
one of them elsie wright 1901 88 told the bbc in 1977 they ’re photographs of figments of our imagination
some took this as an answer to brush off the media some took it as an admittance of fraud others took this to mean the photos were taken psychically
toshio akai a humanities and sciences faculty member at kobe gakuin university in japan explained what it means to take photos psychically in his paper the cottingley fairies photographs and spirit photography
at the time akai said photographic expert fred barlow was convinced the photos were taken psychically that means the mediumship of the two girls being enhanced with each other enabled them to capture spiritual entities into pictures
barlow was skeptical at first he was considered an expert in psychic photography and particulary in spotting fakes but when an investigator from the theosophical society followed up with elsie and her cousin frances griffiths barlow was convinced
polly wright elsie ’s mother went to a meeting of the theosophical society in bradford in 1919 at which she mentioned the fairy photos to a member wondering if they might be real
word got around to lead theosophist edward gardner by early 1920
gardner went to the girls and gave them photographic plates asking them to take more photos of the fairies
he secretly marked the plates to make sure they were n’t switched
the girls produced three more photos with fairies in them
joe cooper in his 1982 article cottingley at last the truth wrote that both elsie ’s parents searched the girls bedroom and waste paper basket for any scraps of pictures or cut outs and also went down to the beck in search of evidence of fakery
they found nothing and the girls stuck to their story that they had seen fairies and photographed them famed author sir conan doyle took an interest in the case and believed the girls had indeed captured photos of these nature spirits which he called dwellers at the border
elsie ’s father was unconvinced though her mother was persuaded to believe in fairies
arthur wright is quoted by cooper as having said he found it hard to believe these men could be fooled by our elsie and her at the bottom of the class
prominent novelist henry de vere stacpoole wrote of the photographs look at alice ’s face pseudonyms alice and iris were used in publicizing the photos at the time to protect the girls privacy
look at iris ’s face
there is an extraordinary thing called truth which has 10 million faces and forms it is god ’s currency and the cleverest coiner or forger ca n’t imitate it
another photography professional known to be an expert of discerning fakes harold snelling was called in to judge
akai wrote snelling ’s judgment was to confirm that the pictures were not the result of double exposure and some of the objects especially some sprites in the first picture were moving actually when they were photographed
the photos were criticized by some as showing contemporary hairstyles and looking like magazine cut outs
a picture book from the time princess mary ’s gift book was discovered to have had very similar figures in it
proponents of the psychic photography theory chalked this up to the girls mixing in these impressions with the fairies they saw
in 1976 austin mitchell of yorkshire television interviewed frances and elsie back at the beck where the photos were taken
when mitchell asked if elsie faked the photographs frances said of course not
you tell us how she could do it remember she was 16
and i was 10
so then as a child of 10 can you go through life and keep a secret alas in the 1980s the girls changed their story and said they faked the photographs
but they maintained that frances was able to see real fairies and they faked the photographs to get back at the adults who scorned their belief in fairies
they used paper fairies drawn by elsie after models from the princess mary ’s gift book held up by hatpins
though elsie said all the photographs were faked frances maintained that the fifth photo was not faked even though the others were
she told cooper it was a wet saturday afternoon and we were just mooching about with our cameras and elsie had nothing prepared
i saw these fairies building up in the grasses and just aimed the camera and took a photograph
