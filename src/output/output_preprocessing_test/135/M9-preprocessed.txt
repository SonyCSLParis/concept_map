frances griffiths 16 and her cousin elsie wright 10 did
they claimed to play with dancing fairies along the enchanted stream
the beck behind elsie ’s house in cottingley village england and they had 5 photographs to prove it
there in the frames dancing around the girls were four female fairies
when elsie ’s parents saw the photos they did n’t know what to think
elsie ’s father examined them and proclaimed them clever fakes
but elsie ’s mother was n’t so sure
mrs. wright wanted to believe the girls as she was a spiritualist
among the country folk in england at the time was a lively fairy faith

the parents searched the girls shared bedroom and around the beck for scraps of paper to reveal tomfoolery
still nothing turned up
mrs. wright was inclined to believe the girls
her husband made his camera off limits
time passed
at first the photographs were only shared with close friends and family but in 1919 mrs. wright attended a lecture on fairy life bringing the prints with her
by 1920 the prints had come to the attention of one of the leading spiritualists of the time edward gardner who examined them and had two new negatives made clarifying the pictures
the story of the cottingley fairies got even more attention when sir arthur conan doyle creator of the sherlock holmes mysteries learned of them
sir arthur conan doyle was famous for more than his books
he was an outspoken believer in the spirit world
he immediately believed the cottingley fairy story and began writing letters to the wright family in support
doyle published his book the coming of fairies in 1922 maintaining until his death that the cottingley fairies were real
still public opinion was divided
supporters claimed the photos provided long awaited proof of the existence of spirits
others said the photos were nothing more than clever fakes
the cottingley fairy photos caused heated debate
nevertheless the girls held to their story even as they aged
finally in 1983 elsie came clean
she divulged in a letter to a friend that the photographs were indeed a hoax
she described how she and frances had used the fairies in princess mary ’s gift book as inspiration for cut0uts
they then used hatpins to prop up the paper dolls in the bushes for pictures
elsie insisted that they had meant no harm
they were just having a bit of fun
it had been elsie ’s idea as a way to get back at her parents for scolding her little cousin
evidently her mother and father had gotten angry with frances for getting her clothes wet one day while playing in the beck
frances had claimed to be playing with fairies when she ’d fallen and the elder wrights had teased her
elsie had come up with the idea of taking the first pictures to have the last laugh
all along they had planned on confessing their little trick until arthur conan doyle got involved
by then the matter had grown so out of proportion thatthe girls became terrified of a public backlash should they confess
