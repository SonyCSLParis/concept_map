belton house ii the interior the french influence continues inside with the plan two public rooms in the central axis hall and saloon with three apartments of two to three rooms withdrawing room bedchamber and closet on each floor with subsidiary service spaces
that apparently is very close to the french manner of planning a country house like le vau 's vaux le vicomte
there is a touch of baroque too to the original rooms with their luxuriant carvings by edmund carpenter and possibly grinling gibbons just as there are little baroque touches to the exterior the curve of the door pediment crossing the string course on the garden n front and the carving in the pediments
nothing though to frighten the horses
the paneling is a throwback to the tudor period
the greatest room in belton is the chapel but alas the blinds were down
and it was just too dim to photograph so i ca n't show you fantastic the wren style reredos which is of wood painted to resemble marble
looking back through the photos it 's become apparent to me that as we go round houses like belton i tend to photograph the most architectural thing in the room i.e. the fireplace
i 've tried to keep the appearance of the fireplace to a minimum in the following images
the two neo classical rooms are by wyatt the first 1778 replacing the great dining room and the the second 1776 replacing one of the withdrawing rooms
the fireplace in the last picture is by sir edwin lutyens and came from another house
