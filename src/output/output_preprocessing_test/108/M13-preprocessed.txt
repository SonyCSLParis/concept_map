the present house was built between 1685 and 1688 by sir john brownlow and his wife
despite their wealth they decided to build a modest country house instead of a grand palace
yet inside their home it still had all of the latest innovations
little really changed to the design of the house but the interior did over the different generations who lived there according to their taste and social standing
after world war i like so many other the families wealth began to dwindle
in 1984 they gave their house to the national trust who also with the help of national heritage fund brought most of the house contents and 1.317 acres of parkland at the cost of 8 million pounds
they then opened it up to the public
to help support costs the house is used for many different things such as a restaurant wedding venue and filming location
