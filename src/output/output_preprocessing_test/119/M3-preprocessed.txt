the granarykey factsbristolâ€ ™ s most striking example of the famous â€˜bristol byzantineâ€ ™ warehouse style one of the regionâ€ ™ s finest victorian commercial buildings site of a legendary rock music venue part of the cityâ€ ™ s important grain dealing history the granary was built in 1869 for wait james and co.
huge amounts of grain were stored and spread out to dry in this building so it had to be strong stable and warm with maximum ventilation
its many openings provided ventilation and the bricks used were easily heated up from inside to warm the building
arched and round openings are also decorated beautifully with dazzling multicoloured brickwork
this is a striking example of the victorian fashion for using venetian moorish and byzantine features â€ its architects may have been comparing bristol with the great trading ports of istanbul and venice
the building became obsolete soon after completion as warehouses closer to the water took over
its exotic appearance made it the ideal venue lower floors only for a successful jazz and rock venue between 1968 and 1988 hosting acts from genesis to the stranglers
in 2002 the building was converted into flats and a ground floor restaurant without making any dramatic change to the exterior
this is an excellent example of â€˜form following functionâ€ ™ â€ a buildingâ€ ™ s purpose being expressed by its design
however the architects decided to go further and make it very attractive too
they chose a byzantine style design dominated by six levels of arched exotic looking openings of varying height and shape topped by eastern style battlements
the arches contain open work brick grilles which also vary in pattern
machine made bricks were used that came from the cattybrook pit at almondsbury
the building had seven grain floors and its big solid angles contained lifts that took grain to the top
it was then shovelled down through chutes in the floors being dried as it went
large chimneys show that flues ran up inside the walls to heat the brickwork which acted as a giant radiator
the chutes brought grain out through the round openings at the base and into waiting carts
this is one of several important victorian industrial buildings that survive in this part of bristolâ€ ™ s floating harbour and that reflect the predominant use of the area for flour mills
there were many grain merchantsâ€ ™ offices in houses on nearby queen square
the building was commissioned by william wait
he was mp for gloucester and became bristolâ€ ™ s major the year the granary was completed
the building soon stopped being used as a granary because it was set back on the quayside
later warehouses built on the opposite side of the harbour on redcliffe back had direct access to the water
its conversion in 2002 by architects barton willmore shows how buildings can be successfully converted for very different use but keep all of their attractive historic features see more at http://web.archive.org/web/20160416142128/http://bristolopeningdoors.org/the-granary/#sthash.xjlz59u6.dpuf
