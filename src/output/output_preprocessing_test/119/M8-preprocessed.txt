isambard kingdom brunel 1806â€“1859)civil and mechanical engineer isambard kingdom brunel is celebrated as an engineering genius
brunelâ€ ™ s great western railway was designed for speed and efficiency and his daring schemes and record breaking structures are still a vital part of todayâ€ ™ s railway infrastructure
he combined considerable ingenuity with immense boldness of vision in his sometimes controversial achievements
born on 9 april 1806 in portsea near portsmouth isambard kingdom brunel was the third child of marc brunel a french ã © migrã © engineer and english mother sophie kingdom
after an education in both england and france brunel started an apprenticeship with his father on the construction on the thames tunnel in london
he quickly became resident engineer to the project work and he was able to gain considerable experience of a large scale and innovative construction project as well as working knowledge of brickwork and cements that would stand him in good stead for his future engineering projects
the great western railway brunelâ€ ™ s work for a proposed bridge across the river avon at clifton introduced him to the bristol railway committee
in 1833 they engaged him to survey a railway line between bristol and london and he presented his proposals to the committee after only three months
it was an ambitious scheme with carefully planned gradients to make the route as level and straight as possible in order to promote high speed travel on the line
the great western railway act was approved by parliament in 1835 and work on the 116 mile line started in 1836
the line proved considerably more problematic and expensive to construct than brunel had originally estimated not least because of the immense work involved in constructing box tunnel near bath shareholders particularly in liverpool were dissatisfied with brunel and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him from office before the line was completed
his robust defence of the engineering on the line secured his position but debate raged about his use of the broad gauge
engineering feats brunelâ€ ™ s railway from london to bristol required pioneering civil engineering
the wharncliffe viaduct 1837 was the first major structure to be completed by brunel and the first to be completed on the line
in 1839 he persuaded the gwr to allow wires for the new electric telegraph system to be installed between paddington and west drayton taking them over the viaduct
this was the first ever installation of a commercial electric telegraph
unequalled anywhere in the world the arches of the maidenhead bridge 1838 were at the time the flattest brick arches ever built
box tunnel 1840 was the largest work on the line and at the time of construction was the longest tunnel ever constructed
designs for the windsor bridge 1849 for the great western railwayâ€ ™ s branch line and the chepstow bridge 1852 for the south wales railway developed brunelâ€ ™ s thinking for the much larger â€˜royal albert bridgeâ€ ™ 1859 for the cornwall railway
taking the line across the tamar at saltash this bridge used both wrought iron tubular arches and suspension chains to support the rail deck giving it its unique appearance
