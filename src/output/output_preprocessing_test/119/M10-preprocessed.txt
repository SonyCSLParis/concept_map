row erupts over british empire museum 's lost artefacts almost 150 artefacts lent to a museum set up to tell the story of britain 's colonial past may be missing it has emerged with some of them having been sold without their owners permission
trustees of the british empire and commonwealth museum in bristol which has now closed are in talks with about six of the owners about compensation
among them is lord caldecote who said he was shocked to find that a 19th century maritime painting his family had lent to the museum had been sold at auction
much of the museum 's collection has been handed to bristol city council which is carrying out a full audit
police have investigated the loss of objects but have not made arrests or brought any charges
an investigation by bbc 's inside out west programme scheduled to be broadcast on monday claims that 144 objects belonging to eight lenders remain missing
they include the oil painting of an east india company ship dunira by the sailor turned artist thomas buttersworth
caldecote told the guardian that his late father an engineer and industrialist had lent the painting to the museum
after his father 's death he asked for the painting to be returned
i decided i would like the picture back
it turned out the museum had sold the picture through christie 's
i do n't suppose we 'll be able to get it back again
 caldecote said the picture had sentimental value because an ancestor had captained the ship part of the east india company 's fleet and it had been a gift to him
it was a shock when i found out the painting had gone he said
the painting was sold by christie 's to the government of madeira for â£61,250 in 2008
the island can be seen in the background of the picture
neither christie 's nor the madeirans realised that there was any issue with the ownership of the painting
there is an ongoing dispute between the board of trustees of the museum and its former director gareth griffiths over missing artefacts
there is no suggestion that anyone has made personal profit from any sales
the board has criticised griffiths but he insists the care and security of the collection was the trustees responsibility
he said i never benefited from any sales of material and will regard any such inference as actionable
 in march last year sources close to the museum told the guardian only three or four items were missing
neil cossons who took over as chairman of the board of trustees when the museum closed to the public in 2008 conceded the bbc 's figure of 144 may be correct but he could not be sure
he said this was in part because of confusion over the way some objects were counted whether for example a group of african spears was in fact one object or several
he said it was fair to say that dozens of items were unaccounted for but also admitted that it may never be known exactly how many objects went missing
it 's hard to be mathematically precise he said
the museum opened in 2002 in isambard kingdom brunel 's original temple meads station and won a string of awards
bristol was chosen because of its historic connection with empire through voyages of exploration trade â€ including slavery â€ piracy shipbuilding and the railways
however it struggled to attract enough visitors to make it financially viable and a plan was hatched to move the museum to london
the plan fell through after the financial crash
cossons a former chairman of english heritage said the museum had been a good notion but had not worked in the tough economic climate
he said a large number of objects had been returned to their owners
julie finch head of museums galleries and archives in bristol said a full audit which had not been done before was under way
the city council has begun using images and films from the museum to complement its collections
the future looks bright for the collection she added
