lost city of the khmer empire did you know that angkor wat in cambodia is one of the largest and oldest temple complexes in the world surrounded by a large moat and beyond that by an almost impenetrable jungle angkor wat 's origins have fascinated archeologists and tourists alike
last year a team of experts led by australian archeologist dr. damien evans conducted an in depth aerial survey of the region
using a sophisticated laser and radar based technology called li dar light detection and ranging they made an astounding discovery remains of a lost city now covered by thick equatorial forests
the khmer empire the khmer empire controlled the cambodian region and surrounding areas of thailand laos vietnam and myanmar between the 9th and the 15th centuries from their capital in angkor
not much is known about the origins of this kingdom
most of our knowledge comes from the hindu buddhist temples of angkor wat and angkor thom
these temple were only known to local people until the arrival of a french explorer named henry mouhot in the 1860s
and what we know today is pieced together from the inscriptions in those temples
archeologists have long suspected that the forests were hiding the khmer capital city of mahendraparvata
however the dense tropical forests combined with the threat of land mines from the cambodian civil war prevented them from exploring the area
until now
using the 3d imaging capabilities of li dar the team found that this newly discovered city had an extremely well planned layout with temples highways and boulevards
it was supported by a very advanced system of waterworks built using sophisticated hydraulics engineering
the actual site has revealed extensive carvings into rocks and even river beds
a full fledged excavation of the city is being planned
why was the city lost
the region was and is still prone to dramatic climate swings six months of heavy monsoon followed by a equally long but very dry period
read our earlier article on this here
the khmer empire which depended largely on agriculture had figured out how to harness the monsoon rains
they had built a network of canals and reservoirs to store water
with food in plenty the empire prospered
however by the 14th century this clever water management system was under severe pressure from climate changes
as severe monsoons alternated with droughts the waterworks broke down and famines became morefrequent
this was the start of the end
the khmers were forced to migrate to the coast near the current day capital of phnom penh
the abandoned city was soon swallowed up by the jungle where everything rotted away except the stone carvings and temples
meanwhile listen to what dr. evans has to say about his discovery
