angkor wat temple angkor cambodia photo gallery aboutangkor wat is a spectacular temple in central cambodia built by the vanished khmer empire
it was constructed during the reign of king suryavarman ii who ruled from 1113 to at least 1145
in those days it was customary for the khmer empire to maintain a state temple at the heart of the city
however when suryavarman assumed power the existing baphuon state temple was dedicated to shiva
suryavarman worshiped vishnu and wished to honor him with a new temple south of the existing capital
this new state temple came to be called angkor wat meaning the city that is a temple
 the land occupied by the temple measures 1300 meters north south and 1500 meters east west
unlike other khmer temples the entrance faces west in the direction associated with vishnu
a person entering the temple first approaches an entrance causeway that takes him across the 200 meter wide moat
on the opposite shore is an entrance pavilion measuring 230 meters north south
its central bays include three passages that elephants could fit through for royal processions
past the entrance gate is a long causeway that runs for over 300 meters decorated with mythical snake like animals called naga
on either side are isolated buildings called libraries though their true function is unknown
near the temple are two small pools probably built in the 16th century
the temple proper sits on a sandstone plinth a meter above the ground
its perimeter is decorated with naga balustrades
the outer wall of the temple is called the third enclosure and sits on a plinth 3.3 meters high
a continuous gallery runs along the outside face of the wall
the inner face is decorated with 700 meters of continuous bas reliefs
just inside the west gate of the third enclosure is a series of four rooms arranged in a cruciform
each room is surrounded by a continuous gallery with a sunken floor which may have held water
the southern arm of the cross was once called the gallery of a thousand buddhas because until very recently the khmer faithful left buddha statues here
most of these were destroyed during the khmer rouge regime in the 1970s
north and south of the western cruciform are two more libraries
 the second enclosure rests on a base 5.8 meters high
it is linked to the cruciform cloister by a series of stairs
inside this courtyard are still more libraries smaller than the previous ones
the inner enclosure rests on a two tiered pyramid 11 meters tall with 3 stairways on each side each at a 70 degree angle
the upper terrace has a continuous gallery that encloses an inner cruciform of four rooms
five towers jut from the upper tier in a quincunx arrangement like five dots on a pair of dice
the cruciform used to contain a number of separate shrines which now appear to be continuous galleries since the wooden partitions have vanished
the central tower is 65 meters above ground level
