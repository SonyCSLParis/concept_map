vishnu at angkor wat cambodia at the western entrance of angkor wat stands this 5 meters tall statue of vishnu known locally as ta reach revered by hindus and buddhists alike for its representation of the king of the ancestors and spirits
it is carved from a single piece of sandstone and is draped with colorful clothing and offerings from pilgrims visiting the site
angkor wat was dedicated to vishnu who is the supreme god in the vaishnavite tradition of hinduism and venerated as one of the five primary forms of god
this standing stone statue has eight arms and the head of buddha
when angkor wat became a buddhist temple the head of vishnu was replaced with the head of buddha
in my impression angkor wat has several basic colors green for the trees light brown for their roots blackish grey for the stones
what i like in these photos is the contrast between the dark monochromatic body of the statute and the bright colors on the clothes and the parasol
the bright colors really stood out from the whole setting
