old myths and new approaches interpreting ancient religious sites in southeast asia chapter 3mysteries of angkor revealed hydrology and the siting of angkor bob acker lecturer department of geography university of california at berkeley the theoretical setting introductionangkor was the first largest and richest empire in medieval mainland southeast asia
founded early in the ninth century around the great lake on the north cambodian plain it ruled an area that by the end of the tenth century comprised most of modern cambodia southern laos and northeastern and central thailand in the twelfth century it created one of the wonders of the world the gigantic temple complex of angkor wat
the fundamental question in angkorian studies is to determine what factors enabled angkor to become so large and so rich so early
the first comprehensive theory of angkor ’s greatness claimed that angkor grew powerful through intensive rice irrigation based on gigantic rectilinear water holding devices known as baray which permitted rice crops to be grown in the dry season as well as the wet and so fed the army that supported its empire and the workforce that built its temples
in the second half of the ninth century the first baray the indratatāka was built just north of the first capital hariharālaya on the north shore of the great lake
the indratatāka measured about three kilometres along its east west axis and 750 metres along its north south axis given a water depth of three metres it could have held almost seven million cubic metres of water
toward the end of the ninth century the capital moved from hariharālaya to a new site on the banks of the siem reap river about 18 kilometres northwest of hariharālaya and 12 kilometres north of the shore of the great lake
the new capital yaśodharapura was built around an elevation called the bakheng on which the state temple was constructed
a new and much larger baray the yaśodharatatāka was built at around the same time just to the east of the new capital
it measured 7.5 kilometres along its east west axis and 1.8 kilometres along its north south axis with a depth of three metres it could have held 40 million cubic metres of water
about 150 years later in the middle of the eleventh century the largest baray of all the west baray was built just west of the capital district
with an east west axis extending for eight kilometres and a north south axis two kilometres in length and a probable water depth of five metres the west baray was capable of holding around 80 million cubic metres of water.1in short these early capitals were from their very beginning associated with mammoth baray
for several decades beginning around 1960 the dominant explanation for angkor ’s early rise to power and prosperity was based on irrigation and water control made possible by the baray
this was the so called hydraulic thesis chiefly promulgated by bernard philippe groslier of the école française d’extrême orient efeo
groslier hypothesised that water retained in the baray enabled a dry season rice crop to be grown on the land down slope from the baray and also permitted a full wet season crop to be grown even during years of abnormally scanty rainfall in turn supporting angkor ’s army and urban workforce
in short the hydraulic thesis went far beyond agronomy attributing every aspect of angkorian society its economic base labour organisation supposedly centralised politics in fact its entire historical trajectory to baray irrigation groslier 1966 1979
the hydraulic hypothesis however was never quantified or tested
beginning in 1980 criticisms began to accumulate
the hydrologist van liere published two papers whose main thrust was that khmer engineering could not provide the outtake structures needed to distribute water from the baray and that in point of fact no trace of distributary canals could be found downslope from the baray van liere 1980 1982
in 1992 stott restated van liere ’s critiques and added criticisms of his own first that there are no textual references in the very extensive angkorian corpus to any irrigation works of any kind and second that the labour force that built the baray must have pre dated them and could not have owed its sustenance to irrigation from them stott 1992
several years ago i undertook quantitative tests of the hydraulic thesis and these indicated that the baray could not have irrigated more than a small fraction of the land downslope from the baray but above the northern shore of the great lake and that the rice that could have been grown on the land thus irrigated could have fed only a minuscule fraction of angkor ’s population
thus baray irrigation even if it existed can not have been responsible for angkor ’s rise to greatness
i suggested that the baray were part of the urban architecture of angkor and that angkorian agriculture may have been based on another aspect of angkor ’s geography the very high water table underlying most of the north shore of the great lake
recent research christophe pottier of efeo in the course of an extensive exploration of the area down slope from the baray has discovered a network of canals near the southwest corner of the west baray pottier 2001a but while these canals suggest the existence of some sort of hydraulic system related to the baray they nonetheless surround no more than 600 hectares an area utterly insufficient to have supported angkor ’s labour force or to have played a decisive role in the angkorian economy
in addition remote sensing techniques used by roland fletcher of the university of sydney have discovered canals to the north of the capital district fletcher 2000 but these very long canals which have few distributaries apparently served to connect the capital district with the northwestern spur of the phnom kulen range of hills and so may well have been built for purposes of transportation rather than irrigation
in sum these discoveries point to an extensive and well engineered water system for the capital district but if anything seem to argue against the hypothesis that irrigation was the main purpose of the water retention devices around angkor or that the baray played a decisive role in angkorian agronomy
another discovery having to do with the specific siting of angkor may contain a clue bearing on the basis of angkorian agricultural wealth
while it was originally believed that the khmer moved their capital from hariharālaya located near the small roluos river to take advantage of the larger siem reap river at yaśodharapura this has been recently disproved
excavations carried out by pottier have demonstrated that the siem reap river is not a natural river but a diversion from the puok river at a point around ten kilometres north of the capital district further work by the hydrologist terry lustig of the greater angkor project of the university of sydney has shown that the diversionary works were built at the end of the ninth century at the same time the capital moved from hariharālaya to yaśodharapura
but if the siem reap river is a diversion created at the same time as the capital it follows that the capital can not have been relocated to take advantage of the river
to the contrary the capital was moved from a riverside location to one of the few places on the north cambodian plain that had no river and a river was then brought to it
thus some other factor made the new location attractive so attractive that even the mammoth job of diverting a river to that location was justified
the present chapter proposes and tests the hypothesis that the decisive factor in the relocation of the angkorian capital was the high water table surrounding yaśodharapura
specifically it is posited that the new capital was relocated to that part of the north cambodian plain where the ground water resources were the most plentiful and that these water resources underlie the prosperity and greatness of angkor
the high water table hypothesis basic hydrology and agronomy the high water table beneath the north cambodian plain is caused by the combination of the plain ’s geology and climate
a substrate of ancient and largely impermeable sandstone is overlaid by a relatively thin layer of highly permeable quaternary sedimentation meanwhile the region ’s average annual rainfall is about 1,400 millimetres rasmussen and bradford 1977
rainwater infiltrates into the permeable alluvium quite easily but can not infiltrate farther because of the impermeable sandstone just beneath it so that ground water supported by the sandstone layer is found close to the surface of the plain
contemporary cambodian farmers make good use of the high water table to supplement rainfall for their rice crops during the rainy season and to water their domestic animals during the dry season
small tanks artificial ponds dug into the water table are found next to almost every house in rural cambodia garami and kertai 1993 and farm villages are sited next to somewhat larger tanks van liere 1982
the historical record shows that this is no recent practice
chinese travellers of the fifth century noted the presence of village tanks pelliot 1903 and cambodian rural settlements of the eighth century were similarly located around natural and artificial ponds vickery 1986
the combined water holding capacity of large numbers of small and medium sized tanks is enormous
according to stargardt 1983 who studied the ancient agronomy of satingpra an area on the tenasserim peninsula with a water table similar to that of cambodia the average village tank contained 6,000 cubic metres of water during the wet season and 3,000 cubic metres during the dry season
these figures may seem insignificant compared with the large baray at angkor whose capacity was measured in tens of millions of cubic metres
but while the large baray were built by embankments resting on the land surface tanks are dug into the water table and so refill automatically
thus their annual capacity is much greater than their volume an estimate of 500,000 cubic metres per year per tank is not implausible
if there were 800 such tanks in the vicinity of the capital district to adopt a figure found in higham 1989 the tanks in the capital district have had a combined annual capacity of 400 million cubic metres much greater than the capacity of all the great baray combined
prior research on cambodia ’s ground water resources some early research on ground water resources in cambodia has demonstrated a correlation between high water tables and the locations of khmer settlements dating from the earliest times
in 1961 rasmussen collected data on the level of the water table in much of cambodia based on measurements of the water levels in tube wells ordinary wells about a metre in diameter bored into the earth and usually lined with concrete
rasmussen ’s data demonstrates two things relevant to this inquiry
first nearly all of central cambodia has a high water table with water almost always within five or six metres of the surface
second four cambodian provinces kompong thom siem reap svey rieng and takeo have even higher water tables with water found one two or three metres below ground
takeo is the home of angkor borei the earliest seat of khmer civilisation kompong thom is the home of sambor prei kuk the capital of the khmer kingdom in the seventh century and siem reap is the home of the successive khmer capitals between 802 and 1431 hariharālaya yaśodharapura and angkor
only svey rieng located in the borderland between the khmer and cham kingdoms was not the home of an early khmer capital
but while rasmussen ’s data thus contains clues to the importance of high water tables in forming khmer settlement patterns his data is not detailed.2 the number of data points in each province varies from fewer than a dozen to a few dozen the data points are apparently closely grouped within most provinces rather than distributed across the provinces and specific locations of the data points are not provided
before reliable conclusions can be drawn correlating the height of the water table and the location of angkorian settlement centres greater quantities of more widely distributed and specifically located data points with precise information concerning water levels are necessary
hypothesis testing consequently between january and march 2005 i measured the subsurface water levels in 830 tube wells around siem reap province
although i measured water table levels in the middle of the dry season the important consideration was how the water table affected rice farming during the rainy season
to determine this i interviewed farmers virtually all of whom reported that the water level in their wells rises by two metres between the middle of the dry season and the end of the rainy season these reports were verified by checking the water marks on the inside of the wells
the data i collected are displayed on plate 3.1 on which the locations and water table levels of the measured wells are depicted
the levels are classified as very high high mid level or low
these are classified as follows very high water tables blue dots are those within 1.5 metres of the surface when measured halfway through the dry season
with the typical two metre rise by the end of the rainy season the water here will rise to the surface halfway through the rainy season and inundate the land
high water tables green dots are those more than 1.5 but less than 2.5 metres below the surface when measured halfway through the dry season
with the typical two metre rise by the end of the rainy season the water here will nearly or fully inundate the land by the end of the rainy season
mid level water tables yellow dots are those more than 2.5 and less than 3.5 metres below the surface when measured halfway through the dry season
by the end of the rainy season the water here will be approximately a metre beneath the surface by the end of the rainy season
low water tables red dots are those more than 3.5 metres below the surface when measured halfway through the dry season
water here will remain well below the surface throughout the rainy season
plate 3.1 locations and water table levels of measured wells in the southern siem reap province
this map prepared by cameron reed university of california at berkeley depicts most of siem reap province
the location of the first capital hariharalaya is shown by a capital h and the location of the second capital yasodharapura is shown by a capital y. the ninth century east baray and the eleventh century west baray are the two rectangles to the east and west of yasodharapura
the great lake is shown at its smallest dry season extent
the data contained in plate 3.1 is also presented in tabular form
table 3.1 shows the measured water table levels within a seven kilometre radius of the bakong temple at the centre of hariharālaya table 3.2 shows the measured water table levels within a 15 kilometre radius of the bakheng temple mountain at the centre of yaśodharapura table 3.3 shows the measured water table levels in the eastern part of siem reap province east of the roluos river and table 3.4 shows the measured water table levels in the western part of siem reap province and more than 15 kilometres west of the bakheng
groundwater resources and settlement locationsa comparison between the groundwater resources around hariharālaya the first capital and those around the new capital at yaśodharapura shows that the water table is on average significantly lower around hariharālaya
there are 72 data points located within seven kilometres of the bakong the temple at the centre of hariharālaya of which 42 58.3 are high 14 19.4 are very high a further 14 19.4 are mid level and the remaining two comprising 2.9 of the total are low.3 across this area approximately 154 square kilometres in extent the average depth of the water table is slightly greater than two metres below the ground surface halfway through the dry season so that this area on average would not be inundated during the average rainy season.4by way of contrast the new capital of yaśodharapura was situated in the centre of an almost perfect circle approximately 30 kilometres in diameter,5 within which ground water resources are close to the surface
of the 250 data points within this 30 kilometre circle 118 are very high 119 are high and 13 are mid level none are low
the average depth of the water table within this area is slightly greater than 1.5 metres below the ground surface in the middle of the dry season so that virtually the entire region would have been inundated during the rainy season.6there is less variation in water table levels around yaśodharapura than around hariharālaya
as noted water table levels around hariharālaya varied widely with as many mid level data points as very high points
by way of contrast almost all the data points around yaśodharapura were high or very high and the high and very high points were practically equal in number
in short the average variance from the mean water table depth was twice as great around hariharālaya as around yaśodharapura
the region of high and very high water tables around yaśodharapura was much larger than the corresponding region around hariharālaya
the area of the 30 kilometre circle of high and very high subsurface water around yaśodharapura measures approximately 700 square kilometres over four times larger than the significantly lower region within seven kilometres of hariharālaya and around thirty times larger than the slightly lower water table in the region immediately around hariharālaya
moreover a comparison between the area around yaśodharapura and the far eastern and far western parts of siem reap province where no capital was ever sited shows much starker contrasts in water table levels the eastern part of the province has a much lower water table than the regions around either yaśodharapura or hariharālaya
specifically while only 5.2 of the data points around yaśodharapura and 22.3 of the data points around hariharālaya reflected a mid level or low water table 49.6 of the data points east of the roluos river were mid- or low level
moreover the concentration of low and mid level data points increases the farther east one proceeds
between the east bank of the roluos river and the road connecting beng mealea with the shore of the great lake 53 of the data points 73 of 138 are very high or high but between the road and the eastern border of siem reap province 53 of the data points 59 of 112 are mid level or low
the water table in the western part of siem reap province is also much lower than around the capital with especially low water tables found in the area closest to the great lake
in all 50 56 of 112 of the data points in the area between the 30 kilometre circle around yaśodharapura and the western boundary of the province show a mid level or low water table
in the area between national route 6 and the great lake 34 of 48 data points or 70.8 are mid level or low
meanwhile there are 64 data points in western siem reap province to the north of nr 6 of which 22 or 34.3 show a mid level or low water table
moreover while there are regions with very high water tables in the western part of the province practically all of them are found in two clusters
one of these is just northwest of the west baray and so is on the verge of the capital district while the other in the far western part of the province is suggestively located around a cluster of angkorian sites,7 and so was apparently a secondary settlement cluster to the west of angkor
high water tables and angkorian settlement patterns the data presented here strongly confirms the hypothesis that angkorian capitals were sited in the middle of regions characterised by high subsurface water tables
the water table around hariharālaya is significantly higher than the water table found further to the east in the area closer to the older khmer centres
the new capital district at yaśodharapura was in a large region of very high subsurface water far surpassing the location of hariharālaya in size consistency and most importantly proximity to subsurface water
more striking still yaśodharapura was in virtually the centre of that region
finally what may be the largest cluster of angkorian sites outside the capital districts is found in the middle of the only region outside the capital district with very high subsurface water levels
why the capital was placed in the middle of the region with the highest water tablethis very strong spatial correlation raises the question of why regions with high water tables were preferred centres of settlement
i will argue first that high subsurface water levels increase agricultural productivity in several ways and second that the labour requirements of khmer urban development were most easily met when urban sites were placed in the middle of regions of high agricultural productivity
the uses of high water tablesobservation of contemporary farming practices indicates that high water tables make three distinct contributions to cambodian agronomy
first high water tables make rice culture more productive especially in a region of poor sandy soils such as central cambodia
these poor soils can supply only modest amounts of nutrients to the rice plants
but rice originally a swamp plant can obtain nutrients dissolved in ambient water as well as from soil grist 1955
rice farmers surround their fields with low dikes to prevent runoff thus keeping water and the nutrients it contains in the rice field
but while dikes can prevent rainwater from running off horizontally they can not prevent it from infiltrating vertically down into the soil
during weeks of steady rain when the amount of rainfall is greater than the amount of water that sinks into the soil water remains in the rice field and the rice plants can receive nourishment
when the rain is intermittent however water sinks into the soil faster than it is replenished and the field dries out the rice plants can no longer receive nutrients from ambient surface water
infiltration is particularly severe in cambodia with its highly permeable sandy soils
infiltration ceases to be a problem however if the water table is close to the surface even before the rainy season begins
in this case the soil between the water table and the surface is quickly filled by infiltrating rain water in other words the water table rises to the surface as the rainy season proceeds
once this happens the rice field becomes inundated and remains so throughout the rest of the rainy season and even for some weeks after its end so that ambient water continuously supplies nourishment to the rice plants
moreover the higher the water table is to begin with the sooner the rice field is inundated the longer the inundation lasts and the more nutrients the rice plants receive over the course of the growing season
there are two additional ways in which regions with high water tables are more productive than regions with lower water tables
high water tables enable domestic animals to survive the dry season more easily
as the dry season continues and many surface water features dry up stored rainwater may allow human beings to survive but their livestock need groundwater
naturally the closer the groundwater is to the surface the easier it is to dig down to especially with the few and poor tools available to traditional farmers
in addition high water tables make the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables more productive
a high water table means that more moisture reaches the roots of trees leading to higher yields and a very high water table may enable farmers to plant a crop of vegetables in the still wet soil after the rice harvest has been completed
in short relocating the capital from hariharālaya to yaśodharapura at the end of the ninth century moved the khmer centre of settlement from a smaller less agriculturally productive area to a larger more productive one
agricultural productivity and urban location the movement of the capital from hariharālaya to yaśodharapura required not only the construction of an entirely new city but also the diversion of a river and creation of the gigantic 15 square kilometre east baray all at roughly the same time
an enormous labour force was needed to build these gigantic works
where did this labour force come from
at one time it was believed that the ancient khmer used irrigation from the great baray to grow a dry season rice crop that supported a large permanent urban workforce but the baray for all their huge area were not very deep and could not have provided the water to grow enough dry season rice to support tens of thousands of urban workers and their families acker 1998
turning away from the idea of a permanent urban workforce we see at once that as elsewhere in mainland southeast asia an available workforce could be assembled from rice farmers and other agricultural workers in the countryside once the farmers had completed their rice harvest after the end of the rainy season
this rural based workforce would have been available annually for the six months from december through june
as was almost universally the case in traditional mainland southeast asia the labour force that built the temples and baray of angkor was likely divided into two halves with one half put to work during the days of the waxing moon and the other half during the days of the waning moon and during the half month when they were not employed on public construction projects the workers in all likelihood returned to their home villages
this system of bi weekly labour rotation would have worked efficiently only if the workers lived within one or at most two days travel from their urban work place not dozens or hundreds of kilometres away
in other words the system worked best if the urban worksite were situated in the midst of a large thickly settled agricultural zone
the relocation from hariharālaya to yaśodharapura was a move from a smaller less productive and therefore less populated region to a larger more productive and more thickly settled region to a region in other words where the large labour force needed for the urban works of yaśodharapura and later of angkor was readily available
conclusionthis research corroborating the work of earlier scholars demonstrates a strong correlation between high water tables and the locations of medieval khmer centres of settlement reflecting in turn the more productive agriculture found in areas of more abundant ground water resources
this was the khmer response to the problems posed by the nutrient poor permeable sandy soil characteristic of the cambodian plain
the peoples of mainland southeast asia each developed agricultural adaptations best suited to their environments
the dai peoples in the hill country developed the weir and canal system
the mon in the meandering river valleys of the lower chaophraya and the khorat developed moated sites around those river bends
the present research demonstrates that the khmer on the broad but relatively infertile cambodian plain developed their own characteristic form of agriculture one that could take advantage of the strengths and counteract the weaknesses of their environment
