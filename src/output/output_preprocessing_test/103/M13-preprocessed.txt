angkor wat cambodia1
the monument of superlatives doubtlessly the grand temple monument of angkor wat is the best known building and tourist attraction in southeast asia
for many angkor wat is synonym with angkor though angkor was a whole city and even more an empire and as such much much bigger than angkor wat what merely means city temple state temple or temple of angkor
there are about a hundred more major temples in the wider area around angkor wat what is declared angkor archaeological park
one of them is the bayon another and significant different state temple which is situated in angkor thom
angkor wat is a sight of superlatives
it 's the biggest religious monument in the world the most visited sight in southeast asia the best preserved in the whole angkor archaeological park the most impressive monument for most of the visitors the only religious site of whole angkor which remained a significant religious center since it 's foundation until today it represents the top of the high classical style of khmer architecture it 's the symbol for cambodia since 1863 and decorates the national flag of cambodia and maybe there is more to add causeway over angkor wat 's moat the first glance from the distance the outside bank of the moat at the sandstone bridge
opposite the bridge is the western gate of the outer wall

a history of angkor wat the great state temple angkor wat was supposedly built in the early 12th century in the reign of king suryavarman ii 1113 1145/50 ce as his mausoleum in the khmer capital of the time yasodharapura
it was originally dedicated to the hindu god vishnu
though some historians claim a later date as building time for angkor wat
the monument shows a stilistic and architectonical refined building style and is supposed by some specialists to be erected after the bayon style of angkor thom around 1200 ce was invented
the precondition for the construction of angkor wat and the many many other great temple complexes of angkor was laid in the time around 900 ce
in the reign of yasovarman i 889 910 a great irrigation system was built consisting of canals and artificial ponds
the improved irrigation then allowed the local population to harvest rice several times a year
abundance of food and growing wealth allowed the khmers to spare a considerable part of the population from food production and to deploy them into handicraft and construction work
angkor city is nowadays considered to have been the largest pre industrial city in history
it was inhabited by up to a million people
when suryavarman ii decided the erection of angkor wat he let it placed into the southeastern corner of angkors capital of the time yasodharapura
the positioning of angkor wat 's main entrance facing to the west is considered by historians as an indication that the grand temple was meaned to serve as a burial site for the king for the west is the direction of yama the hindu god of the underworld
the original name of the grand monument is unknown
presumably it was named after vishnu
the name angkor wat was invited in the late 13th century after the state religion changed repeatedly and became eventually theravada buddhism
angkor was maybe twice sacked by siamese troops
the second time was in 1431 ce after a several month lasting siege of angkor thom by an army from ayutthayua
the siamese also pillaged angkor wat and damaged it
this date is of great significance for southeast asia 's history
although decline due to other reasons was already ongoing the year 1431 marks formally the end of the angkorean empire
it never recovered the defeat
in the following time the khmer capital moved to other places like udong or phnom penh and as an empire it never gained an important influencial or powerful role anymore
on the contrary it was from then on under pressure from both sites the west where the siamese set further pressure on it and from the east where a new conquering people the annamese vietnamese approached closer to cambodia 's borders and began to eat it up
angkor wat was the only angkorean monument in angkor which was never completely abandoned
over all the centuries after the khmer capital was shifted the magnificent temple remained an active religious center
originally a hindu temple angkor wat changed to an important center of worship for theravada buddhists
in the post angkorean time between 1546 and 1747 ce more than 40 buddhist engravings were attached to angkor wat
it is still a center of buddhist worship and besides the many tourists who visit angkor wat daily are buddhist pilgrims visiting the site
south and northwest of the monument still on the island are two much newer buddhist temples placed
interestingly there has never been a westerner in angkor when it was still a capital and cultural center of great importance
the first westerners who arrived at angkor were some priests from portugal in 1568 ce among them antonio da magdalena
at this time most of angkor was already abandoned overgrown by tropical rainforest and the time of the formerly so powerful empire which once ruled most of indochina was already history
a few western missionaries and merchants followed but angkor was n't of interest for the western world
angkor wat attracted wider attention after the french naturalist henri mouhot visited and explored the site in 1860 and published his observations in a travel narrative travels in siam cambodia laos and annam
mouhot compared angkor wat with ancient salomo 's temple built by an antique michelangelo and dated it back more than 2,000 years
he could n't imagine the uncivilized and barbarious khmer people to have built such a magnificent building
from then on other explorers and scientists followed to visit the site like adolf bastian who identified the temple as of hindu origin and angkor wat became known in the western world
angkor was also a reason for the french empire to incorporate the region into their colonial possessions
when france established a protectorate over the remaining almost extinct cambodia of 1863 it expanded in the following decades 1907 to the angkor region around siem reap what was then part of siam
the only good thing france did in it 's colonial time in indochina was probably the beginning of the restoration of a number of ancient buildings namely angkor wat at first under the supervision of the école française d’extrême orient
angkor wat although the biggest monument there is only a comparably small part of the whole archaeological angkorean ensemble
it 's surroundings were also inhabited by the people of the time
all of the secular buildings were built of wood and nothing of it is left
stone was exclusively reserved for temple constructions
it 's very remarkable that practically no remains of the people were found such items as pottery pieces of weapons or clothing who are found generally at formerly inhabited historical sites

the purpose of angkor wat interestingly there was a great difference between angkor wat and other grand religious monuments of world 's history as the great cathedrals in europe the mosques in the islamic world or other hindu or buddhist temples of the past or the present as magnificient borobodur in java
angkor wat was dedicated to vishnu one of the central hindu gods
but angkor wat 's vishnu is another vishnu than the one celebrated in other hindu temples
angkor wat 's vishnu is suryavarman ii the godking himself who was seen as a reincarnation of the old god
the numerous statues of vishnu and shiva in angkor wat show the traits of suryavarman ii
it is a monument to eternalize the grandeur of the devaraja the godking
so the grand khmer temple was not built for the common people to go and to pray
if they were ever allowed to go there it was only to grovel at the feet of their king 's devine images
angkor wat was exclusively designed as the godkings personal grave and access was allowed only for the highest members of society

architecturethe basic idea of angkor wat is similar to many other hindu temples
it symbolizes the universe with it 's center mount meru represented by the main central tower prasat and it 's surroundings including the oceans represented by the moat
the main prasat is 65 m high and accompanied by four others who are slightly lower
their shape is made analogous to a lotus bud
the whole artificial island plus the moat is stretching over 1.5 km in west east direction and 1.3 km in north south direction
the moat is around 180 m wide
the buildings consist mostly of sandstone more than 5 million tons which was brought from mount kulen some 40 km northeast
other parts who are mostly not visible are made of laterite e.g. the outer walls or bricks
the siem reap river and the artificial canals of angkor served at least partially as a transport way for the building material from the quarries to here
there was no mortar used to combine the big stone blocks they were shaped in a high precision so that they fit perfectly together
the construction time for angkor wat lasted about 35 years
that 's an incredible short time for a project of this size
compared with the european cathedrals of medieval times the old khmer built and carved very quick though performing the highest quality of work and art
access to the artificial island is given by a sandstone causeway from the west the representative main entrance and by an earth dam from the east
it might be there were one or two more bridges to the north and the south in the old times
angkor wat inner gallery the inner gallery of angkor wat image by asienreisender 2006 many of the temple 's walls are decorated with engraved figures
many of them are dancers apsaras devine beings
all the apsaras are individual
the base reliefs of the third gallery show on 1.000m2 space historical scenes and episodes from the ramayana and other hindu myths
as at all the other angkorean buildings all the former stuccowork does not exist anymore
much of the decoration has been looted above all the metal bronze parts were a major target for tomb raiders the wooden parts like doors or ceilings have been taken away or rot to nothing over the centuries
in the times after angkor wat was built and in it 's original shape it must have given a very different general appearance as it does now
the workforce for the temple construction must have been enormously
the technologies used for the mammoth project have been developed centuries earlier as stone witnesses show elsewhere but the scale and the perfection of the work at angkor wat are incredible
and not to forget it all was good old handwork without the usage of modern machinery
the strongest force the old khmer workers and artisans had were elephants for transport and placement of big blocks but the carving was all done piece for piece with all the many many individual details by hand
literally every square centimeter at angkor wat has been shaped by craftsmen
however it 's not to forget that the hardest work was done by an army of slaves who drained in pushes after any war campaign into the empire
tenthousands of slaves have died and more have suffered enormously to fullfill the target a monumental tomb for the khmer king
north of the temple was the royal palace placed
as all secular buildings it was n't built of stone and is therefore completely bygone
the central domes of angkor wat the steep climb up to the central towers prasats of angkor wat
in the old times the way up here was only granted to the highest religious authorities
in small chambers are the shrines for the central gods
image by asienreisender 2006 the moat of angkor wat the grand monument is surrounded by a moat which is 180 m to 200 m wide
there are two access causeways to the temple the main one unusually for an angkorean temple approaches from the west and the second one leaves the site to the east

restorationalthough angkor wat was the best preserved building in whole angkor it was nevertheless in a poor state in the early 20th century compared with it 's original shape
restoration history of the building is a never ending one
it was interrupted in the time of the cambodian civil war and the time of democratic kampuchea
although the monument in general remained optically impressing statues were destroyed or stolen carvings destroyed or altered
the restoration is continuously going on since the early 1990s
some of the earlier restoration efforts by the way caused rather more damage than did somewhat good
since we do not exactly know how the grand building looked in it 's original shape there is no way of a whole restoration of it
nowadays the whole angkorean world heritage is privatized
cambodias biggest oil trust sokimex is managing the site and holds the rights to cash the visitors since 1990
running angkor makes big money
considered that every year more than a million visitors pay a high entrance fee 65 us$ for a three day ticket in 2006 less than a third of the revenues are spent for the restoration of the site
a great deal of the restoration work is done by foreign institutions funded with money from other countries and private donations
many of the cambodian workers in these restoration teams do n't get paid
the cambodian government itself does little for angkor 's preservation
angkor wat is part of the angkor world heritage site of the unesco since 1992
6 tourismince the un intervention in cambodia in 1993 the number of visitors of angkor is increasing every year
angkor archaeological park and above all angkor wat is a mass tourist destination
the top three countries the visitors are from are south korea vietnam and china
though there has been relatively little direct damage at the ancient buildings due to tourism
with the steep increase of visitor numbers this is changing
many visitors climb the ruins and touch the carvings
as a mass appearance it harms the monuments
the amount of litter around is therefore mostly an insult for the eyes
tourists at angkor wat by asienreisender masses of tourists visit angkor wat every day and the number is steeply increasing
it 's causing a problem for the old buildings meanwhile
here we see the main causeway approaching the main building seen from the west gate of the outer wall image by asienreisender 2006 siem reap the nearby cambodian town and base for a visit to angkor has grown like cancer in the last twenty years
there are all kinds of accommodation from very low budget level to large luxurious hotels
since there are actually no construction regulations the wild growth is harming the landscapes
noise air water pollution and traffic are growing
the great water and energy consumption of tourism has overstretched the capacities of siem reap
notably the ground water level is decreasing now threatening the structural stability of the historical temples themselves
not to mention the impact of easy tourist money on the local population the social system and the local values
tourism is always euphemized as an economic benefit and developer but the disadvantages are frequently played down
and there is much more to say about it than that tourism comes with prostitution human trafficing and drug dealing
different worlds clash over business who do n't understand each other
angkor wat painting angkor wat on a painting in a hotel
in practically any hotel guesthouse restaurant and many other public and private buildings one finds paintings of the large monument
not few of them are quite bombastic in size
