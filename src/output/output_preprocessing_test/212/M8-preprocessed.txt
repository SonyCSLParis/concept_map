biography‘little p as lord eldon dubbed him was an unlikely candidate for the highest political honours the impecunious younger son by his second wife of a courtier whose brief tenure of cabinet office was remarkable only for his silence and who died when perceval was ten he had his own way to make
after diligent studies at harrow and cambridge where he was tinged with the ideas of the evangelical anglicans he practised as a barrister on the midland circuit
modest and timid though of excellent temper and engaging manners he did not find business enough to match his undoubted talents for several years but his connexions and his industry redeemed his plight
the influence of his mother ’s family the comptons of castle ashby made him deputy recorder of northampton and his elder brother lord arden ’s being a lord of the admiralty in pitt ’s administration improved his prospects
when he married arden ’s wife ’s sister in 1790 he was a commissioner of bankrupts
he next secured for life a legal sinecure worth £ 119 a year
he published anonymous pamphlets in favour of the continuance of warren hastings ’s impeachment and in defence of public order against sedition
he was junior counsel for the crown at the trials of thomas paine 1792 and john horne tooke 1794 and acted as the law officers midland deputy in prosecuting a publisher of the rights of man at knutsford
to his radical opponents he appeared a short spare pale faced hard keen sour looking man with a voice well suited to the rest
his private practice prospered and by 1795 he was worth £ 1,000 a year
in 1794 arden after failing in a bid to do so in 1791 had secured him the place of counsel to the admiralty.1perceval ’s ambitions were confined to professional honours and he rejected hints of a political career
when late in 1795 thomas pelham wished to give up the irish secretaryship he was thought of by pitt and portland as an eligible successor as thomas steele declined the lord lieutenant camden had an office in reversion to tempt him with and earl spencer urged him to accept it
but perceval rejected pitt ’s offer of 2 jan. 1796 for his growing family ’s sake fearing an inexcusable profusion of the public money
instead in the same month he obtained a silk gown.2
in may 1796 he entered parliament unopposed for northampton at the desire of his cousin lord compton who had succeeded to the earldom and whose heir was a child
perceval regarded the tenure of the seat as a family trust and at the ensuing general election refused to coalesce with a candidate friendly to administration
he survived this his only contest with ease and though tempted to stand for his university in 1806 and 1807 retained the seat until his death
pitt contemplated perceval ’s seconding the address but nothing came of it and he hoped to make his parliamentary debut on the austrian subsidy 13 dec. 1796 attacking fox violently and inveighing against the spirit of democracy which he considered a greater threat to the constitution than the power of the crown now minimized by the growth of enlightened public opinion but no such speech was reported
on 24 feb. 1797 he voted silently against the quaker relief bill with most of the lawyers
yet he had won a prize for declamation at cambridge had been a prominent participant in the crown and rolls debating society and prepared assiduously to figure in debate
drafts of his speeches by no means all of them delivered survive for instance he drafted attacks on combe ’s motion and fox ’s attempt to repeal the treason acts 19 may 1797 in support of stern measures after the mutiny at the nore next day and against grey ’s motion for parliamentary reform 26 may but only the gist of the nore speech was reported and that on 2 june
it was his speech of 4 jan. 1798 in defence of the assessed taxes in which he denounced the foxite secession and panacea of reform and french liberty that established his reputation and according to an enthusiastic pitt sent fox home very sick to his supper
pitt was reported to have looked to perceval as a future leader of the house and even according to a family tradition to have regarded him as the most competent person to succeed himself had he perished in his duel with tierney.3in
august 1798 perceval became solicitor to the ordnance which made him £ 300 p.a
the richer unlike the appointment of solicitor general to the queen for which his name was canvassed and which was honorary.4 he made himself useful in debate by replying to tierney 22 dec. 1798 and also by defending the income tax 31 dec. 1798 and 17 apr. 1800
he defended the helder expedition 10 feb. the campaign in egypt 18 nov. 1800 and was frequently a government teller on 29 jan. 1800 he deputized for pitt who was ill
on 11 feb. 1799 he defended the union with ireland though he did not regard it as a nostrum against catholic pretensions of which he was critical
in the debate on mildmay ’s monastic institutions bill 23 june 1800 he sounded an alarm about catholic proselytism
he justified the suspension of habeas corpus 11 dec. 1800 but had opposed the government 5 july 1800 and been teller for the noes on the bread monopoly during scarcity preferring a free market
by 1800 perceval earned £ 2,600 a year £ 1,800 of it at the bar
his private reputation was without blemish and he was a castigator of fashionable vices such as adultery against which he advocated legislation henry bankes maintained that perceval was as likely as any man to frame a well digested and rational bill
his wife was an authority on confinements and their growing family by now required the house next door in lincoln ’s inn fields
he was an authority on biblical prophecy and in an anonymous pamphlet of 1800 predicted the fall of buonaparte
privately he thought the french revolution was a divine instrument for the downfall of catholicism and concluded that the world would end in 1926.5perceval had no sympathy for pitt ’s resignation over catholic relief in 1801 and the succession of addington provided him with further advancement
he became solicitor general refusing a knighthood as the son of a peer and in the spring of 1802 succeeded law as attorney general
he transferred his own practice from king ’s bench to chancery doubling his fees and outdistancing financial anxiety by 1804 he earned nearly £ 10,000 a year
politically he soon discovered himself to be embarrassed by addington ’s administration in which his brother arden held office privately he disliked the peace preliminaries favouring the retention of malta and the cape as military bases
in debate he confined himself to law business as much as possible otherwise defending the resort to coercion in ireland and the exclusion of horne tooke from parliament and opposing the prince of wales ’s claims to the duchy of cornwall revenues 31 mar. 1802 on which subject he was adviser to the cabinet
he further defended the navy estimates defence precautions and the renewal of war in 1803
addington need no longer frown at the warlike venom of that little spitfire perceval as creevey had observed him to do
after this he felt more committed to government and staunchly defended them after emmet ’s rebellion in ireland of which lord redesdale now his brother in law sent him fiery denunciations which strengthened his own prejudices
he stood by addington in the defence debates that heralded the minister ’s fall particularly in reply to fox ’s motion of 23 apr. when he wound up successfully if vituperatively for government and in reply to canning on 25 apr. 1804.6perceval had become less insistent on purely professional success he had refused the vacant chief justiceship of the common pleas with a peerage in the autumn of 1803
although he claimed that if pitt had coalesced with fox on succeeding addington in 1804 he would have given up public life and accepted the chief justiceship of chester his conditions for agreeing to stay in office under pitt namely that fox was excluded that addington was not made a scapegoat and that catholic relief was ruled out proved no obstacle to his doing so
on 13 and 14 may 1805 he made a full statement in reply to fox of his objections to catholic relief in so far as it meant political enfranchisement on 8 may 1804 he had expressed his dislike of parliamentary reform
on the other hand he was a steady friend and advocate of the abolition of the slave trade.7 as a law officer he incurred the hostility of the radicals for his prosecution of despard and peltier in 1803 and cobbett in 1804 and doubtless also for his resistance to the disgrace of melville april june 1805 but he may be credited with a bill instigated by jeremy bentham to mitigate the convicts passage to botany bay with a liberal interpretation of the combination acts against trade unions and an unsuccessful bid to promote the regulation of all child labour
his attempts begun in april 1805 and continued for several years to promote a resident clergy or alternatively an adequately paid curacy in the anglican church were also unavailing
perceval was an emblem bearer at pitt ’s funeral and offered £ 1,000 towards a subscription to pay pitt ’s debts
pitt ’s death made him poor again
seeing no prospect of a pittite government he and castlereagh consulted with pitt ’s other leading friends 8 feb. 1806 as to the best course of action and agreed that while lord grenville was the natural leader of their party it was perceval who suggested the device of a trustee to release grenville from the auditorship of the exchequer so as to be first lord of the treasury his coalition with fox and exclusion of themselves obliged them to prepare for opposition until grenville could shake off fox or the king shake off both
canning his obvious competitor in debate was willing for perceval to take the lead in opposition if necessary and it was perceval who promoted the opposition stand against ellenborough ’s admission to the cabinet but it was ill organized and defeated by 222 votes to 64 3 mar. 1806.8in the ensuing session in which long speeches were an opposition tactic perceval spoke about 70 times notably in criticism of windham ’s military reforms he made the attack on the chelsea hospital bill his own subject
contemptuous of the government ’s incompetence over business details he was resolved by may 1806 not to join them though he disliked the idea of a formal opposition veto on it as concerted in july
at a meeting at lord lowther ’s 4 july he was earmarked in his absence as a future chancellor of the exchequer and leader of the house with the concurrence of canning and castlereagh
lords hawkesbury and bathurst had no objection even to his being premier but he was not informed of this nor did he learn the details of grenville ’s overtures to canning to join the government in which office for him was also stipulated.9early in october 1806 perceval was sounded by grenville whose brother the marquess of buckingham was very eager to gain him through lord ellenborough but he made it clear that he would not be an individual recruit to government and that he looked to a general arrangement
he did not even ask what the bait was but had it been judicial office he would probably have disliked it
he advocated active opposition when it transpired that fox ’s death would lead to no new arrangement and encouraged by eldon hawkesbury and castlereagh passed to the offensive in the new parliament november 1806
he opposed the address 20 dec. though without proposing an amendment
he did not however succeed in rallying opposition and dependent on an allowance from his brother at a time when canning had made it clear to perceval that he was prepared to make his own bargain with government he was momentarily tempted to do the same but while reckoned by others the best debater now in the house he did not overrate himself as a catch for government and disagreed too strongly with them on such issues as anglo american relations peace prospects the case of the princess of wales and catholic relief to pursue the matter
he had criticized the american intercourse bill june july 1806 and in january february 1807 deplored the effect of the orders in council on anglo american relations made a remarkable speech one of several in which his hearers were reminded of pitt on 5 jan. 1807 on the failure of peace negotiations and taken the lead in advocating the princess ’s grievances against her husband
if the prince was so annoyed by perceval ’s opposition to mrs fitzherbert ’s claim to the guardianship of the child minny seymour early in 1806 that he felt he could jump on him and stamp out his life with his feet he must have been further irritated by perceval ’s formal defence of the princess as a much injured lady
this masterpiece of legal prose was not published at the time perceval ’s friends objected
the princess asked for publication to blackmail the court but the government fell before the delicate investigation was circulated and perceval had the satisfaction of framing the new government ’s formal exoneration of the princess 21 apr. 1807 which recommended her reinstatement at court.10perceval made it clear in his speeches of 4 and 5 mar. 1807 that he was an inveterate opponent of catholic emancipation
he was accused of raising the cry of no popery
a week later lord sidmouth resolved to go out of office on this issue approached perceval to concert opposition to it but the government fell before anything came of this
perceval did nothing to promote its fall privately urging a compromise with the king
in portland ’s administration he wished only to be attorney general again and to continue his bar practice and on 20 mar. refused the exchequer with the lead in the house as £ 3,700 p.a was totally inadequate
nor could he swallow a compensatory arrangement i detest the idea of reversionary pension or place
the home office with the lead which would mean £ 6,000 a year might tempt him but on the whole he thought he could do more good as attorney general
portland did not wish to press him against his will but on 23 mar. he allowed himself to be persuaded by his friends
his fitness was described by hawkesbury to the king as a matter of being of an old english family and from his sentiments being known to correspond so entirely with those of your majesty on the subject of the catholic claims
thus qualified for the exchequer the lead and the duchy of lancaster made up to £ 4,000 p.a
perceval found the house of commons to whom in a draped coat he stated the largeness of his family not so easy to please when his provision was debated on 24 and 25 mar. he was conceded the duchy during pleasure only and not for life by 208 votes to 115
he was nevertheless in lord grenville ’s phrase the real minister the aged portland having little to say in the unsteady government to which he had offered his name
canning later alleged that perceval ’s precedence was to a certain degree the result of a compromise between castlereagh and me but this shows hindsight and underestimates perceval ’s ability lord mulgrave thought him the ablest man in the house of commons’.11perceval endeared himself at once to the saints by ensuring the passage of the slave trade abolition bill if not also by moving house from belsize to clapham for a year but he met with less encouragement in other quarters
the opposition fumed about his re election address to his constituents on taking office calling the country to the defence of king and church 27 mar. and his bland speeches on the subject 9 and 15 apr. 1807 even his colleagues found his draft of the king ’s speech dissolving parliament so vehement as to require toning down
he was uncertain of his colleagues canning shirked attendance to hear the king ’s speech on the eve of the new parliament and he had failed to get his closest friend lord harrowby into the cabinet
not surprisingly in debate he seemed to want nerves
he hesitates and stammers and certainly as yet is quite different in his manner reported an opposition witness.12in the recess of 1807 8 perceval who apart from being installed by portland as locum tenens at 10 downing street had at last found a commodious family residence of a plain but desirable character at ealing drafted the controversial orders in council in retaliation against buonaparte ’s continental embargo
he also prepared the justification of the attack on copenhagen january 1808 which the king toned down but which perceval ably presented in debate
described at this time as a prompt ardent speaker very bold to enter the enemies quarters and often happy in severe invective and sarcasmy he was less happy on subsequent issues
opposition harried him over his bid to regulate the export of jesuits bark for quinine to france 23 feb. 16 mar. 1808 and his attempt to relieve the west india sugar planters
his obstruction to the claims of john palmer was bitterly attacked by them may june 1808
moreover his leadership of the protestant ultras in opposition to the maynooth college grant revealed the division in the cabinet on this issue
perceval wished to let the roman catholic know that he has got as much as a protestant parliament can give him and that he must be contented he would not compromise even over tithes
he denied that he was eternally opposed to catholic claims but his answer to the problem a reform of the irish police and more anglican churches hinted at the bigotry he denied
ministers made no attempt to defend the appointment of patrick duigenan to the irish privy council when it came under fire 11 may 1808 but perceval gained his main point the rejection of the catholic petition on 25 may with ease.13in the financial field he was a tyro but found the house less critical on budgetary policy than it was on economic reform a cause shared by the saints and the opposition
the finance committee was remodelled in 1807 to reduce opposition members but its reports were a source of embarrassment
perceval embodied the recommendations of its report on the national debt in his budget of 1808 but the third report on places and pensions was delayed by his insistence on extending its scope to all beneficiaries and not members of parliament only so that it did not appear until the summer of 1810
meanwhile he blocked henry bankes ’s reversion bill by enlisting arden ’s help in the lords in 1807 only to find that in the following year when he was willing to let it pass his brother who held a sinecure worth £ 38,000 a year would not co operate for which opposition harried him thereafter nor would the king budge from neutrality
in april 1809 perceval came to terms with bankes and a bill passed which was limited to a year
from 1810 to 1812 bankes tried to make it perpetual but perceval aided by his brother in the lords blocked him until in march 1812 bankes again capitulated for a bill of limited duration
if in some cases perceval ’s obduracy seemed to exacerbate divisions in the cabinet in others he had to combat the extremism of his colleagues
unlike canning and castlereagh he was prepared though he defended them in debate to revise the orders in council in the spring of 1808 to counter american hostility
when that autumn there was a public outcry against the convention of cintra perceval and castlereagh resisted canning ’s demand that sir arthur wellesley should be their scapegoat and perceval rescued wellesley ’s reputation 25 jan. and 21 feb. 1809 at the risk of alienating canning
in february and march 1809 he played counsel for the defence of the duke of york in the house
it was a brilliant performance jeopardized by his client ’s bold front in denying all charges and by the obduracy of his client ’s father
perceval was able to dispose of the charges but the scrutiny of the duke ’s and his former mistress mary ann clarke ’s correspondence left such an unfavourable impression by 21 feb. that he warned the king that his son ’s future as commander in chief of the army hung in the balance
he could secure the duke ’s acquittal but not without censure and would have to combat the duke ’s removal from his office
he was prepared to try but advised the king that the duke ’s voluntary resignation would answer best 14 mar.
the king resisted this just as he had toned down perceval ’s draft censure
on 15 and 17 mar. perceval won the battle of votes but warned the king that unless the duke resigned there would be further trouble
on 18 mar. the duke resigned
a dinner in his honour at downing street was his immediate reward and perceval ’s assurance that his disgrace was temporary augured his reinstatement two years later.14the divisions of march 1809 had shown the house at variance with public opinion and there followed a series of radical onslaughts
perceval who could no longer count on the support of the saints extricated himself with more ease than his colleague castlereagh from the charges of corruption brought forward against them by william alexander madocks in may 1809 feeling no guilt whatsoever
unlike some of his cabinet colleagues he deprecated curwen ’s reform bill of that month which he regarded as excluding the government from the market of seats in parliament in which they were wo nt to be the most favoured customer a threat to the balance of the constitution
he therefore amended the bill drastically to safeguard the influence of the crown even in its attenuated form however it curtailed government ’s electoral influence
he had no difficulty in getting the house to reject burdett ’s more extreme proposals 15 june 1809
but it was not merely the radicals who thought he was pace lord malmesbury an evading lawyer without principle’.15it was not until 22 june 1809 that perceval learnt of the royal plan for a reshuffle to prevent the resignation of canning which would in the duke of portland ’s view ruin his ministry
canning at once objected not only because a reshuffle could not be carried out with justice to castlereagh the day after the cabinet had approved his plan of the scheldt expedition but because the whole business implied intrigue and want of good faith between colleagues
perceval who to quote john william ward joined great simplicity to great acuteness and knew nothing of the wicked world wrote to canning on 25 june to tell him so
canning pointed out in reply that the concealment was not his idea but perceval was not satisfied
it was not that he was against the reshuffle itself but that he shunned the thought of some expedient which is not satisfactorily justifiable and honourable towards castlereagh
accordingly he informed portland on 13 july that he would submit to any rearrangement and any new premier from among themselves provided castlereagh could be satisfied and offered to mediate with him
the admission of canning ’s friend lord granville leveson gower into the cabinet that month was offset by the admission of perceval ’s friend harrowby
canning was mustering his forces in a bid for the premiership and portland ’s stroke in august 1809 made the choice of a successor desirable
perceval informed william huskisson on 21 aug. that he would not consider presiding over such a government of departments as portland had submitted to
a week later he sounded canning explaining that his own favourite was harrowby but that harrowby had declined any of them with a little more of the responsibility of the treasury than the duke had would do
canning at first refused to be drawn but on 31 aug. admitted that he looked to a premier in the commons and that he could not serve under perceval
this did not surprise perceval but lord liverpool after seeing this correspondence assured perceval that his colleagues would not serve under canning
perceval was in a quandary as to whether it was a degradation to himself to serve under canning as home secretary with canning taking the treasury the exchequer and the lead his brother assured him that it was
he therefore agreed with liverpool and lord bathurst to resist canning ’s pretensions and hearing that canning meant to resign over the failure to implement the pledge given him after the scheldt expedition wrote to him suggesting that they serve under any third person
he also wrote with his friends concurrence to portland urging him to resign and thus facilitate a rearrangement of the government without any disgrace to castlereagh whose removal would have caused perceval to resign and he thought the break up of the government
portland agreeing to resign perceval assured canning that this was the way out of the maze canning demurred for the game was not going his way
bathurst had already assured the king that perceval the most straightforward man he had almost ever known was preferable in their eyes to canning who insisted on resigning and placing the whole matter of the pledge made to him though without perceval ’s consent as an obstacle to any conciliation
canning ceded the field to perceval 12 sept. 1809.16without canning the cabinet could only turn to lords grey and grenville for support and on 18 sept. they met at perceval ’s and recommended this course of action to the king
perceval refused the latter ’s proposal that a written pledge against catholic relief could be required of the two peers arguing that it could only be implied
on 24 sept. the bid was made refused peremptorily by grey and at length by grenville they did not listen to terms
perceval claimed that he intended a real coalition not a mere accession and that he would have served under either of them asking only for the home office for himself
encouraged by his brother to believe that it was his duty to stand by the crown he had failed to win over the opposition
canning was also out of reach not only did he regard himself as outmanoeuvred by a lawyer ’s trick in the struggle for power but he had tried to oust perceval in the king ’s favour by offering to form an administration of his own in which perceval was to be pensioned off with a peerage the lord presidency and the emoluments of the duchy of lancaster or possibly become lord chancellor
this was as perceval reflected to put an extinguisher on my head in the shape of a coronet
but on 30 sept. the rump of the cabinet recommended perceval in all but name to the king and on 2 oct. the king acquiesced
wilberforce thought perceval ’s eminence was not of his own seeking
arbuthnot maintained that perceval had the best regulated ambition i ever witnessed and lord mulgrave that perceval has in all this business put self out of the question more than any man i ever saw
canning had to content himself with accusing perceval of circulating their private correspondence to discredit him and poisoning the press against him neither of which accusations was warranted though perceval ’s sending castlereagh canning ’s correspondence with portland may well have been the unwitting cause of castlereagh ’s issuing a challenge to canning.17 perceval ’s gaining lord wellesley for the foreign office when canning expected him to resign with him exacerbated matters though wellesley proved a liability to the government canning had already been disappointed in the hope that george rose charles long robert pemberton milnes and lord fitz harris would go out with him in the wake of lord granville leveson gower huskisson and william sturges bourne
perceval did not vacate his seat on becoming first lord of the treasury on the precedent of lord north ’s not having done so but he quietly gave up his exchequer salary a fact that he did not publicize until the moment was ripe in a debate the following may
this was a point against lord grenville
he induced portland to accept cabinet office without portfolio before he died
he failed to persuade speaker abbot to become a secretary of state and after initial success failed to win over lord melville who was to have an earldom as compensation for being unfit for cabinet office which would go to his son
melville could not stomach perceval ’s apology we are no longer the sole representatives of mr pitt and while allowing his son to hold office outside the cabinet assumed that perceval preferred the saints to the scotch legion
but just as he opted for melvillites without melville and canningites without canning perceval wanted sidmouthites without sidmouth and the latter was equally outraged
nor would lord hardwicke allow his half brother charles yorke to serve
the difficulties of forming his administration were best illustrated by his having finally to be his own chancellor of the exchequer huskisson had gone out with canning and vansittart palmerston milnes rose and long all declined it in turn
similar difficulties occurred over minor offices
an administration which had only two cabinet ministers in the commons seemed to lack weight and was not expected to last but the king backed perceval and he was at least an effective head of government
nor did he face a united opposition lord malmesbury reported none of the great families have left them and indeed the generally prevailing sentiment thanks to the violence of the republicans of the higher classes is to support and stand by the king’.18perceval never called himself a tory
his principles he believed to be drawn from pitt ’s example and the chief issues of his administration to be the pursuit of the war against buonaparte in the face of defeatism and the balance of the constitution against radicalism
his first crucial test was the debate on the walcheren expedition which he had to justify in the session of january 1810
the violence of the opposition amendment to the address enabled him to carry it easily with the support of canning castlereagh and the saints but on 26 jan. the last two deserted him and he was defeated by nine votes on porchester ’s motion calling for an inquiry into the expedition
five days later he was three times defeated on the composition of the finance committee as well as suffering setbacks on bankes ’s reversion bill and horner ’s bullion motion
during the inquiry lord chatham ’s confidential report to the king was censured by the house on 23 feb. and 5 mar. whitbread and canning carried this point against government
perceval much as he deplored chatham ’s conduct felt obliged to stand by pitt ’s brother who at length reluctantly resigned office government breathed again
after such frequent defeats thought john william ward if anything could overturn a government supported by the king i should think that he must fall
on 30 mar. perceval won all the divisions on the conclusion of the inquiry though at the price of some concessions to canning ’s manoeuvres and his majority never rose above 51 in divisions of about 500 members.19 his onslaught against radicalism was concentrated on his brusque treatment of sir francis burdett he took advantage of the fears of the country gentlemen and induced thomas buckler lethbridge and sir robert salusbury to take the lead in the proceedings against burdett
perceval at length sent him to the tower but not without riot and confusion and the reluctant release of burdett ’s barabbas john gale jones
he subsequently resisted pressure for burdett ’s release and of course voted against parliamentary reform on brand ’s motion 21 may 1810
the burden of treasury business was familiar to perceval who had more or less assumed it in portland ’s administration
from 1807 to 1809 assisted by the financial secretary huskisson and by harrison the permanent assistant secretary he conscientiously overhauled as many departments as his moral urge to provide an efficient and less expensive administration dictated
retrenchment was in any case the only alternative to increased taxation
in 1808 he budgeted for a small increase in taxes and the overhaul of tax collection and a sturdy line with the bank of england which was induced to lessen its profits reduced the fiscal burden
favourable loan terms were also insisted on in succeeding years and exchequer bills funded annually usually to the amount of less than half the value of the loan
even so the mounting expenses of the war threatened to undermine treasury control
on the eve of his resignation in 1809 huskisson had warned him that such expenditure could not go on but perceval refused to hamper war supplies much as they always lagged behind demand especially in the peninsula
a new plan of finance seemed called for but he noted the unpopularity of that introduced by lord henry petty in 1807 and although he thought of raiding pitt ’s sinking fund and redeeming the wartime taxes every two years by additional taxes he found it impossible to stabilize the annual loan so he dropped such schemes in favour of annual adjustments.20 more optimistic than the financial experts his final answer was always that the war against buonaparte was the compelling factor
when the depreciation of paper currency and shortage of specie led to the whig inspired bullion committee in 1810 he resisted their conclusions which were not debated until may 1811 precisely because to act on them would hinder the war effort and he defiantly followed this up with a bill to make paper currency legal tender
perceval ’s somewhat reluctant attempts to strengthen his cabinet in the spring of 1810 were unavailing when lord melville ’s son resigned for his father ’s sake in april he was thereupon tempted to make a bid for sidmouth castlereagh and canning and form an administration which would comprehend the several persons who had at any time been connected with mr pitt
but sidmouth refused to serve with canning canning prevaricated and castlereagh was not even asked as the plan was for all three to be enlisted
therefore perceval merely reshuffled gaining charles yorke and regaining robert saunders dundas
canning urged his friend lord wellesley to put pressure on perceval for his inclusion in june but sidmouth still objected
perceval would not consider wellesley ’s making way for canning alone but in july obtained cabinet approval for wellesley ’s suggestion of a joint approach to canning and castlereagh the latter refusing canning was again frustrated
nor could he tempt perceval by offering him huskisson as chancellor of the exchequer for perceval was averse to huskisson ’s theories.21the failure of the negotiations of 1810 to strengthen the government was followed by a critical blow to its stability when its chief support the king became insane
perceval sought to obviate the problem by adjournment after adjournment making himself king for another fortnight but the house became restless and on 13 dec. 1810 he proposed to revive the statutory restrictions on regency enacted by pitt in 1788 though for a year only
opposition played into his hands by proposing an address to the prince of wales to assume the regency as of right and the prince and his brothers also rebelled against the restrictions
perceval defended his line with spirited eloquence and of the five resolutions in the regency bill introduced by him on 31 dec. all were carried by small majorities except the last giving the queen the presidency of the regency council which was rejected by 13 votes including those of canning castlereagh and wilberforce
perceval tried and failed by three votes to redeem this defeat a day later
in the lords there was then no difficulty as lord grenville deserted the whigs though he as auditor of the exchequer had made it impossible for perceval to raise supplies by sign manual by withholding the authorization to use it so that he had to resort to parliamentary authority to proceed by treasury warrant
on 17 jan. 1811 he thwarted with manifest superiority an opposition bid endorsed by the lords to restrict the regency to six months instead of a year
robert ward reported that since i have been in parliament i scarce ever heard such determined cheering as followed perceval
the prince ’s friends were instructed to vote against him and he contemplated resigning but fought gamely and saw the regency bill through on 29 jan. nothing came of speculations about a change of ministry and on 4 feb. the prince gave up the whigs and confirmed perceval in office though in a cold manner which suggested that the sudden prospect of the king ’s recovery was his chief anxiety
it was reported that perceval who had seen the king and continued to obtain his approbation of the regency proceedings knew that the prince could not endure him and laughed at his discomfiture
whitbread having previously found perceval as bold as brass now found him as saucy as a bantam cock’.22
a breach seemed inevitable especially when the prince unsuccessfully pressed him for places for his friends
perceval had also prevented opposition from making capital of irish bids for catholic relief on the basis of a veto on episcopal appointments 25 may 1810
under the nom de plume of ab he wrote six letters on the subject of dr milner ’s explanation to the morning post which carried fire into the enemy camp but his main problem was to prevent the irish government from going too far in its efforts to prevent the catholics from convening february 1811
to his surprise the regent acquiesced in opposing a catholic convention and perceval was able to maintain his authority over the hard liners at dublin castle
in the course of the session of 1811 perceval went from strength to strength
the country can never be under the direction of a more honourable and virtuous man according to the formerly critical lord malmesbury
liverpool informed wellington his character is completely established in the house of commons he has acquired an authority there beyond any minister in my recollection except mr pitt
not only the country gentlemen and the city but the more magnanimous members of opposition admired him and the regent neglected his whig friends in perceval ’s favour although it was now unlikely that the king would recover
perceval had the additional gratification of seeing the peninsular war which he had never ceased to defend against despondent critics at home begin to go well and of reinstating the duke of york as commander in chief of the army in may 1811 without any anxiety about his majority in the house
if the expiry of the regency restrictions hung over him like a sentence as hard as iron he survived that too
the regent failed to induce him to accept his grandiose schemes for the king ’s household or an additional £ 50,000 a year to his regency grant but insisted against perceval ’s advice on inviting lords grey and grenville to come to terms with government
their refusal on 15 feb. 1812 confirmed perceval in office which the king in a lucid moment endorsed
john william ward had observed if the regent changes the government he must turn out the most popular man in england which perceval undoubtedly is and break with all that party which has supported his father during the whole of his long reign
in short he must be horribly embarrassed
lord wellesley was thwarted in his wish to displace perceval by superior influence at carlton house to further which he offered his resignation on the grounds of being unable to serve under perceval who was to have been forced to put on the big wig
wellesley found his exodus accepted all too readily by the cabinet and the regent and as perceval had intended castlereagh stepped into the foreign office while sidmouth an ally on the catholic question was also introduced into the cabinet with his friend lord buckinghamshire and with provision for more of his friends on the cards
the regent ’s favour had ensured the strengthening of perceval ’s administration and when asked why he did not dissolve parliament in march 1812 perceval replied why make well better
.23the last act of perceval ’s government was to give reluctant consent to a committee of inquiry into the orders in council
their relaxation to prevent war with the united states was a matter for negotiation in the winter of 1811 12 when the luddite riots broke out at home were severely dealt with and provided opposition with a lever for agitating the question
government at first resisted inquiry 3 mar. 1812 but yielded in the face of a petitioning campaign
perceval still defended the orders despite their unpopularity
the committee was at work when perceval was to quote his own last word murdered by the maniacal gunshot of john bellingham as talking and laughing he entered the lobby of the house 11 may 1812
a politically motivated assassination was at once suspected and the mob seemed inclined to make a hero of bellingham but he was not their man being by his own confession neither fit for this world nor for the next
the convulsive sob with which perceval died moved the house next day to vote £ 2,000 p.a
for jane perceval and £ 50,000 for their children to be known in the family as the blood money’.24making due allowance for the apotheosis which attended a fate unique in the annals of the british premiership perceval was at his death the most outstanding politician in the house a cunning lawyer and a very frank man he had an admirable way of placing the subject which he is discussing in the best point of view
but he suffered from a reserve as to his intentions and a tendency to concession and half measures which was doubtless due to a want of decision occasioned by his honourable anxiety never to do wrong
that was why lord mulgrave thought he only wanted something more of the devil to be a very good premier
he never confided in his colleagues except perhaps the ryders and conducted his own defence he did not readily cultivate supporters and relied on his character and eloquence for he was prepared to speak until his subject was exhausted and to claim the force majeure of mr pitt ’s brief to command assent in parliament
still as lord palmerston commented it is a great thing when even the bitterest opponents of a minister dare not to impeach his integrity and honour
personally incorruptible he was not eager to reward his family or friends and had no notion of calculating support by favours
charles williams wynn thought that had he lived he would have been driven out of office before the end of the session and perceval himself was distinctly reported to be ready to resign if defeated on canning ’s imminent motion on behalf of the catholics though canning believed he would dissolve parliament in the face of it
once formed his convictions were fixed and his differing from pitt on this issue did not shake him though grattan was reported in may 1812 to have been saying these three years that perceval would in the end emancipate the catholics
one english catholic observed mr perceval was indeed against our emancipation from private prejudice but i believe he was otherways a very honest and able minister’.25the fact was that perceval an enthusiast in whatever he undertakes was that rare bird among english premiers a stickler for the church of england as by law established
from 1803 until his death he sought in vain to impose residence on the clergy or adequate payment of their curates by legislation
he wished to purify and expand the national church and supported all its institutions
he submitted his cause to his god
remarking on the confident face with which he met the world without sufficient strength to carry him through at the outset of his ministry tierney added but on what it is that he relies i can not comprehend
he did not know of the daily prayers offered up by perceval to sanctify his office
chosen prime minister during a crisis in all his insecurity he never had far to fall and his weakness was more apparent to others than to himself
he was moreover fertile in expedients to maintain his position and as resilient as punch as whitbread once amused the house by remarking
in fact despite his nolo episcopari of 1809 he had no intention of resigning office to any other candidate thereafter
wellesley pole wrote 28 apr. 1810 perceval does not seem to have an idea that any change in his situation could make it more easy to form a strong administration i do suppose no person could be found to tell him this though certainly almost everybody thinks it
more receptive than his colleagues to the ideas of the saints whose reign he was supposed to have inaugurated he resisted their pressure to go further than his survival as a minister permitted his motto was ubi plura nitent non ego paucis offendar maculis
john william ward concluded that there was nothing to object to in him besides his opinions
his talents were admirable and if he had not been a lawyer he would probably have risen to the character of a great man
he wanted mr pitt ’s splendid declamatory eloquence but in quickness and dexterity as a debater he was i think hardly inferior to him
on the whole he appeared to me the most powerful man independently of his situation that we had in parliament since the death of mr fox
nothing could be so gentlemanlike and fair as his management of the house of commons
indeed i do not believe that in the height of his prosperity he ever showed the least mark of insolence
the speaker however complained in retrospect that he was not desirous of holding high either its credit or its authority’.26ref volumes 1790 1820author r. g. thorne notesbased on d. gray s. perceval the evangelical prime minister 1962 the perceval holland mss penes mr david holland and other perceval mss in the bl many of perceval ’s letters were published by s. walpole in s. perceval 2 vols 1874 but with alterations and omissions so the original mss have been preferred
