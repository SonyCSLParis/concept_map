william smith esq
q.
you are a member in the present commons house of parliament a. yes
on the 11th of this month last monday
i was going through the lobby towards the door of the house of commons
as i was passing through the lobby i stopped to speak to a gentleman whom i met with there while in conversation with that gentleman i heard the report of a pistol which appeared to have been fired close by the entrance of the door of the lobby
q.
by that door do you mean the door by which members coming from their residences get into the house a. yes the first door of the lobby
this appeared to have been fired from that door immediately upon hearing the report i turned my head towards the place from whence the noise appeared to have proceeded and observed a tumult and probably a dozen or more persons gathering about the spot almost at the same instant a person rushed hastily from among the crowd and several voices cried out shut the door and let no one escape
the person who came from among the crowd came towards me looking first one way and then another and as i thought at the moment rather like one seeking for shelter than as the person who had received the wound but taking two or three steps towards me as he approached he rather reeled by me and almost instantly fell upon the floor with his face downwards
before he fell i heard a cry not very distinctly what appeared to come from him in which were the words murder or something very much like that
when he first fell i thought he might be slightly wounded and expected to see him make an effort to rise but gazing at him a few moments i observed that he did not stir at all i therefore immediately stooped down to raise him from the ground requesting the assistance of a gentleman who stood close by me for that purpose
as soon as we had turned his face towards us and not till then i perceived it was mr. perceval
we then took him in our arms the other gentleman on his left side and i on his right
we carried him into the office of the speaker 's secretary and ourselves on a table there with mr. perceval between us also sitting on the table resting in our at that time completely pale the small quantity from each corner of its month and as i then thought probably not more than two minutes had elapsed since the pistol had been fired there were not scarcely any signs of life remaining his eyes were still open
but he did not appear to know me nor take any notice of any person that came about him nor had he uttered the least articulate sound from the moment that he fell
a few convulsive sobs which lasted three or four minutes together with scarcely a perceptible pulse were the only signs of life remaining and this continued but for a short time longer and when i felt his wrist for the last time assisted by mr. lynn a surgeon who had arrived it appeared to me that he was totally dead i remained in the same situation with the body till we carried it into the speaker 's house
i am incapable of giving any account of whatever passed afterwards in the lobby respecting the detension or conduct of the prisoner at the bar
q. had you afterwards any opportunity of seeing where mr. perceval was wounded a. mr. perceval still remained on my arm when mr. lynn examined the wound he came into the room and examined the wound while we remained in the same posture
the body not having been moved at all i saw the wound from which but little blood appeared to have issued
q. where was the wound a.
the wound was very near the nipple of the left breast a little above it and within it the orifice appeared to me to be large for a pistol ball and when mr. lynn probed it it seemed clearly that the ball had slaunted downwards but it appeared clearly that the ball had penetrated the cavity of the breast for the probe did not touch it
q. mr. perceval i believe was a person of low stature a. unquestionably
q. state the hour of the day that this happened a. i recollect from various circumstances that it see original click to see originalmust have been between five o'clock and a quarter after
q. i know you have been long a member of that place is that about the time that mr. perceval in his public situation would come to the house a.
it is about the time that mr. perceval in his public situation would come and about that time he was constantly expected and nearer to that time than any other
q. was the gentleman that assisted of the name of phillips a. i believe it was
william lynn
q. i believe you are a surgeon residing in great george street westminster a. i am

q. what time in the afternoon a. about a quarter past five in the afternoon
q. what part of the house of commons or about it did you go to a. i went through the lobby into the passage to the speaker 's secretary 's room
q. when you got there what did you see a.
i saw mr. perceval lay partly upon the table with his feet in two chairs one foot on each chair i then saw some blood upon the white waistcoat and shirt i turned it aside and saw an opening in the skin i examined his pulse he had no pulsation and appeared quite dead
q. did you probe the wound a. i probed it the probe passed three inches obliquely downwards and inwards it being immediately over the heart about the further rib i had no doubt that the ball had passed into the heart if not through it
it was a large pistol ball apparently
q. could you from the appearance judge sir that that was the cause of his death a. i have no doubt of that
henry burgess
q.
you are a solicitor a. i am

q. a little after five o'clock did you hear the report of a pistol a. i did
q. from what part of the lobby did that report proceed from a. from the entrance
q.
what did you observe next after the report of the pistol a. i saw a person coming forwards along the lobby from the entrance towards the house staggering and just before he came to the pillars next the door i saw him put his hand to his breast or nigh his breast he said oh faintly and fell forwards on his face i heard some people say that is the man and i saw a man pointing towards a bench by the side of the fire place at the side of the lobby
i immediately at the same instant went to the bench i saw the prisoner sitting on the bench in great agitation i looked at both hands and saw his left hand on the bench and in his hand or under his hand i saw the pistol i immediately took the pistol in my hand and asked him what could have induced him to do such a thing or act he replied want of redress of grievance and refusal by government it was to that effect i do not say these were the exact words i said you have another pistol in your pocket he replied yes i asked him if it was loaded he said yes i saw some person take it from the left side of the prisoner 's person about the coat or breeches
q. when you took hold of the first pistol which you found in his hand or under his hand in what condition was it a.
it was warm it had the appearance of having been recently discharged i have the pistol here this is it
q. is it a large or a small bore to the pistol a.
i thought it was a very large bore
when he told me that the other pistol was loaded i immediately put my hand into his right waistcoat pocket and took out a pen knife and a pencil and a bunch of keys and some money at the same time i saw the pistol taken from him and a bundle of papers

q. did you before the magistrate in the presence of the prisoner relate the facts which you have today related a.
i did
q. when you had concluded your narrative did he make any observation up it a.
he did he said as nigh as i can recollect i wish to correct mr. burgess 's statement in one part but i believe he is perfectly correct in any other instead of my hand as mr. burgess has stated being on or near the pistol i think he took it from my hand or out of my hand i do not know whether he said from my hand or out of my hand
q. did he make any other observation upon your evidence a.
he did not
mr. alley
i take it for granted you have stated every thing that occurred a. no i can not recollect every thing that he stated i have recollected every thing of importance
q.
he said he had been ill used and when you asked him why he did it that is the reason he gave you mere want of redress of grievance on the part of government a. redress of grievance and a refusal by government
q. that is all he said to you a. no he said i will relate to you why i did it
q.
and when you asked him why he did it that is the reason he gave you a.
that is nearly the reason
q.
he did not state any personal resentment to mr. perceval a.
he did not
q. there were a great many persons in the lobby a. not a great many not more than twenty
q. do you mean at the time the pistol was fired a. i do
i do not think there were twenty at the time the pistol was fired
q. there was an order given to shut the door of the lobby had that order been given before or after your conversation a. i will not pretend to say i heard the order given
q.
you say the man was very much agitated a. very much
q. might not he have absconded after he had fired the pistol before the door had been ordered to be shut a. i will not say
mr. gurney
how long did that agitation continue a. he was extremely agitated the whole time see original click to see originali was with him afterwards up stairs he appeared perfectly calm and collected
q. with respect to the possibility of escape from the firing of the pistol must the prisoner have been within the lobby or without a. i do n't know i should suppose there is no doubt he was in the lobby i have no doubt he was in the lobby in my own mind
q. i believe down three steps from the door of the lobby there is an officer stationed a. two steps from the lobby
q.
and then four or five steps down there is an officer a. there are persons belonging to the house stationed
q.
at the bottom of these four steps there are two persons stationed are there not a. i generally see one sometimes there are two i generally see one
q. could any person go out of the lobby without going close by that person a.
he must have gone within a yard of him or less
lieutenant general isaac gascoyne
q. i believe you are a member of the house of commons a. i am
q. were you in one of the committee rooms in the afternoon of monday last the 11th inst a. about five o'clock on monday last i went to the house with a petition to let mr. perceval see it by his own desire previous to that petition being presented to the house
before five o'clock the house resolved itself into a committee of the whole house to proceed further respecting the order of council
mr. perceval then not being come down to the house i postponed till his arrival presenting that petition and went up stairs into the committee room close by the ballustrades which look down into the lobby the door open towards that ballustrade it was merely the same thing as to hearing as to being in the lobby of the house
i heard the loud report of a pistol shot and almost instantaneously the cry of close the door
i rushed down stairs through the house into the lobby the door facing of the ballustrade was open
the moment i came into the lobby i saw a crowd collected about some individual whom i could not see and to whom the attention of almost every person was directed i mean the generality a person near me whom i should not know if i were to see him immediately said that is the man that fired the pistol pointing to john bellingham who stands there whose person i well knew and whose name i was acquainted with i flew towards him he was then sitting with one or two others upon the bench at the right hand side of the fire place of the lobby supposing your back turned towards that fire
q. between the fire place and the entrance door of the lobby a.
just so
i seized him by the breast i think and as he lifted up his hand it appeared to me that a pistol was in that hand either cocked or upon the half cock it appeared to me cocked
the the first impression in my mind was that it was to be used against himself
i saw the pistol in his hand grasped i therefore kept down his arm with all my strength and a person whom i believe to be the last witness mr. burgess whom i then did not know took that pistol from under his hand his hand being so held that there was little or no resistance from him
i heard that person ask him whether he had another pistol i heard his reply that he had i proceeded to search for it there were then others searching him
i put my hand into his coat pocket i think one of the inside pockets i had my hand in several of his pockets i pulled out a bundle of papers tied together with red tape the pressure was great at that moment i found myself closely pressed at that time i was fearful of losing these papers and of losing the prisoner
i held up the papers and mr. hume a member of the house of commons took the papers out of my hand with my consent it appeared to me at that time as it were the prisoner was dragged from my hold i have no doubt now but it was the effect of persons to secure him at that time i thought it was to drag him out of the lobby
i fastened both my hands upon him told him he could not escape that i knew him well and that i would not lose sight of him he said he had submitted as if it were not to use him ill i believe he rather complained of my using his arm rather roughly he said that he had submitted that he was the person that fired the shot some other questions were asked but i can not now distinctly speak to them nor to the answers but with the assistance of other she was dragged into the body of the house and placed at the bar in the custody of the two messengers
i mentioned to him his name which he admitted
q. from the body of the house he was taken to another place where he and you were examined a. yes
q.
you were examined and that examination took place in his presence a.
it did
q. after you had made your deposition did the prisoner make any remark upon it a. something to this effect general gascoyne is too correct for me to question what he has said
he must have been less agitated than i was he complained of the violence to his arm
q. when you first laid hold of him did he appear to be in a state of agitation a.
he certainly appeared to be in a state of agitation as any man would be guilty of a crime in a perspiration
q. did he appear to have recovered from that agitation after your deposition was over a. completely composed as i had known him before this occurrence happened
q.
you stated that you knew him how lately before had you seen him a.

q. how soon after you had passed that door where the prisoner was that you described did you hear any noise a. almost as soon as i got on the top of the stairs that leads to the gallery for strangers there is a sort of an anti lobby as you pass part of that gallery there i had just got into the upper lobby

prisoner 's defence
i feel great personal obligations to the learned attorney general for the objections that he made to the defence set up by my counsel on account of insanity it is far more fortunate for me that such a plea as that should be unfounded and at the same time i am under the same obligation to my learned counsels for their zeal in my defence in setting up the plea that i am insane by the desire of my friends or that i have been insane
i am not apprised of a single instance in russia where my insanity was made public except in one single instance when the pressure of my sufferings had exposed me to that imputation
gentlemen i beg pardon
this is the first time i ever was in public in this kind of way and you i am sure will look at the substance of what i say more than the manner of my offering it
gentlemen as to the lamentable catastrophe for which i am now on my trial before this court if i am the man that i am supposed to be to go and deliberately shoot mr. perceval without malice i should consider myself a monster and not fit to live in this world or the next
the learned attorney general has candidly stated to you that till this fatal time of this catastrophe which i heartily regret no man more so not even one of the family of mr. perceval
i had no personal or premeditated malice towards that gentleman the unfortunate lot had fallen upon him as the leading member of that administration which had repeatedly refused me any reparation for the unparalled injuries i had sustained in russia for eight years with the cognizance and sanction of the minister of the country at the court of st. petersburg
gentlemen i must begin to explain the origin of see original click to see originalthis unhappy affair which took place in 1804
i was a merchant at liverpool in that year i went to russia on some mercantile business of importance to myself and having finished that business i was about to take my departure from archangel for england at that time a ship called the soleure was lost in the white sea she was chartered for england and by the direction of her owners insured at lloyd 's coffee house but the underwriters at lloyd 's refused to pay the owners for their loss
in consequence of some circumstances connected with this refusal and the loss of the ship they cast their suspicions at me at the same time i had no concern in it whatever i was about leaving the place they writ up to lloyd 's coffee house who had given the communication i was seized as i was passing the russian frontier by order of the military governor of archangel and thrown into prison i immediately aplied to the british consul at archangel and through him to the british ambassador lord granville leveson gower then at the russian court stating my case
lord gower wrote to the military governor of archangel desiring that if i was not detained for any legal cause i might be liberated as a british subject but the governor answered that i was detained in prison for a legal cause and that i had conducted myself in a very indecorous manner
from this time lord gower and the british consul positively declined any further interference in the business and i was detained in durance for near two years in spite of all my endeavours to induce the british minister to interfere with the emperor of russia for an investigation of my case
at length however after being banded from prison to prison and from dungeon to dungeon fed on bread and water treated with the utmost cruelty and frequently marched through the streets under a military guard with felons and criminals of the most atrocious description even before the residence of the british minister who might view from his window this degrading severity towards a british subject who had committed no crime to the disgrace and insult of the british nation
i was afterwards enabled to make my case known through the procureur it was investigated and he obtained a judgment against the military governour and the senate
notwithstanding this decision i was immediately sent to another prison and a demand was made on me for two thousand rubles alledged to be due by me to a russian merchant who was a bankrupt
i refused to pay this demand for a debt which i did not owe and the senate finding me determined to resist the demand i was declared a bankrupt and continued in prison under the pretence i had made answer that i could not pay it because all my property was in england
no such answer was ever given by me under this pretence i was detained in prison
gentlemen it is a custom in russia that if a foreigner is declared a bankrupt three months are allowed for all his creditors in russia to make their claims and eighteen months more for creditors resident in other parts of the world but notwithstanding that the three months had elapsed and not a single claimant appeared although the senate sent forth their clerks to enquire of all strangers who arrived whether they had any demands against me
still i was detained in prison and sent from gaol to gaol and i was finally handed over to the college of commerce the two thousand rubles were still demanded of me and lord gower refused to interfere in the business and the consul told me i must pay the money
i was not destitute of the means of payment but i resisted the claim on account of its gross injustice
when the marquis of douglas arrived in russia i made my case known to him and said i only wished it to be shewn that the money was justly due and i would pay it
the marquis of douglas made a representation and stated that it was only desired that the justice of the claim should be shewn and the money should be paid this application was ineffectual and i was still required to pay the two thousand rubles or even twenty rubles to acknowledge in some degree the justice of the demand but i was aware if i had done this i should justify the conduct of the senate and the military governour of archangel against whom i had obtained a legal decision with an acknowledgement that i had been unjustly treated
the necessary consequence would be that for my supposed contumacy in bringing a false charge against the senate and governor i should be sent to siberia i persisted in refusing to comply with the claims
gentlemen all this while my wife a young woman of only twenty years of age with an infant at her breast remained at st. petersburg in expectation of my arrival and at length in the eighth month of her pregnancy disappointed of her hopes was obliged to set out unprotected on her voyage to england
at last after a series of six years persesution in the manner i have described and after the repeated refusal of lord gower and the british consul to represent my case to the emperor a circumstance occurred which proved in a more particular degree the peculiar negligence which i had experienced
a captain gardiner of a hull ship arrived at archangel he had a little squabble with the commander of a guard ship about a demand of a few rubles for pilotage and yet this man 's complaint was represented to the emperor four times within a month by the british ambassador while for a series of six years unparalleled persecution i was not able to obtain any interference on my behalf
at length the senate quite tired out by these severities in 1809 i received at midnight a discharge from my confinement with a pass and an order to quit the russian dominions which was in fact an acknowledgment of the justice of my cause
on my return in england i laid a statement of my grievances before the marquis wellesley accompanied by authentic documents and claiming some redress for the injuries i had sustained through the british minister in russia which injuries it was impossible i should have suffered if they had not been sanctioned by that minister
the noble marquis is now in court and could contradict my statement if false but i represent the circumstances as they really were and not as personally concerning myself but as involving the honour of the british government i was referred by the marquis to the privy council and from the privy council to the treasury and thus baffled from one party to another see original click to see originali applied to mr. perceval during the session 1811 but received for answer from his secretary that the time for presenting private petitions was gone by and that mr. perceval could not encourage my hopes that he would recommend my claims to the house of commons
i next memorialized his royal highness the prince regent with a statement of my sufferings
here the prisoner read a petition to the prince regent
foreign office january 31 1810
sir i am directed by the marquis wellesley to transmit to you the papers which you sent to this office accompanied with your letter of the 27th of last month and i am to inform you that his majesty 's government is precluded from interfering in the support of your cause in some measure by the circumstances of the case itself and entirely so at the present moment by the suspension of intercourse with the court of st. petersburgh
 council office whitehall may 16 1810
mr. john bellingham sir i am directed by the lords of the council to acquaint you that their lordships have taken into consideration your petition on the subject of your arrest in russia do not find that it is a matter in which their lordship 's can interfere
i am sir your most obedient humble servant w. fawkener

i am sir your most obedient servant j. beckett
 some time afterwards i received an answer from colonel m'mahon stating that by some accident my petition was mislaid
i then wrote another petitition to his royal highness and i understood it was referred to the treasury as appeared by a letter i received from mr. ryder at whitehall
gentlemen under these circumstances i was plunged into ruin and involved in debt and the learned attorney general has admitted there was not a spot on my character until this fatal catastrophe which when i reflect on it i could burst into a flood of tears
i was totally refused any redress
gentlemen what would be your feelings what would be your alternative as the affair was national and as his majesty 's ministers recommended me backwards and forwards from one to another
i wrote another petition to his royal highness but was informed by a letter from mr. ryder that his royal highness had not been pleased to give any commands on the subject gentlemen 
as my petition was of a pecuniary nature i was informed by general gascoyne that it was impossible to come into the house without the consent of one of his majesty 's ministers for which i thank general gascoyne for his politeness in giving me that information and as i was very well known in liverpool i could have got the signatures of the whole town
i began to flatter myself i should get redress but instead of redress his majesty 's ministers and the chancellor of the exchequer told me i was not to expect any thing
i was obliged to give notice about six week since to the magistrates at the public office bow street in a letter stating my grievances intreating their interference by application to government and adding that if all redress was refused me i must be obliged to do myself justice by taking such steps as those must be responsible for who resisted all my applications
here the prisoner read a letter to mr. read of bow street
to their worships the police magistrates of the public office bow street
sirs i much regret it being my lot to apply to your worships under most peculiar and novel circumstances for the particulars of the case i refer you to the enclosed letter from mr. secretary ryder the notification from mr. perceval and my petition parliament together with the printed papers herewith
the affair requires no further remark than that i consider his majesty 's government to have completely closed the door of justice in declining to have or even permit my grievances to be brought before parliament for redress which privilege is the birth right of every individual
the purport of the present is therefore once more to solicit his majesty 's ministers through your medium to let what is right and proper be done in my instance which is all i require
should this reasonable request be finally denied i shall then feel myself justified in executing justice myself in which case i shall be ready to argue the merits of so reluctant a measure with his majesty 's attorney general wherever and whenever i may be called upon so to do in the hopes of averting so abhorrent but compulsive an alternative i have the honour to be sirs your very humble and obedient servant

sir i am directed by mr. secretary ryder to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant requesting to be informed in what stage your claim on his majesty 's government for criminal detention in russia now is
in reply i am to refer you to my several letters of the 18th of february 9th and 20th of march by which you have been already informed that your first petition to his royal highness the prince regent praying for remuneration had been refered to the lords of the council that upon your second memorial praying his royal highness to give orders that the subject should be brought before parliament his royal highness has not been pleased to signify any commands and lastly in answer to your application to mr. ryder requesting permission on the part of his majesty 's ministers to present your petition to the house of commons you were informed that your application should be addressed to the right honourable the chancellor of the exchequer
i am sir your most obedient humble servant j. beckitt
 see original click to see originali received an answer from mr. justice read saying that the office could not interfere
but i found that mr. read as was his duty had represented the circumstance to government and on a subsequent application to the treasury i was informed that i had nothing to expect and that i was at liberty to take such steps as i thought fit
finding myself thus bereft of all hopes of redress my affairs ruined by my long imprisonment in russia through the fault of the british minister my property all dispersed for want of my own attention my family driven into tribulation and want my wife and child claiming support which i was unable to give them myself involved in difficulties and pressed on all sides by claims i could not answer and that justice refused to me which is the duty of government to give not as a matter of favour but of right and mr. perceval obstinately refusing to sanction my claims in parliament and i trust this fatal catastrophe will be warning to other ministers
if they had listened to my case this court would not have been engaged in this case but mr. perceval obstinately refusing to sanction my claim in parliament i was driven to despair and under these agonizing feelings i was impelled to that desperate alternative which i unfortunately adopted
my arm was the instrument that shot mr. perceval but gentlemen ought i not to be redressed instead of that mr. ryder referred me to the treasury and after several weeks the treasury sent me to the secretary of state 's office mr. hill informed me that it would be useless to apply to government any more mr. beckitt added mr. perceval has been consulted he would not let my petition come forward
gentlemen a refusal of justice was the sole cause of this fatal catastrophe his majesty 's ministers have now to reflect upon their conduct for what has happened
lord gower is now in court i call on him to contradict if he can the statement i have made and gentlemen if he does not i hope you will then take my statement to be correct
mr. perceval has unfortunately fallen the victim of my desperate resolution
no man i am sure laments the calamitous event more than i do
if i had met lord gower he would have received the ball and not mr. perceval
as to death if it were to be suffered five hundred times i should prefer it to the injuries and indignities which i have experienced in russia i should consider it as the wearied traveller does the inn which affords him an asylum for repose but government in the injustice they have done me were infinitely more criminal than the wretch who for depriving the traveller of a few shillings on the highway forfeits his life to the law
what is the comparison of this man 's offence to government or gentlemen what is my crime to the crime of government itself
it is no more than a mite to a mountain unless it was proved that i had malice propense towards the unfortunate gentleman for whose death i am now upon my trial
i disclaim all personal or intentional malice against mr. perceval

when mr. smith came to us he told mr. bellingham that if he had not known that he had ladies with him he would not have come at all mr. bellingham then told him the reason he had brought us that it was to convince us that his claim was just and that he should very soon have the money

lord chief justice mansfield
gentlemen of the jury you are now to try an indictment which charges the prisoner at the bar with the wilful murder here the learned judge was so hurt by his feelings that he could not proceed for several seconds of mr. spencer perceval in a faint voice who was murdered with a pistol loaded with a bullet when he mentioned the name of here again his lordship was sincerely affected and burst into tears in which he was joined by the greatest portion of the persons in court a man so dear and so revered as that of mr. spencer perceval i find it difficult to suppress my feelings
as however to say any thing of the distinguished talents and virtues of that excellent man might tend to excite improper emotions in the minds of the jury but would with hold these feelings which pressed for utterance from my heart and leave you gentlemen to form your judgment upon the evidence which has been adduced in support of the case undressed by any unfair indignation which you might feel against his murderer by any description however faint of the excellent qualities of the deceased
gentlemen you are to try the unfortunate man at the bar in the same manner as if he was arraigned for the murder of any other man
the law protected all his majesty 's subjects alike and the crime was the same whether committed upon the person of the highest and most distinguished character in the country as upon that of the lowest
the only question you have to try is whether the prisoner did wilfully and maliciously murder mr. spencer perceval or not
it is not necessary to go very minutely into the evidence which has been produced to the fact as there is little doubt as to the main object of your enquiry
the first thing you have to say is whether the person charged with having murdered him and whether that murder had been committed with a pistol bullet
the learned judge see original click to see originalthen proceeded to read the testimony given by the several witnesses examined
that of mr. smith surgeon lynn and mr. burgess clearly substantiated the fact that the deceased had died in consequence of a pistol shot which had been discharged into his breast and that the hand of the prisoner was the hand which had discharged that weapon
with respect to the deliberation that had been proved by other witnesses and from what i could collect from the prisoner 's defence it seems to amount to a conclusion that he conceived himself justified in what he had done by his majesty 's government having refused to redress some supposed grievances
such dreadful reasoning could not be too strongly reprobated
if a man fancied he was right and in consequence conceived that that fancy was not gratified he had a right to obtain justice by any means which his physical strength gave him there is no knowing where so pernicious a doctrine might end
if a man fancies he has a right and endeavours to assert that right is he to put to death the persons who refuses to give him any reparation to that which he supposes himself entitled
by the same reason every person who presided in a court of judicature refusing to give to a suitor in an action what he requires would be liable to revenge equally atrocious
in another part of the prisoner 's defence which was not however urged by himself it was attempted to be proved that at the time of the commission of the crime he was insane
with respect to this the law was extremely clear if a man was deprived of all power of reasoning so as not to be able to distinguish whether it was right or wrong to commit the most wicked or the most innocent transaction he could not certainly commit an act against the law such a man so destitute of all power of judgment could have no intention at all
in order to support this defence it ought to be proved by the most distinct and unquestionable evidence that the criminal was incapable of judging between right or wrong
there was no other proof of insanity which would excuse murder or any other crime
there are various species of insanity
some human creatures are void of all power of reasoning from their birth such could not be guilty of any crime
these is another species of madness in which persons were subject to temporary paroxysms in which they were guilty of acts of extravagance this was called lunacy if these persons committed a crime when they were not affected with the malady they were to all intents and purposes ameniable to justice so long as they can distinguish good from evil so long are they answerable for their conduct
there is a third species of insanity in which the patient fancied the existence of injury and sought an opportunity of gratifying revenge by some hostile act if such a person was capable in other respects of distinguishing right from wrong there is no excuse for any act of atrocity which he might commit under this description of derangement
the witnesses who had been called to support this extraordinary defence had given a very singular account to shew that at the commission of the crime the prisoner was insane
what might have been the state of his mind some time ago was perfectly immaterial
the single question is whether at the time this fact was committed he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil right from wrong and whether murder was a crime not only against the law of god but against the law of his country
here it appears that the prisoner had gone out like another man that he came up to london by himself at christmas last that he was under no restraint that no medical man had attended him to cure his malady that he was perfectly regular in all his habits in short there was no proof adduced to shew that his understanding was so deranged as not to enable him to know that murder was a crime
on the contrary the testimony adduced in his defence has most distinctly proved from a description of his general demeanour that he was in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions
having then commented on the evidence of mrs. clarke mrs. billett and mary figgins his lordship concluded by advising the jury to take all the facts into their most serious consideration
if you have any doubt you will give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt but if you conceive him guilty of the crime alledged against him in that case you will find him guilty
the jury after a consultation of two minutes and a half in the box expressed a wish to retire and an officer of the court being sworn accompanied them to the jury room
as they passed out the prisoner regarded them separately with a look of mingled confidence and complacency
they were absent fourteen minutes and on their return into court their countenances acting as indices to their minds at once unfolded the determination for which they had come
the prisoner again directed his attention to them in the same manner as before
the names being called over and the verdict being asked for in the usual form the foreman announced the fatal decission of guilty upon the indictment for murder and upon the coroner 's inquisition
mr. shelton
q. to prisoner
john bellingham you stand convicted of the wilful murder of the right honourable spencer perceval what have you to say why the court should not give you judgment to die according to law
to this interrogatory the prisoner made no reply
the recorder passed sentence in a most solemn and affecting manner which was as follows -"prisoner at the bar
you have been convicted by a most attentive and a most merciful jury of one of the most malicious and atrocious crimes it is in the power of human nature to perpetrate that of wilful and premeditated murder
a crime which in all ages and in all nations has been held in the deepest detestation a crime as odious and abominable in the eyes of god as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man
a crime which although thus heinous in itself in your case has been heightened by every possible feature of aggravation
you have shed the blood of a man admired for every virtue which can adorn public or private life a man whose suavity and meekness of manner was calculated to disarm all political rancour and to deprive violence of its asperity
by his death charity has lost one of its greatest promoters religion one of its firmest supporters domestic society one of its happiest and sweetest examples and the country one of its brightest ornaments a man whose ability and worth was likely to produce lasting advantages to this see original click to see originalempire and ultimate benefit to the world
your crime has this additional feature of atrocious guilt that in the midst of civil society unarmed defenceless in the fulfilment of his public duty and within the very verge of the sanctuary of the law your impure hand has deprived of existence a man as universally beloved as preeminent for his talents and excellence of heart
to indulge in any conjecture as to the motive which could have led you to the commission of this atrocious deeds would be to enquire into all that is base and perfidious in the human heart
assassination is most horrid and revolting to the soul of man inasmuch as it is calculated to render bravery useless and cowardice successful
it is therefore that the voice of god himself has declared,"that he that sheddeth man 's blood by man shall his blood be shed
in conformity to these laws which god hath ordained and men have obeyed your disgraced and indignant country by the example of your ignominious fate will appreciate the horror of your offence and set up a warning to all others who might hereafter be tempted to the perpetration of a crime of so deep a dye
a short time a very short time remains for you to supplicate for that mercy in another world which public justice forbids you to expect in this
sincerely do i hope that the short interval that has elapsed since the commission of this atrocious offence has not been unemployed by you in soliciting that pardon from the almighty which i trust your prayers may obtain through the merits of your redeemer whose first attribute is mercy
it only now remains for me to pass the dreadful sentence of the law which is -"that you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came and from thence to a place of execution where you shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead your body to be dissected and anatomized
