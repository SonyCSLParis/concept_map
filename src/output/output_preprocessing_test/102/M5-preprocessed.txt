the hasmonean dynasty[2 was the ruling dynasty of judea and surrounding regions during classical antiquity
between c. 140 and c. 116 bc the dynasty ruled semi autonomously from the seleucids in the region of judea
from 110 bc with the seleucid empire disintegrating the dynasty became fully independent expanded into the neighbouring regions of samaria galilee iturea perea and idumea and took the title basileus
some modern scholars refer to this period as an independent kingdom of israel
3 in 63 bc the kingdom was conquered by the roman republic broken up and set up as a roman client state
the kingdom had survived for 103 years before yielding to the herodian dynasty in 37 bc
even then herod the great tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a hasmonean princess mariamne and planning to drown the last male hasmonean heir at his jericho palace
the dynasty was established under the leadership of simon maccabaeus two decades after his brother judas the maccabee 
y'hudhah ha makabi defeated the seleucid army during the maccabean revolt
according to historical sources including 1 maccabees and 2 maccabees and the first book of the jewish war by jewish historian flavius josephus ad 37 c. 100),[4 after antiochus iv 's successful invasion of ptolemaic egypt was turned back by the intervention of the roman republic,[5][6
antiochus instead moved to assert strict control over the seleucid satrapy of coele syria and phoenicia,[7 sacking jerusalem and its temple suppressing jewish and samaritan religious and cultural observances,[7 and imposing hellenistic practices
the ensuing revolt by the jews 167 bc began a twenty five year period of jewish independence potentiated by the steady collapse of the seleucid empire under attacks from the rising powers of the roman republic and the parthian empire
however the same power vacuum that enabled the jewish state to be recognized by the roman senate c. 139 bc was later exploited by the romans themselves
hyrcanus ii and aristobulus ii simon 's great grandsons became pawns in a proxy war between julius caesar and pompey the great
the deaths of pompey 48 bc caesar 44 bc and the related roman civil wars temporarily relaxed rome 's grip on israel allowing a very brief hasmonean resurgence backed by the parthian empire
this short independence was rapidly crushed by the romans under mark antony and octavian
the installation of herod the great an idumean as king in 37 bc made israel a roman client state and marked the end of the hasmonean dynasty
in ad 6 rome joined judea proper samaria and idumea biblical edom into the roman province of iudaea
in ad 44 rome installed the rule of a roman procurator side by side with the rule of the herodian kings specifically agrippa i 41–44 and agrippa ii 50–100

10]backgroundat the beginning of the 2nd century bc the seleucid empire in yellow expanded into israel at the expense of ptolemaic egypt blue
the lands of the former kingdom of israel and kingdom of judah c. 722–586 bc had been occupied in turn by assyria babylonia the achaemenid empire and alexander the great 's hellenic macedonian empire c. 330 bc although jewish religious practice and culture had persisted and even flourished during certain periods
the entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of alexander 's empire the seleucid empire and ptolemaic egypt during the six syrian wars of the 3rd–1st centuries bc after two centuries of peace under the persians the hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires the seleucid state with its capital in syria to the north and the ptolemaic state with its capital in egypt to the south between 319 and 302 bc jerusalem changed hands seven times
 11]under antiochus iii the seleucids wrested control of israel from the ptolemies for the final time defeating ptolemy v epiphanes at the battle of panium in 198 bc
seleucid rule over the jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of hellenistic cultural and religious practices in addition to the turmoil of war there arose in the jewish nation pro seleucid and pro ptolemaic parties and the schism exercised great influence upon the judaism of the time
it was in antioch that the jews first made the acquaintance of hellenism and of the more corrupt sides of greek culture and it was from antioch that judea henceforth was ruled
 12]historical sources wojciech stattler 's machabeusze maccabees 1844 the origin of the hasmonean dynasty is recorded in the books 1 maccabees and 2 maccabees covering the period from 175 to 134 bc during which time the hasmonean dynasty became semi independent from the seleucid empire but had not yet expanded far outside of judea
the books are considered part of the biblical canon by the catholic and eastern orthodox churches and apocryphal by most protestant christians but are not a part of the hebrew bible
they are written from the point of view that the salvation of the jewish people in a crisis came from god through the family of mattathias particularly his sons judas maccabeus jonathan apphus and simon thassi and his grandson john hyrcanus
the books include historical and religious material from the septuagint that was codified by catholics and eastern orthodox christians
the other primary source for the hasmonean dynasty is the first book of the wars of the jews by the jewish historian josephus 37 shortly after ad 100
4 josephus account is the only primary source covering the history of the hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 to 63 bc
notably josephus a roman citizen and former general in the galilee who survived the roman jewish wars of the 1st century was a jew who was captured by and cooperated with the romans writing his books in rome which has caused some to question his impartiality and credibility as a historian
13]the books of maccabees use the names judea and israel or cognates as geographical descriptors throughout for both the land and people over whom the hasmoneans would rule
the talmud includes one of the hasmonean kings under the description kings of israel
scholars refer to the state as the hasmonean kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of israel
the name judaea has also been used to describe the hasmonean kingdom although this name reflects the later designation of the region under the romans at the time of josephus writings in the late 1st century

the greek inscription reads s os t f s f
king antiochus the divine epiphanus bringer of victory
the hellenization of the jews in the pre hasmonean period was not universally resisted
generally the jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally
nevertheless jews were divided between those favoring hellenization and those opposing it and were divided over allegiance to the ptolemies or seleucids
when the high priest simon ii died in 175 bc conflict broke out between supporters of his son onias iii who opposed hellenization and favored the ptolemies and his son jason who favored hellenization and the seleucids
a period of political intrigue followed with priests such as menelaus bribing the king to win the high priesthood and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title
the result was a brief civil war
the tobiads a philo hellenistic party succeeded in placing jason into the powerful position of high priest
he established an arena for public games close by the temple
14 author lee i. levine notes the piece de resistance of judaean hellenization and the most dramatic of all these developments occurred in 175 bc when the high priest jason converted jerusalem into a greek polis replete with gymnasium and ephebeion 2 maccabees 4
whether this step represents the culmination of a 150 year process of hellenization within jerusalem in general or whether it was only the initiative of a small coterie of jerusalem priests with no wider ramifications has been debated for decades
 15 some jews are known to have engaged in non surgical foreskin restoration in order to join the dominant cultural practice of socializing naked in the gymnasium where their circumcision would have been a social stigma
16]antiochus iv against jerusalem the hellenistic trends in jewish society were however inadequate protection against antiochus
in 168 bc after successfully invading the ptolemaic kingdom of egypt apparently without jewish support antiochus iv was pressured by the roman republic to withdraw
according to livy popilius placed in antiochus hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate to withdraw
and drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate
 17 returning toward antioch the troops of antiochus sacked jerusalem and removed the sacred objects from the jerusalem temple slaughtering an unknown but large number of jews and after that antiochus had smitten egypt he returned again in the hundred forty and third year and went up against israel and jerusalem with a great multitude and entered proudly into the sanctuary and took away the golden altar and the candlestick of light and all the vessels thereof
and when he had taken all away he went into his own land having made a great massacre and spoken very proudly
therefore there was a great mourning in israel in every place where they were
 1 maccabees 1:20–25)[18]he then imposed a tax and established a fortress in jerusalem
antiochus tried to suppress public observance of jewish laws apparently in an attempt to secure control over the jews
his government set up an idol of zeus[19 on the temple mount which jews considered to be desecration of the mount it also forbade both circumcision and possession of jewish scriptures on pain of death
according to josephus now antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city or with its pillage or with the great slaughter he had made there but being overcome with his violent passions and remembering what he had suffered during the siege he compelled the jews to dissolve the laws of their country and to keep their infants uncircumcised and to sacrifice swine 's flesh upon the altar

he also outlawed observance of the sabbath and the offering of sacrifices at the jerusalem temple and required jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols punitive executions were also instituted
possession of jewish scriptures was made a capital offence
the motives of antiochus are unclear
he may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee menelaus,[21
he may have been responding to a jewish revolt that had drawn on the temple and the torah for its strength or he may have been encouraged by a group of radical hellenizers among the jews
22]see also antinomianism in the books of the maccabees
maccabean revolt main article maccabean revolt the author of the first book of maccabees regarded the maccabean revolt as a rising of pious jews against the seleucid king who had tried to eradicate their religion and against the jews who supported him
the author of the second book of maccabees presented the conflict as a struggle between judaism and hellenism words that he was the first to use
22 modern scholarship tends to the second view
most modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in a civil war between traditionalist jews in the countryside and hellenized jews in jerusalem
23][24][25 according to joseph p. schultz modern scholarship considers the maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the jewish camp
 26 in the conflict over the office of high priest traditionalists with hebrew aramaic names like onias contested with hellenizers with greek names like jason and menelaus
27 other authors point to social and economic factors in the conflict
28][29 what began as a civil war took on the character of an invasion when the hellenistic kingdom of syria sided with the hellenizing jews against the traditionalists
30 as the conflict escalated antiochus prohibited the practices of the traditionalists thereby in a departure from usual seleucid practice banning the religion of an entire people
29 other scholars argue that while the rising began as a religious rebellion it was gradually transformed into a war of national liberation
31]the two most prominent 20th century scholars of the maccabean revolt elias bickermann and victor tcherikover each have very different views for the cause of the revolt focused on the policies of the jewish leaders and not antiochus iv bickermann saw the origin of the problem in the attempt of hellenized jews to reform the antiquated and outdated religion practiced in jerusalem and to rid it of superstitious elements
they were the ones who egged on antiochus iv and instituted the religious reform in jerusalem
one suspects that bickermann may have been influenced in his view by an antipathy to reform judaism in 19th- and 20th century germany
tcherikover perhaps influenced by socialist concerns saw the uprising as one of the rural peasants against the rich elite
32]the descendants of mattathias according to i and ii maccabees the priestly family of mattathias mattisyahu mattitiyahu in hebrew which came to be known as the maccabees,[33 called the people forth to holy war against the seleucids
mattathias sons judah yehuda jonathan yonoson/ yonatan and simon shimon began a military campaign initially with disastrous results one thousand jewish men women and children were killed by seleucid troops because they refused to fight even in self defense on the sabbath
other jews then reasoned that they must fight when attacked even on the sabbath
the institution of guerrilla warfare practices by judah over several years led to victory against the seleucids it was now in the fall of 165 that judah 's successes began to disturb the central government
he appears to have controlled the road from jaffa to jerusalem and thus to have cut off the royal party in acra from direct communication with the sea and thus with the government
it is significant that this time the syrian troops under the leadership of the governor general lysias took the southerly route by way of idumea
34]in 164 bc judah captured jerusalem and the temple in jerusalem was freed and reconsecrated after having recovered jerusalem judah ordered the temple to be cleansed a new altar to be built in place of the desecrated one and new holy vessels to be made
35 the celebratory festival of hanukkah is instituted when the fire had been kindled anew upon the altar and the lamps of the candlestick lit the dedication of the altar was celebrated for eight days amid sacrifices and songs
36]antiochus iv died that same year and was ultimately succeeded by demetrius i soter the nephew whose throne he had usurped
demetrius sent the general bacchides to israel with a large army in order to install alcimus with the office of high priest
37 bacchides subdued jerusalem and returned to his king
38]from revolt to independence judah and jonathan palestine under the maccabees according to george adam smith after five years of war and raids judah sought an alliance with the roman republic to remove the greeks in the year 161 bc he sent eupolemus the son of johanan and jason the son of eleazar to make a league of amity and confederacy with the romans
39]a seleucid army under general nicanor was defeated by judah ib 7:26–50 at the battle of adasa with nicanor himself killed in action
next bacchides was sent with alcimus and an army of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry and met judah at the battle of elasa laisa where this time it was the hasmonean commander who was killed
161/160 bc
bacchides now established the hellenes as rulers in israel and upon judah 's death the persecuted patriots under jonathan brother of judah fled beyond the jordan river
ib 9:25–27
they set camp near a morass by the name of asphar and remained after several engagements with the seleucids in the swamp in the country east of the jordan
following the death of his puppet governor alcimus high priest of jerusalem bacchides felt secure enough to leave the country but two years after the departure of bacchides from israel the city of acre felt sufficiently threatened by maccabee incursions to contact demetrius and request the return of bacchides to their territory
jonathan and simeon now more experienced in guerilla warfare thought it well to retreat farther and accordingly fortified in the desert a place called beth hogla;[40 there they were besieged several days by bacchides
jonathan offered the rival general a peace treaty and exchange of prisoners of war
bacchides readily consented and even took an oath of nevermore making war upon jonathan
he and his forces then vacated israel
the victorious jonathan now took up his residence in the old city of michmash
from there he endeavored to clear the land of the godless and the apostate
41 the chief source 1 maccabees says that with this the sword ceased in israel and in fact nothing is reported for the five following years 158–153 bc
seleucid civil conflict an important external event brought the design of the maccabeans to fruition
demetrius i soter 's relations with attalus ii philadelphus of pergamon reigned 159–138 bc ptolemy vi of egypt reigned 163–145 bc and ptolemy 's co ruler cleopatra ii of egypt were deteriorating and they supported a rival claimant to the seleucid throne alexander balas who purported to be the son of antiochus iv epiphanes and a first cousin of demetrius
demetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of judea except those in the city of acre and at beth zur to bolster his strength
furthermore he made a bid for the loyalty of jonathan permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the city of acre jonathan gladly accepted these terms took up residence at jerusalem in 153 bc and began fortifying the city
alexander balas offered jonathan even more favorable terms including official appointment as high priest in jerusalem and despite a second letter from demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee,[42 jonathan declared allegiance to balas
jonathan became the official leader of his people and officiated at the feast of tabernacles of 153 bc wearing the high priest 's garments
the hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences
soon demetrius lost both his throne and his life in 150 bc
the victorious alexander balas was given the further honor of marriage to cleopatra thea daughter of his allies ptolemy vi and cleopatra ii
jonathan was invited to ptolemais for the ceremony appearing with presents for both kings and was permitted to sit between them as their equal balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor
balas appointed jonathan as strategos and meridarch i.e. civil governor of a province details not found in josephus sent him back with honors to jerusalem,[43 and refused to listen to the hellenistic party 's complaints against jonathan
hasmoneans under balas and demetrius iiin 147 bc demetrius ii nicator a son of demetrius i soter claimed balas throne
the governor of coele syria apollonius taos used the opportunity to challenge jonathan to battle saying that the jews might for once leave the mountains and venture out into the plain
citation needed jonathan and simeon led a force of 10,000 men against apollonius forces in jaffa which was unprepared for the rapid attack and opened the gates in surrender to the jewish forces
apollonius received reinforcements from azotus and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces
jonathan assaulted captured and burned azotus along with the resident temple of dagon and the surrounding villages
alexander balas honored the victorious high priest by giving him the city of ekron along with its outlying territory
the people of azotus complained to king ptolemy vi who had come to make war upon his son in law but jonathan met ptolemy at jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the river eleutherus
jonathan then returned to jerusalem maintaining peace with the king of egypt despite their support for different contenders for the seleucid throne
44]hasmoneans under demetrius and diodotus in 145 bc the battle of antioch resulted in the final defeat of alexander balas by the forces of his father in law ptolemy vi
ptolemy himself however was among the casualties of the battle
demetrius ii nicator remained sole ruler of the seleucid empire and became the second husband of cleopatra thea
jonathan owed no allegiance to the new king and took this opportunity to lay siege to the acra the seleucid fortress in jerusalem and the symbol of seleucid control over judea
it was heavily garrisoned by a seleucid force and offered asylum to jewish hellenists
45 demetrius was greatly incensed he appeared with an army at ptolemais and ordered jonathan to come before him
without raising the siege jonathan accompanied by the elders and priests went to the king and pacified him with presents so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest but gave to him the three samaritan toparchies of mount ephraim lod and ramathaim zophim
in consideration of a present of 300 talents the entire country was exempted from taxes the exemption being confirmed in writing
jonathan in return lifted the siege of the acra and left it in seleucid hands
soon however a new claimant to the seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young antiochus vi dionysus son of alexander balas and cleopatra thea
he was three years old at most but general diodotus tryphon used him to advance his own designs on the throne
in the face of this new enemy demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the city of acre but also called jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops
the 3,000 men of jonathan protected demetrius in his capital antioch against his own subjects
46]as demetrius ii did not keep his promise jonathan thought it better to support the new king when diodotus tryphon and antiochus vi seized the capital especially as the latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother simon simeon strategos of the paralia the seacoast from the ladder of tyre to the frontier of egypt
47]jonathan and simon were now entitled to make conquests ashkelon submitted voluntarily while gaza was forcibly taken
jonathan vanquished even the strategoi of demetrius ii far to the north in the plain of hazar while simon at the same time took the strong fortress of beth zur on the pretext that it harbored supporters of demetrius
48]like judah in former years jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples
he renewed the treaty with the roman republic and exchanged friendly messages with sparta and other places
however one should note that the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity
diodotus tryphon went with an army to judea and invited jonathan to scythopolis for a friendly conference where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men promising to give him ptolemais and other fortresses
jonathan fell into the trap he took with him to ptolemais 1,000 men all of whom were slain he himself was taken prisoner
49]simon assumes leadership when diodotus tryphon was about to enter judea at hadid he was confronted by the new jewish leader simon ready for battle
trypho avoiding an engagement demanded one hundred talents and jonathan 's two sons as hostages in return for which he promised to liberate jonathan
although simon did not trust diodotus tryphon he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother
but diodotus tryphon did not liberate his prisoner angry that simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing he executed jonathan at baskama in the country east of the jordan
50 jonathan was buried by simeon at modin
nothing is known of his two captive sons
one of his daughters was an ancestor of josephus
51]simon assumed the leadership 142 bc receiving the double office of high priest and prince of israel
the leadership of the hasmoneans was established by a resolution adopted in 141 bc at a large assembly of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land to the effect that simon should be their leader and high priest forever until there should arise a faithful prophet 1 macc 14:41
ironically the election was performed in hellenistic fashion
simon having made the jewish people semi independent of the seleucid greeks reigned from 142 to 135 bc and formed the hasmonean dynasty
the roman senate accorded the new dynasty recognition by the romans c. 139 bc when the delegation of simon was in rome
simon led the people in peace and prosperity until in february 135 bc he was assassinated at the instigation of his son in law ptolemy son of abubus also spelled abobus or abobi who had been named governor of the region by the seleucids
simon 's eldest sons mattathias and judah were also murdered
hasmonean expansion and civil war kingdom at its greatest extent under salome alexandra in c. 135 bc john hyrcanus simon 's third son assumed the leadership and ruled as high priest kohen gadol and took a greek regnal name see hyrcania in an acceptance of the hellenistic culture of his seleucid suzerains
within a year of the death of simon seleucid king antiochus vii sidetes attacked jerusalem
according to josephus,[52
john hyrcanus opened king david 's sepulchre and removed three thousand talents which he paid as tribute to spare the city
he remained as governor as a seleucid vassal
for the next two decades of his reign hyrcanus continued like his father to rule semi autonomously from the seleucids
the seleucid empire had been disintegrating in the face of the seleucid parthian wars and in 129 bc antiochus vii sidetes was killed in media by the forces of phraates ii of parthia permanently ending seleucid rule east of the euphrates
in 116 bc a civil war between seleucid half brothers antiochus viii grypus and antiochus ix cyzicenus broke out resulting in a further breakup of the already significantly reduced kingdom
this provided opportunity for semi independent seleucid client states such as judea to revolt
53][54][55 in 110 bc john hyrcanus carried out the first military conquests of the newly independent hasmonean kingdom raising a mercenary army to capture madaba and schechem significantly increasing his regional influence[56][57]hyrcanus conquered transjordan samaria galilee and idumea also known as edom and forced idumeans to convert to judaism hyrcanus subdued all the idumeans and permitted them to stay in that country if they would circumcise their genitals and make use of the laws of the jews and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers that they submitted to the use of circumcision 25 and of the rest of the jewish ways of living at which time therefore this befell them that they were hereafter no other than jews
58]he desired that his wife succeed him as head of the government with his eldest of five sons aristobulus i becoming only the high priest
aristobulus was the first hasmonean to take the title basileus asserting the new found independence of the state
upon hyrcanus death however aristobulus jailed his mother and three brothers including alexander jannaeus and allowed her to starve there
by this means he came into possession of the throne but died one year later after a painful illness in 103 bc
aristobulus brothers were freed from prison by his widow alexander reigned from 103–76 bc and died during the siege of the fortress ragaba
in c. 87 bc according to josephus following a six year civil war involving seleucid king demetrius iii eucaerus hasmonean ruler alexander jannaeus crucified 800 jewish rebels in jerusalem
alexander was followed by his wife salome alexandra who reigned from 76–67 bc
she was the only regnant jewish queen
during her reign her son hyrcanus ii held the office of high priest and was named her successor
pharisee and sadducee factions
it is difficult to state at what time the pharisees as a party arose
josephus first mentions them in connection with jonathan the successor of judas maccabeus ant xiii 5 9
one of the factors that distinguished the pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the temple was their belief that all jews had to observe the purity laws which applied to the temple service outside the temple
the major difference however was the continued adherence of the pharisees to the laws and traditions of the jewish people in the face of assimilation
as josephus noted the pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of jewish law
during the hasmonean period the sadducees and pharisees functioned primarily as political parties
although the pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the idumeans the political rift between them became wider when pharisees demanded that the hasmonean king alexander jannaeus choose between being king and being high priest
in response the king openly sided with the sadducees by adopting their rites in the temple
his actions caused a riot in the temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the pharisees although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties
alexander was succeeded by his widow salome alexandra whose brother was shimon ben shetach a leading pharisee
upon her death her elder son hyrcanus sought pharisee support and her younger son aristobulus sought the support of the sadducees
the conflict between hyrcanus and aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the roman general pompey captured jerusalem in 63 bc and inaugurated the roman period of jewish history
josephus attests that salome alexandra was very favorably inclined toward the pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign especially in the institution known as the sanhedrin
later texts such as the mishnah and the talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the temple torts criminal law and governance
the influence of the pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong and their rulings on jewish law were deemed authoritative by many
although these texts were written long after these periods many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the second temple era
civil war alexander jannaeus son hyrcanus ii had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother aristobulus ii rose in rebellion whereupon hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of mercenaries and his pharisee followers now hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom and to him did his mother commit it before she died but aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity and when there was a battle between them to decide the dispute about the kingdom near jericho the greatest part deserted hyrcanus and went over to aristobulus
59]hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of jerusalem but the capture of the temple by aristobulus ii compelled hyrcanus to surrender
a peace was then concluded according to the terms of which hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest comp
schürer gesch i. 291 note 2 but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office but hyrcanus with those of his party who stayed with him fled to antonia and got into his power the hostages which were aristobulus 's wife with her children that he might persevere but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes that aristobulus should be king and hyrcanus should resign but retain all the rest of his dignities as being the king 's brother
hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the temple and embraced one another in a very kind manner while the people stood round about them they also changed their houses while aristobulus went to the royal palace and hyrcanus retired to the house of aristobulus
59 aristobulus ruled from 67–63 bc
from 63–40 bc the government was in the hands of hyrcanus ii as high priest and ethnarch although effective power was in the hands of his adviser antipater the idumaean
intrigues of antipater the struggle would have ended here but for antipater the idumean
antipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition the control of judea under the government of the weak hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic aristobulus
he accordingly began to impress upon hyrcanus mind that aristobulus was planning his death finally persuading him to take refuge with aretas king of the nabatæans
aretas bribed by antipater who also promised him the restitution of the arabian towns taken by the hasmoneans readily espoused the cause of hyrcanus and advanced toward jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand
during the siege which lasted several months the adherents of hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the jews they stoned the pious onias see honi ha magel and instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice sent a pig
honi ordered to curse the besieged prayed lord of the universe as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to thy people i beseech thee not to answer the evil prayers of either

the pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources
according to josephus the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand drachmas they had asked for the lamb
roman intervention pompey the great pompey in the temple of jerusalem by jean fouquet
while this civil war was going on the roman general marcus aemilius scaurus went to syria to take possession in the name of gnaeus pompeius magnus of the kingdom of the seleucids
the brothers appealed to him each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side
at first scaurus moved by a gift of four hundred talents decided in favor of aristobulus
aretas was ordered to withdraw his army from judea and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of aristobulus
but when pompey came to syria 63 bc a different situation arose
pompey who had just been awarded the title conqueror of asia due to his decisive victories in asia minor over pontus and the seleucid empire had decided to bring judea under the rule of the romans
he took the same view of hyrcanus ability and was moved by much the same motives as antipater as a ward of rome hyrcanus would be more acceptable than aristobulus
when therefore the brothers as well as delegates of the people 's party which weary of hasmonean quarrels desired the extinction of the dynasty presented themselves before pompey he delayed the decision in spite of aristobulus gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents
the latter however fathomed the designs of pompey and assembled his armies
pompey defeated him multiple times however and captured his cities
aristobulus ii entrenched himself in the fortress of alexandrium but soon realizing the uselessness of resistance surrendered at the first summons of the romans and undertook to deliver jerusalem to them
the patriots however were not willing to open their gates to the romans and a siege ensued which ended with the capture of the city
pompey entered the holy of holies this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot
judaea had to pay tribute to rome and was placed under the supervision of the roman governor of syria in 63 bc judaea became a protectorate of rome
coming under the administration of a governor judaea was allowed a king the governor 's business was to regulate trade and maximize tax revenue
60]in 57–55 bc aulus gabinius proconsul of syria split the former hasmonean kingdom into galilee samaria and judea with five districts of legal and religious councils known as sanhedrin greek s d synedrion and when he had ordained five councils s
d a he distributed the nation into the same number of parts
so these councils governed the people the first was at jerusalem the second at gadara the third at amathus the fourth at jericho and the fifth at sepphoris in galilee
61][62]pompey and caesar julius caesar initially supported aristobulus against hyrcanus and antipater
between the weakness of hyrcanus and the ambition of aristobulus judea lost its independence
aristobulus was taken to rome a prisoner and hyrcanus was reappointed high priest but without political authority
when in 50 bc it appeared that julius caesar was interested in using aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of judea from hyrcanus and antipater who were beholden to pompey supporters of pompey had aristobulus poisoned in rome and executed alexander in antioch
however pompey 's pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side at the beginning of the civil war between caesar and pompey hyrcanus at the instance of antipater prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position but when pompey was murdered antipater led the jewish forces to the help of caesar who was hard pressed at alexandria
his timely help and his influence over the egyptian jews recommended him to caesar 's favor and secured for him an extension of his authority in palestine and for hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy
joppa was restored to the hasmonean domain judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to rome and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed
63]the timely aid from antipater and hyrcanus led the triumphant caesar to ignore the claims of aristobulus 's younger son antigonus the hasmonean and to confirm hyrcanus and antipater in their authority despite their previous allegiance to pompey
josephus noted antigonus came to caesar and accused hyrcanus and antipater how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country and that as to the assistance they had sent to caesar into egypt it was not done out of good will to him but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to his enemy pompey
64]hyrcanus restoration as ethnarch in 47 bc coincided with caesar 's appointment of antipater as the first roman procurator allowing antipater to promote the interests of his own house caesar appointed hyrcanus to be high priest and gave antipater what principality he himself should choose leaving the determination to himself so he made him procurator of judea
65]antipater appointed his sons to positions of influence phasael became governor of jerusalem and herod governor of galilee
this led to increasing tension between hyrcanus and the family of antipater culminating in a trial of herod for supposed abuses in his governorship which resulted in herod 's flight into exile in 46 bc herod soon returned however and the honors to antipater 's family continued
hyrcanus incapacity and weakness were so manifest that when he defended herod against the sanhedrin and before mark antony the latter stripped hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title bestowing them both upon the accused
caesar was assassinated in 44 bc and unrest and confusion spread throughout the roman world including judaea
antipater the idumean was assassinated by a rival malichus in 43 bc but antipater 's sons managed to kill malichus and maintain their control over judea and their father 's puppet hasmonean hyrcanus
parthian invasion antony augustus the taking of jerusalem by herod the great 36 bc sic)parthian empire at its greatest extent c. 60 bcafter julius caesar was murdered in 44 bc quintus labienus a roman republican general and ambassador to the parthians sided with brutus and cassius in the liberators civil war after their defeat labienus joined the parthians and assisted them in invading roman territories in 40 bc
the parthian army crossed the euphrates and labienus was able to entice mark antony 's roman garrisons around syria to rally to his cause
the parthians split their army and under pacorus conquered the levant from the phoenician coast through the land of israel antigonus roused the parthians to invade syria and palestine and the jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the maccabean house and drove out the hated idumeans with their puppet jewish king
the struggle between the people and the romans had begun in earnest and though antigonus when placed on the throne by the parthians proceeded to spoil and harry the jews rejoicing at the restoration of the hasmonean line thought a new era of independence had come
66]when phasael and hyrcanus ii set out on an embassy to the parthians the parthians instead captured them
antigonus who was present cut off hyrcanus 's ears to make him unsuitable for the high priesthood while phasael was put to death
antigonus whose hebrew name was mattathias bore the double title of king and high priest for only three years as he had not disposed of herod the most dangerous of his enemies
herod fled into exile and sought the support of mark antony
herod was designated king of the jews by the roman senate in 40 bc antony then resolved to get herod made king of the jews
and told the senate that it was for their advantage in the parthian war that herod should be king so they all gave their votes for it
and when the senate was separated antony and caesar augustus went out with herod between them while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them in order to offer sacrifices to the roman gods and to lay the decree in the capitol
antony also made a feast for herod on the first day of his reign
 67]the struggle thereafter lasted for some years as the main roman forces were occupied with defeating the parthians and had few additional resources to use to support herod
after the parthians defeat herod was victorious over his rival in 37 bc
antigonus was delivered to antony and executed shortly thereafter
the romans assented to herod 's proclamation as king of the jews bringing about the end of the hasmonean rule over judea
herod and the end of the dynasty antigonus was not however the last hasmonean
the fate of the remaining male members of the family under herod was not a happy one
aristobulus iii grandson of aristobulus ii through his elder son alexander was briefly made high priest but was soon executed 36 bc due to herod 's jealousy
his sister mariamne was married to herod but fell victim to his notorious jealousy
her sons by herod aristobulus iv and alexander were in their adulthood also executed by their father
hyrcanus ii had been held by the parthians since 40 bc
for four years until 36 bc he lived amid the babylonian jews who paid him every mark of respect
in that year herod who feared that hyrcanus might induce the parthians to help him regain the throne invited him to return to jerusalem
the babylonian jews warned him in vain
herod received him with every mark of respect assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him
as the last remaining hasmonean hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for herod
in the year 30 bc charged with plotting with the king of arabia hyrcanus was condemned and executed
the later herodian rulers agrippa i and agrippa ii both had hasmonean blood as agrippa i 's father was aristobulus iv son of herod by mariamne i but they were not direct male descendants unless herod was understood as a hasmonean as per the following synthesis according to josephus herod was also of maccabean descent eleazar maccabeus called auran brother of judas maccabeus josephus antiquity of the jews book xii chapter 9 section 4 jason son of eleazar ditto book xii chapter 10 section 6 antipater i son of jason ditto book xiii chapter 5 section 8 antipater ii antipas son of antipater i ditto book xiv chapter 1 section 3 herod legacy and scholarship while the hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent jewish kingdom its successes were rather short lived and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the maccabee brothers had gained
jewish nationalism the fall of the hasmonean kingdom marked an end to a century of jewish self governance but jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under roman rule beginning with the census of quirinius in 6 and leading to a series of jewish roman wars in the 1st–2nd centuries including the great revolt ad 66–73 the kitos war 115–117 and bar kokhba 's revolt 132–135
during the wars temporary commonwealths were established but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of rome
roman legions under vespasian and titus besieged and destroyed jerusalem looted and burned herod 's temple in the year 70 and jewish strongholds notably gamla in 67 and masada in 73 and enslaved or massacred a large part of the jewish population
the defeat of the jewish revolts against the roman empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the jewish diaspora as many jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into slavery throughout the empire
jewish religious scholarship jewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of king david
the hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with greek names and the dynasty eventually became very hellenized to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally minded jewish subjects
frequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among jews of later generations that the latter hasmoneans were degenerate
one member of this school was josephus whose accounts are in many cases our sole source of information about the hasmoneans
