the acra was the seleucid stronghold built in 186 bc against the south wall of solomon ’s temple mount on the ophel
it was used as a military post against the jewish people who lived to the south and west and to monitor temple mount activities between the years of 186 141 bc
at that time the acra was torn down andthe temple mount was extended to the south to cover it up in 141 bc
two tunnels with staircases were added during this southern extension to increase access tothe temple mount surface
these tunnels would be extended and accessed by herod ’s double and triple gates later
