where was the first temple
the book of genesis 22:7 -14 tells us that the near sacrifice of isaac occurred on the mountain of yahweh in the land of moriah":and isaac said here is the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
 and abraham said god will provide yireh himself with the lamb for burnt offering my son
they come to the place
abraham builds the altar arranges the wood ties isaac up and places him on the altar
he takes the knife
but the angel of yahweh called to him out of the sky and said abraham abraham 
he said here i am 
he said do n’t lay your hand on the boy neither do anything to him
for now i know that you fear
= yireh god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me 
abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns
abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son
abraham called the name of that place yahweh yireh
will provide
as it is said to this day on yahweh ’s mountain yera'eh
it will be provided
the samaritans identify yahweh 's mountain with gerizim but the post exilic writer of chronicles 2 chron 3:1 puts it in jerusalem
whether or not we can relate mount moriah to jerusalem there were additional reasons to build the temple here
for during the city 's first eight centuries the jerusalemites lived on this hill alone albeit farther down on the narrower spur to the south near the spring
details here however on the peak was the outcropping of bedrock that today gives the dome its name
perhaps it exerted a numinous power
admittedly though the rock is nowhere mentioned in our sources until 333 ad if then
it is possible that the pre israelite denizens of the city worshipped from this hill facing west as the israelites later would
for the name jerusalem means not city of peace as popular etymology has it but a place founded by salem the canaanite god of the setting sun
keel proposes that under egyptian influence the pre davidic jerusalemites had an open air sanctuary to the sun god here he also holds that the easterly orientation of solomon 's temple perpetuated this tradition
indeed david must have established an accord with jerusalem 's earlier inhabitants the jebusites for he goes up and buys the threshing floor of arauna the jebusite erecting a sacrificial altar there 2 samuel 24 24 25
the passage does not say where this threshing floor was but the area of the rock is windy enough
if we accept the account in 1 kings 6 and 7 solomon 's palace was bigger than the temple
the palace was 100 cubits long 50 wide and 30 high taking 13 years to build
the temple by contrast was 60 cubits long by 20 wide and 30 high taking 7 years
a note on the height
the arrangement of these buildings is not stated although it is clear from 1 kings 7 21 that the temple faced east
there would not have been space for such large edifices in the city of david which was below to the south
because of the deep valleys the only room for that original city 's expansion was to the north
no trace of palace or temple or of anything almost from the first temple period has been found in the ophel excavations so we are left with the space beneath herod 's temple platform
this is under the civil control of the muslim supreme council waqf
even if the waqf permitted digging however it is doubtful whether any structural remains from the early time would turn up
the area underwent radical rebuilding by herod
furthermore for centuries after the destruction of 70 ad until the 7th century muslims cleaned it up and erected their sanctuaries it was exploited as a source of building stones and as farmland
before solomon 's palace and temple were built the hill would have afforded an ideal place from which to attack the city as we can see in the contour lines that charles warren and charles wilson were able to establish the building of the palace and temple near the peak may have been in part an act of fortification
the amply level area around today 's dome of the rock was partly defended against attack from the north by valleys entering from east and west
you can see them by enlarging the map on the right which is mainly devoted to the cisterns and water supply
the valleys fail to unite but precisely in the stretch between them wilson and warren saw that the rock gives place to turf and there are other indications which would lead us to believe that there was at one time a ditch cut in the solid rock
the ditch would have helped to protect a pre herodian temple
strabo mentions this ditch in his geography xvi par 40 saying that pompey filled it in order to conquer the temple in 63 bc
he tells us it was 60 feet deep and 250 feet wide
josephus also mentions pompey 's filling of the ditch saying that the romans did the work on the sabbaths when the jews refrained from fighting if not attacked
one wonders whether the same method might have been used by the romans when they built the assault ramp at masada in 73 ad
and here are broader views the first showing more of the natural hill as it appears at a n s line running through the dome the bottom one showing the depth of the valley at a n s line running through the haram 's eastern wall as to what the ditch defended an ancient square platform has been discerned in the haram by leen ritmeyer
in order to link this platform with the first temple however we must assume with ritmeyer that those who built the second starting in 520 bc 66 years after the first was destroyed would not have had the resources to erect the walls from scratch rather they would have built upon what remained of the earlier walls
as said above 1 kings 7 indicates that the platform of the first temple included a palace that was bigger than the temple
in his reconstruction summarized below ritmeyer does not include the palace on the platform apparently because he follows the account in the mishna
but the mishna purports to describe the second temple not the first and it was compiled around 200 ad seven centuries after the palace had last been seen on the mountain
in short if the following reconstruction pertains indeed to the first temple period then we should envision on the platform both palace and temple
ritmeyer 's reconstruction of the ancient platform begins about 15 meters south of the excavated ditch at the lowest step in the northwest staircase leading down from the present day upper platform
to locate the staircase consult the map below
it was archaeologist benjamin mazar ritmeyer 's mentor who first noticed something peculiar about this step its stones are much larger than those in the steps above it
on one of them in fact a margin and a protruding boss were once partly visible they are no longer so because the adjacent pavement has been raised
a colleague of ritmeyer 's also pointed out that this lowest step and hence its whole staircase does not line up with the wall of the present day platform as do the other staircases
instead it is parallel to the haram 's eastern wall
here is a photograph of the step in context followed by a closer look at its ashlars for a closer look at the stones in the lowest step please enlarge the photo on the right
at a point near the northern edge of this step the big stones cease and we find small ones as on the steps above
ritmeyer noted that the northern end of the northernmost large stone of this step was exactly in line with the northern edge of the raised muslim platform
it is also in line with a cut scarp observed by charles warren on which the northern edge of the muslim platform is built
if we continue this line to the east we reach a point in the eastern wall a bit north of the golden gate
the distance from the stone in the lowest step to the eastern wall is 500 royal cubits 861 feet such a cubit being 20.67 inches long
this is a remarkable finding because in ezekiel 's vision of the future temple as well as in the mishnah the temple platform is presented as a square with 500 cubits per side
below is ezekiel 42:15 20 where i have put cubits the standard hebrew version has the word for reeds for this alteration see milgrom and block p. 101 n. 268
now when he had finished measuring the inner house he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east and measured it all around
he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred cubits with the measuring reed all around
he measured on the north side five hundred cubits with the measuring reed all around
he measured on the south side five hundred cubits with the measuring reed
he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred cubits with the measuring reed
he measured it on the four sides
it had a wall around it the length five hundred and the width five hundred to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common
the 500 cubit line from the northwest staircase reaches the haram 's eastern wall at the point where in the wall 's lower parts warren saw the beginning of herod 's northward extension see the map below
the stones in the lower levels south of this point belong to the older wall of the platform
herod be it noted could not expand the platform eastward because the slope of the kidron valley is too steep so he used the older wall extending it to the north and south
if we now follow this eastern wall to the south for 500 royal cubits we come to a slight bend not visible from a distance which is 240 feet north of the southeast corner again see the map below
south of this bend in the lower parts is masonry usually identified as hasmonean although yoram tsafrir suggests that it belonged to the wall of the seleucid acra 
in any case it is evidence of expansion in the 2nd century bc and it is followed by herod 's extension which stretches southward 106 feet to the present day corner
we do not know whether the masonry changes north of the bend because in the lower level where the seleucid or hasmonean stones are warren did not penetrate far enough to the north and the political situation has precluded further underground exploration
nevertheless ritmeyer has managed to study two visible stones that are just above ground slightly north of the bend and he dates them to the time of hezekiah
from the bend we go west keeping parallel to the northern line and staying ever so slightly north of the e shaped cistern which ritmeyer suggests belonged to the acra
at 500 cubits we reach a point intersected by a 500 cubit long line from our starting point namely from the lowest step of the northwest staircase
this point see the map above is situated where the eastward ascent to herod 's platform from barclay 's gate made a 90 degree turn to the south
ritmeyer proposes that herod 's builders did not want to break through the seleucid or hasmonean wall in green on the map and so they built the turn
in this way we complete a square of 500 royal cubits on each side
as said above that is exactly the number given in ezekiel 42:15 20
was this vision inspired by the exiled prophet 's memory of the first temple
or should we suppose contra ritmeyer that the platform did not not belong to the first temple at all but rather that it was built by the returnees starting in 520 bc in deliberate accord with ezekiel
this too is possible
the 500 cubit square is also present in the mishnah
its authors were presumably describing the last temple they do not say otherwise whose herodian sides were much longer than 500 cubits
perhaps they meant the part of herod 's temple into which only jews were permitted and perhaps this coincided with the older 500 cubit square described above
we note at the bottom of the above map in this connection that the tunnels from the double and triple gates emerge into daylight precisely on the southern line of the 500 cubit platform
perhaps these gates were intended only for jews who having just taken the obligatory ritual bath wanted to enter directly into the pure area
gentiles could have entered the impure area by the western gates
but can we get any closer to the first temple
josephus war v 5.1 indicates that solomon 's temple was built on the top of the hill now this temple as i have already said was built upon a strong hill
at first the plain at the top was hardly sufficient for the holy house and the altar for the ground about it was very uneven and like a precipice but when king solomon who was the person that built the temple had built a wall to it on its east side there was then added one cloister portico founded on a bank cast up for it and on the other parts the holy house stood naked
but in future ages the people added new banks and the hill became a larger plain
yet how did josephus know where solomon 's temple was
he does n't say
he may have been reading back from herod 's which he did know
we might attempt to justify this method as follows between the first temple destroyed in 586 bc and the second commenced in 520 there were always jerusalemites living here who could point to the site
when the jews began building the second temple they would presumably have done so on the place of the first
in turn that would have been the site of herod 's grander version which josephus knew
there is a hitch in the logic however
if 1 kings 6 and 7 are accepted as historical then the king 's palace overshadowed the temple
note that josephus does not locate solomon 's palace on this hill
after the return from the babylonian exile jerusalem had no king hence no need for a palace
only a temple was built
this major change might well have occasioned a corresponding change in the layout
as to the 500 cubit square platform supposing that it did belong to the first temple the question remains as to which king of judah built it and dug its defensive ditch
in his book the quest ritmeyer nominates hezekiah allowing however that a definitive answer requires excavation
the holy of holies the holy of holies may have been where the dome of the rock is
from 1 kings 6:16 we know it was at the western extremity of solomon 's temple
as the contour maps show see above you could not go more than a few yards west of the rock without sliding downhill
leen ritmeyer has noticed a few tantalizing features of the rock
there are cuttings all over perhaps the rock was quarried for building stones
yet several cuttings may be ancient and these arouse special interest
let us stand near the reliquary on the western side looking east use the picture below between us and the hole in the rock which ritmeyer calls crusader ignoring the bordeaux pilgrim of 333 we see sections that someone cut flat
the total width of these flat sections north to south is 10 feet 4 inches 6 royal egyptian cubits
ritmeyer thinks that these were foundation trenches for building stones
according to the mishnah the walls of the holy of holies were 6 cubits thick
still using the picture above let us try to imagine this wall
note that the foundation trenches do not continue all the way to the point where the western wall of the holy of holies would have been
there is an awkward upwelling of stone just east of the reliquary
on ritmeyer 's theory this area too should be flat
apart from that the theory works nicely and harbors another surprise
having imagined this southern wall of the holy of holies let us picture its western wall starting about where the reliquary is and its northern one of equal length as well as the curtain on the east
the result is the biblical square with 20 cubits on each side
looking at the rock from above we find in the center a rectangular cut perpendicular to the western scarp
ritmeyer estimates it as 1.5 by 2.5 royal cubits
these are the dimensions of the ark of the covenant exodus 25:10
ritmeyer 's theory is at once exciting and exasperating
he may have found the place of the ark
there remains the problem of the awkward lump mentioned above
and the rock has been so chipped away
beginning a few feet to the east of the putative cutting for the ark we can see as the rock slopes down the traces of a series of cuttings with a similar form and axis
along with the supposed foundation trenches these traces leave the impression of quarrying
so does the sudden drop on its north side
the cutting for the ark may be the impression left by a quarried stone
or perhaps it was the cutting for the ark
at the time of the second temple 515 bc 70 ad no ark was present in the holy of holies
furthermore if the second temple was built here then according to the height measurements in josephus and the mishna it would have been beneath the floor see david jacobson
this would indicate that the builders had no scruples about placing pavement over the rock so perhaps it did not exert such numinous power as to determine the site of the temple first or second
we recall that the rock goes unmentioned in the sources before 333 ad
why then should we believe that the temple or altar were ever built on it
more puzzles consider the area of the ophel by enlarging the picture on the right
extensive excavations were carried out on the ophel for a decade after the 1967 war yielding very little from the first temple period although much from herod 's time and later
nevertheless a few first temple vessels did turn up at the bottom of a cistern near the second temple 's southern retaining wall
another exception was in the area near the modern road
here in 1976 archaeologists benjamin mazar and meir ben dov found part of a public building pictured here containing vessels that had been charred in the destruction of 586 bc
a decade later mazar 's granddaughter eilat continued the dig
on the basis of the pottery she dated the floor to the end of the 8th century
this floor had been preceded by an earlier one
the fill beneath the latter yielded very little pottery but between two foundation stones she found a black juglet intact that fits into the palm of a hand
its type was used in the 10th and 9th centuries bc
it may have been an heirloom placed between the stones as a kind of votive offering
on this basis she first dated the lower floor and the original building to the 9th or early 8th centuries
this does not bring us back as far as solomon but she has since revised her view taking the juglet as evidence for a 10th century solomonic date
a few meters to the south and east furthermore are two towers discovered by charles warren in the 19th century
beneath the smaller of them in 1967 kathleen kenyon found masonry consisting of large stones laid in a header stretcher pattern pictured here as 2":eilat mazar interprets this segment as part of the wall attributed to solomon in 1 kings 9 15
the segment was not necessarily part of a tower although the smaller tower later incorporated it
the larger may be the projecting tower referred to in nehemiah 3 24 27
if we grant a solomonic date for some of the sections that the mazars and ben dov uncovered we still have the question as to why the rest of the ophel is so scarce on remains from before the 8th century bc
one does not like an argument from silence but given the amount of digging that has been done in the ophel the silence here is deafening
strategically it would not have made sense to build the palace and temple above where the dome of the rock is today while leaving an empty space between the acropolis and the rest of the city
an enemy could easily take the waterless acropolis and use its buildings as fortresses while attacking the city of david
in favor of the biblical account we may raise two observations
first yes the silence is deafening but in a mountain city like jerusalem to quote the adage absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
the intensive building activity on the ophel under herod and later the omayyads might well have shaved away any first temple foundations and with them any chance of finding first temple pottery in situ
some was found in earth fills between later walls but this is not evidence for it could have been carted in
second the old fortress of zion south of the ophel apparently became irrelevant in the 10th century bc so the city probably expanded northward then as implied by the biblical account together with geographical logic
