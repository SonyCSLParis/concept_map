to 1912 norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the palaeolithic and has produced significant archaeological finds
both modern and neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago before the last glaciation and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards
the archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago partly because of the very cold conditions that existed then but also because the coastline was much further north than at present
as the ice retreated during the mesolithic the sea level rose filling what is now the north sea
this brought the norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as doggerland

long found on the present day coast at titchwell marsh date from a time when it was 60 â€ 70 km from the sea
other flint tools have been found dating from the upper paleolithic 50,000â€“10,000 bce to the neolithic 5,000â€“2,500 bce
an eye is an area of higher ground in the marshes dry enough to support buildings

originally on the south side of the glaven blakeney eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries and a building known as blakeney chapel which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600 and again in the late 17th century
despite its name it is unlikely that it had a religious function
nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent birks 2003 pp

the spit sheltered the glaven ports blakeney cley next the sea and wiveton which were important medieval harbours
blakeney sent ships to help edward i 's war efforts in 1301 and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only norfolk port between king 's lynn and great yarmouth to have customs officials
blakeney church has a second tower at its east end an unusual feature in a rural parish church
it has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners retrieved 10 september 2011
perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet 's sandbanks that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven including a carvel built wooden ship
land reclamation schemes especially those by henry calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of cley led to the silting up of the glaven shipping channel and relocation of cley 's wharf
further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the salthouse marshes to the east of cley
in an attempt to halt the decline thomas telford was consulted in 1822 but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented and by 1840 almost all of cley 's trade had been lost

the population stagnated and the value of all property decreased sharply

port of cley and blakeney in appendix to blakeney 's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival and in 1817 the channel to the haven was deepened to improve access
packet ships ran to hull and london from 1840 but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour

wikipedia by jimfbleak /by sa/3.0in the decades preceding world war i this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling locals were looking for food but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds norfolk 's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884
in 1901 the blakeney and cley wild bird protection society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its watcher bob pinchen the first of only six men up to 2012 to hold that post
in 1910 the owner of the point augustus cholmondeley gough calthorpe 6th baron calthorpe leased the land to university college london who also purchased the old lifeboat house at the end of the spit
when the baron died later that year his heirs put blakeney point up for sale raising the possibility of development
in 1912 a public appeal initiated by charles rothschild and organised by ucl professor francis wall oliver and dr sidney long enabled the purchase of blakeney point from the calthorpe estate and the land was then donated to the national trust
ucl established a research centre at the old lifeboat house in 1913 where oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of blakeney point
the building is still used by students and also acts as an information centre
despite formal protection the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s
the point was designated as a site of special scientific interest sssi in 1954 along with the adjacent cley marshes reserve and subsumed into the newly created 7,700 hectare 19,000 acre
north norfolk coast sssi in 1986
the larger area is now additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa and ramsar listings iucn category iv habitat species management area and is part of the norfolk coast area of outstanding natural beauty
the point became a national nature reserve nnr in 1994 and the coast from holkham nnr to salthouse together with scolt head island became a biosphere reserve in 1976
