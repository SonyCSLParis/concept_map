the convention of 1833 april 1–13 1833 a political gathering of settlers in mexican texas was a successor to the convention of 1832 whose requests had not been addressed by the mexican government
despite the political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war 56 delegates met in san felipe de austin to draft a series of petitions to the mexican government
the volatile william h. wharton presided over the meeting
although the convention 's agenda largely mirrored that of the convention of 1832 delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province which was at the time part of the state of coahuila y tejas
under the guidance of sam houston former governor of the us state of tennessee a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the mexican congress
the proposed constitution was largely patterned on us political principles yet retained several spanish customs
delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into texas be lifted
some residents complained that this convention like its predecessor was illegal
nevertheless stephen f. austin journeyed to mexico city to present the petitions to the government
frustrated with the lack of progress in october austin wrote a letter encouraging texans to form their own state government
this letter was forwarded to the mexican government and austin was imprisoned in early 1834
during his imprisonment the federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate the colonists including the introduction of trial by jury
austin acknowledged that e]very evil complained of has been remedied
 1 background mexico won its independence from spain in 1821
after the new country 's monarchy was overthrown the constitution of 1824 established a federalist republic composed of multiple states
sparsely populated provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas
mexican texas which marked the country 's eastern border with the united states was combined with coahuila to form the new state coahuila y tejas
2 to facilitate government of the large area the state was subdivided into several departments all of texas was included in the department of béxar
3]texas was part of the mexican frontier and settlers faced frequent raids by native tribes
bankrupt and unable to provide much military assistance in 1824 the federal government legalized immigration from the united states and europe hoping that an influx of settlers would discourage raiding
2 as the number of americans living in texas increased mexican authorities became apprehensive that the united states intended to annex the area possibly by force
4][5 to curb the perceived threat the mexican government passed the law of april 6 1830 which restricted immigration from the united states into texas and called for the first enforcement of customs duties
4 the new laws were unpopular with both native mexicans in texas tejanos and recent immigrants texians
6]in 1832 general antonio lópez de santa anna led a revolt against president anastasio bustamante 's centralist government
7 under the pretext that they supported santa anna a small group of texians armed themselves and overthrew the commander of the garrison that was enforcing the new customs duties
8 other settlers followed their example and within weeks all mexican soldiers in eastern texas had been forced to leave
9 in 1832 general antonio lópez de santa anna led a revolt against president anastasio bustamante 's centralist government
7 under the pretext that they supported santa anna a small group of texians armed themselves and overthrew the commander of the garrison that was enforcing the new customs duties
8 other settlers followed their example and within weeks all mexican soldiers in eastern texas had been forced to leave
9]buoyed by their military success texians organized a political convention to persuade mexican authorities to weaken the laws of april 6 1830
10 although the two municipalities with the largest tejano populations san antonio de béxar and victoria refused to participate 55 delegates met in october for the convention of 1832
11 they adopted a series of resolutions that requested changes in the governance of texas
the most controversial item was for texas to become an independent state separate from coahuila
10 after approving the list of resolutions delegates created a seven member central committee to convene future meetings
12]before the list of concerns could be presented to the state and federal governments ramón músquiz the political chief of the department of béxar ruled that the convention was illegal
13 the law directed that citizens should protest to their local ayuntamiento similar to a city council which would forward their concerns to the political chief
the political chief could then escalate the concerns to the appropriate governmental authority
11 because this process had not been followed músquiz annulled the resolutions
13]preparationthe previous convention 's lack of tejano representation fostered a perception that only newcomers to texas were dissatisfied
14
the president of the convention of 1832 stephen f. austin traveled to san antonio de béxar to garner support for the changes the convention had requested
austin found that the tejano leaders largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed
they urged patience bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from settlers who had recently sided with his rival santa anna
12]as a compromise the ayuntamiento of san antonio de béxar drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention 's resolutions
following legal norms they submitted this to músquiz who forwarded it to the mexican congress in early 1833
13 at this time the federal and state governments were in flux
bustamante had resigned the presidency in late december 1832 as part of a treaty to end the civil war
there was no effective state government
the governor of coahuila y tejas had died in september 1832 and his replacement federalist juan martín de veramendi immediately dissolved the state legislature which had centralist leanings
veramendi called elections to seat a new government in early 1833
15 due to the political uncertainty austin urged that the federal government be given several months to address the petition
if no action was eventually taken he advised that texas residents would form their own state government essentially declaring independence from coahuila if not from mexico
13]austin 's timeframe was endorsed by tejano leaders but it did not pacify the texian settlers
towards the end of december the central committee called for a new convention to meet in san felipe de austin in april 1833
note 1 elections were scheduled for march
15 this action disturbed the tejano leaders who saw it as a violation of their agreement with austin
16]communities in texas elected 56 delegates for the new convention
17 in a departure from the previous election san antonio de béxar also sent delegates including james bowie the son in law of governor veramendi
bowie like many of his fellow delegates was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change
18 the majority of the delegates to the previous convention had been more cautious
10]proceedingsthe convention of 1833 was called to order on april 1 1833 in san felipe de austin
by coincidence on that day santa anna was inaugurated as the new president of mexico
17 delegates elected william h. wharton a known hothead as president of the convention
18 wharton had lost his bid to be president of the previous convention
10][11 historian william c. davis describes wharton 's election as a public declaration that while austin was still respected his moderate course would no longer be followed
18]on the first day several delegates addressed the convention to justify the recent texian actions
many argued that the expulsion of most garrisons in the region was not an act of disloyalty to mexico but instead resistance to a particular form of governance
sam houston who represented nacogdoches commented that santa anna was only a name used as an excuse for resistance to oppression
19 several delegates argued that the recently concluded civil war had left mexico in too much turmoil to provide effective rule for texas
echoing the american revolution slogan no taxation without representation one delegate insisted that texas was not bound by mexican laws since its settlers had no representation
this delegate overlooked the fact that texas had been granted two representatives to the coahuila y tejas legislature
20]austin presented an overview of the events that had occurred in texas and in the rest of mexico over the previous year
he enumerated several grievances against the political and judicial systems and concluded that texas needed to become an independent state
this could be justified in his opinion by language in the constitution of 1824
20]state constitution by the second day of the convention delegates were in agreement to pursue separate statehood
austin wrote to a friend we are now able to sustain a state govt
and no country ever required one more than this
20 houston was named chairman of a committee to draft a new state constitution
although houston had not lived in texas for very long he was well known having served as governor of tennessee and as a member of the united states congress
20]the new constitution was based on a copy of the 1780 massachusetts constitution provided by one of the committee members
17 the proposed document also drew from the constitutions of other states in the united states including louisiana missouri and tennessee
it provided meticulous detail for the new system of government
21
the executive branch structure proposed by austin,[22 called for a governor who would serve two year terms
the state would have a bicameral legislature and a three tier judiciary system with local and district courts ultimately kept in check by a state supreme court
23]a 27 article bill of rights,[23 containing according to historian howard miller an impressive list of protected rights,[21 was included
this document aligned closely with contemporary american political ideals especially the notion that all men had a right to liberty
much of the language and concepts were drawn from the first eight amendments to the united states constitution
24 the document called for trial by jury a distinct departure from mexican law which required that trials be heard by the local alcalde
23 defendants would be granted counsel and would have the right to examine any evidence against them
they would be protected from excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishments
civil authorities would take priority over military authorities
25 delegates also agreed to protect free communication of thoughts and opinions",[26 a phrase carefully drafted to imply freedom of speech of assembly and of the press
although it could also be interpreted to imply freedom of religion,[21 delegates were unwilling to explicitly grant that right knowing that it would cause an uproar in catholic mexico
note 2][23]a few of the rights were drawn from spanish practices
24 the proposed constitution forbade the english practices of primogeniture and entailment following a change made to spanish law in 1821
delegates retained the traditional spanish prohibition against seizing a debtor 's physical property[27 and extended it to forbid imprisonment as a punishment for debt
this was a novel idea
25 in the united states nine states had enumerated certain conditions under which a debtor could not be imprisoned but no state had an unqualified prohibition on the practice
25]borrowing from the resolutions of the convention of 1832,[10 delegates wrote into the constitution a guarantee of free public education
they further banned unsecured paper currency and insisted the state economy should be based solely on hard currency
23 when the constitution was completed david g. burnet headed a subcommittee to craft a letter to mexican authorities to explain the merits of the proposal
23]resolutionsin addition to the development of a state constitution delegates passed a series of resolutions that asked mexican authorities for reforms
several of these echoed resolutions passed at the previous year 's convention
delegates again insisted that the ban on immigration should be repealed and that customs duties be lifted
resolutions also requested additional protection from raids by native tribes and that the government implement a more efficient mail delivery system
10][23]one of the resolutions would have been more suited for passage by a state legislature than a group of concerned citizens
perhaps to atone for some of the more revolutionary items they had requested as one of their final acts delegates passed a resolution that condemned the slave trade within texas
23 the constitution of 1824 had already abolished the slave trade and the constitution of coahuila y tejas had forbidden the importation of slaves into the state
most settlers in texas ignored the restrictions and instead converted their slaves to servants indentured for 99 years
29 african slaves were still imported into texas occasionally and a ship carrying slaves docked in galveston bay as the convention met
this ship like most others used to import slaves came from cuba which was a possession of spain
because spain did not officially recognize mexican independence delegates considered this trade treasonous to mexico
30]delegates ordered that the resolution be printed in newspapers in the mexican interior and in new orleans
30 it was not printed in texas,[note 3 clearly indicating that it was intended to influence public opinion in the mexican interior rather than in texas
31 the resolution was not binding and slaves continued to be imported to texas through cuba
30]despite a vocal minority advocating for the unilateral implementation of the proposals delegates agreed to present the requests to the mexican congress for approval
they did agree to take action if it appeared their demands would be ignored
31 as their last act delegates elected austin james miller and erasmo seguín to deliver their petitions to mexico city
seguin a prominent citizen of san antonio de béxar had not attended the convention
delegates hoped austin could persuade seguin to accompany him thus implying that tejanos supported the resolutions
31]preparations for delivery when the convention adjourned on april 13 austin went directly to san antonio de béxar to meet with seguin
31 seguin called a series of meetings held from may 3 to 5 for prominent locals to discuss the convention proceedings
he was the only béxar resident to fully support separate statehood
32 other residents suggested that the capital of coahuila y tejas should be moved to san antonio de béxar giving texas more power
there was precedent for this under veramendi the capital had just been moved from saltillo to monclova
if the legislature rejected the move these residents vowed to support separate statehood
33]a third group of residents believed that the convention like its predecessor was illegal
under their interpretation of the laws only the state legislature would be able to petition the mexican congress for such a drastic change
33 austin argued that the laws really meant that no one could petition on behalf of the people unless the people had been consulted and the convention served as that consultation
the meetings ended with no agreement on how to proceed
34 austin wrote that the people here agree in substance with the rest of texas but differ as to the manner and will express no opinion for nor against
35]seguin declined to accompany austin
miller also withdrew
33 texas was in the throes of a cholera epidemic and miller a physician felt it his duty to stay and tend the sick
36 austin then visited goliad but was unable to attract any more tejano support
37
he chose to go to mexico city alone he had visited several times and had established a good reputation among government officials
although he was warned that his reception would likely be poor he ignored suggestions to delay his journey
36]receptionwithin the mexican interior rumors abounded that texas was on the verge of revolution
many citizens in matamoros believed texians had already declared independence and were raising an army
santa anna was infuriated especially at the involvement of houston a former officer in the united states military
36]immediately after santa anna had taken office in april he had handed over all decision making authority to his vice president valentín gómez farías and retired to the countryside
farías enacted many federalist reforms which angered citizens and army leaders
38 much of the country was clamoring for a return to centralism yet texians wanted to take further steps toward self rule
39 by the time austin arrived in mexico city on july 18 several mexican states had engaged in minor revolts against farías 's reforms
although texians had expelled troops within their province before santa anna and farías took office many officials identified the province with the other rebellious states and were suspicious of austin 's intentions
39]the cholera epidemic reached mexico city within days of austin 's arrival prompting congress to adjourn before austin could present the convention 's resolutions
as he waited for the legislature to reconvene austin heard rumors that texians were planning a third convention to unilaterally declare themselves a separate state
39
although austin was also frustrated at the lack of progress he disapproved of this drastic proposal
in an attempt to quell the more radical groups in texas in october austin sent a letter to the ayuntamiento in san antonio de béxar in which he proposed that all of the ayuntamientos should jointly form a new state government
40
in what could be interpreted as an inflammatory gesture austin signed his letter dios y tejas god and texas rather than the traditional mexican closing dios y libertad god and liberty
41 a few days after he had posted the letter the immigration ban was repealed assuaging one of the major texian concerns
40]austin had expected the letter to reach his friend músquiz who could be trusted to determine when or if it was appropriate to publicly disclose its contents
the letter arrived while músquiz was out of town and was read by an unsympathetic ayuntamiento member
42 at this member 's request the ayuntamiento of san antonio de béxar forwarded the letter to state officials in coahuila
43
the new governor,[note 4 francisco vidaurri y villaseñor ordered austin 's arrest
44 austin was arrested in december on suspicion of treason
43 he was imprisoned through all of 1834 and remained in mexico city on bond until july 1835
34]during austin 's imprisonment the government addressed several more of the convention 's proposals
at santa anna 's urging the coahuila y
tejas legislature enacted several measures to placate the texians
in early 1834 texas gained an additional seat in the state legislature
45 an american immigrant was named state attorney general and for the first time foreigners were granted explicit permission to participate in retail trade
46 several american legal concepts including trial by jury were introduced to texas and english was authorized as a second language
45 finally the state created four new municipalities in texas matagorda san augustine bastrop and san patricio
46
in a letter to a friend austin wrote every evil complained of has been remedied
this fully compensates me for all i have suffered
