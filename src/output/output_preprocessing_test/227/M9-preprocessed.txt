in 1815 he was a captain adjutant major in the tenth legion of the national guard of the seine
on the restoration of bourbon rule in france woll sailed for america carrying letters of introduction to gen. winfield scott headquartered in baltimore maryland
scott apparently pointed to the opportunities that the mexican revolutionary movement in progress against spain offered a young man of energy skilled in the military arts
on july 3 1816 in baltimore woll joined the staff of gen. francisco xavier mina as a lieutenant colonel
he landed with mina near the mouth of the santander river on april 15 1817 and assisted in seizing soto la marina three days later

in 1836 woll was quartermaster general of santa anna 's army in the invasion of texas
on march 8 he reached san antonio de béxar and reported to gen. vicente filisola second in command of the mexican forces
after the battle of the alamo woll accompanied gen. joaquín ramírez y sesma who had orders to march with 725 men through gonzales to san felipe de austin and thence to harrisburg and anahuac
the force included three infantry battalions two six pounder cannons and forty dragoons
ramírez y sesma confronted gen. sam houston and a texan army on the opposite bank of the colorado river at beeson 's ferry near the site of present day columbus and began crossing
houston retreated
on april 5 when santa anna reached atascosito pass on the colorado woll assigned a battalion to construct rafts to ferry across the remainder of the army which was arriving under filisola
santa anna then proceeded with a division to san felipe and defeat at the battle of san jacinto
on april 26 woll became filisola 's chief of staff
informed of santa anna 's surrender filisola dispatched woll to the texan camp as an emissary under the pretext of learning the terms of the armistice but actually to gain information on the strength armament and resources of the enemy
on april 30 woll rode in under a truce flag and was detained
gen. thomas j. rusk commanding the texan army transferred woll to velasco where he was given safe conduct to goliad and released
woll joined the retreating mexican army on june 12
in 1842 woll claimed that during the texas campaign he had persuaded santa anna to cancel his order to shoot james w. fannin and his men but the order could not be recalled in time
after the texas revolution woll played an inconspicuous role in mexican affairs
during the brief pastry war with france in 1838–39 he resigned his commission to avoid fighting against his countrymen but the mexican government rejected his request and placed him on inactive duty
when the french troops withdrew woll joined santa anna and the centralists in their struggle with the federalists
late in november 1840 he went to new orleans and negotiated for military supplies and other items some of which may have been involved in a smuggling operation conducted by his wife at saltillo
in december woll was assigned to service on the northern frontier
in early june 1842 woll was appointed second in command to isidro reyes in the army of the north and made head of the department of coahuila
during the summer he received orders to invade texas see mexican invasions of 1842
woll was to capture san antonio then reconnoiter the guadalupe river down to gonzales all within one month
he had crossed the rio grande at presidio with his second division by august 30 and following a new route entered san antonio on september 11

woll was arrested and imprisoned but freed under a general amnesty decree of may 24 1845
earlier while commanding on the frontier he had served with a government commission to arrange an armistice between mexico and texas
james w. robinson a texan prisoner at perote prison had offered proposals to settle the differences between the two countries and santa anna allowed robinson to return to texas and present his case
houston declared a truce on june 15 1843
the commissioners of both governments signed an armistice on february 15 1844 at salinas on the rio grande
however the mexican government quickly recalled its commissioners upon learning that the texans were negotiating in washington for annexation to the united states and that the texas commissioners had no authority to discuss a permanent peace
on june 19 woll on instructions from mexico city sent houston a formal declaration of war and hostilities resumed
during the united states invasion of mexico in 1846 woll served in the mexican army until santa anna 's defeat in 1847 then sailed for europe
in 1852 he landed in havana cuba and joined santa anna on his return to mexico
on april 20 1853 at santa anna 's installation as president he appointed woll governor and commandant general of tamaulipas
when revolutionary disturbances flared his authority was extended over nuevo león and coahuila
santa anna declared himself a dictator on december 16 1853 but his support faded and he fled mexico
woll also left
about three and a half years later woll reappeared in mexico as an adherent of president miguel miramón whose centralist regime had been attacked by benito juárez and the constitutionalists
on march 22 1859 woll landed at mocambo with several prominent reactionists díaz de la vega victor blanco and two sons of santa anna reported to miramón at veragra and was given an army command
during the ensuing guerra de la reforma he defeated gen. s. degollado a liberal leader on august 30 near león and occupied zacatecas in november

the group chose three mexican citizens to act as a temporary executive and selected 215 citizens to serve as an asamblea de notables appointed on june 29 1863 the asamblea met jointly with the junta superior and formed a monarchy
the executive committee called the regencia del imperio mexicano sent woll and eleven others as a deputation to offer the mexican imperial crown to archduke ferdinand maximilian of austria

when maximilian became displeased with marshal françois achille bazaine and demanded his recall he dispatched woll in the fall of 1865 to explain matters to napoleon
woll learned that napoleon planned to withdraw the french troops from mexico beginning in january 1866 and he never returned to mexico
the french soldier of fortune died at montauban just north of toulouse in southern france in february 1875
battle of salado creek
following brig
gen. rafael vásquez 's raid on san antonio in march 1842 texan volunteers gathered in that city to launch a retaliatory raid into mexico
the release and repatriation of the texan santa fe expedition prisoners however was considered a gesture of peace and good will from the mexican government causing president sam houston to withdraw his sanction from the planned incursion
the diplomats visions of peace however were shattered within a month when the mexican army struck again carrying off a larger scale version of the vásquez raid
that fall brig
gen. adrián woll a french soldier of fortune serving in the mexican army crossed the rio grande with 1,000 regular infantry 500 irregular cavalry and two pieces of artillery and on september 11 entered san antonio
in response approximately 200 volunteers from gonzales seguin and other lower colorado river settlements marched under capt mathew caldwell to the east bank of salado creek seven miles from san antonio
there they united with capt john c. hays 's fourteen man ranger company that had been driven from the city with woll 's approach
caldwell wishing to precipitate a fight but not strong enough to attack the mexicans in san antonio dispatched hays 's men into the town at sunrise on september 18 to draw out the enemy
if woll could be lured into the open prairie caldwell reasoned the texans although outnumbered expected to give a good account of themselves from their fine defensive position in the bed of salado creek
only thirty eight horses in the texan camp were fit for duty thus only thirty eight men could go into bexar as decoys
hays accompanied by henry e. mc culloch william a. a. bigfoot wallace robert a. gillespie and thirty four other texans arrived a mile from the city between nine and ten o'clock in the morning dismounted and prepared an ambush
hays and mc culloch then remounted and taking six men with them boldly ventured to within half a mile of the alamo taunting the mexican cavalry to come out and fight
hays had hoped to be pursued by about forty or fifty mexicans
instead 400 to 500 cavalrymen chased them toward the salado
woll had just completed preparations to move against caldwell and when hays and mc culloch made their appearance woll 's whole force of cavalry was already in the saddle ready to give chase
woll said he would go in person and drive the texian wolves from the bushes
 he accordingly rode out with nearly his whole force including a large number of the mexican residents of bexar to attack caldwell 's position
as hays mc culloch and their half dozen companions approached the texans hiding in ambush hays ordered them to mount and fall back
the rangers fell back briskly across the mesquite covered prairie toward caldwell 's position where their comrades were camped among the cottonwoods cedars and live oaks of the creek bottom
for the first four miles the texans with the advantage of a lead of one half a mile kept out of reach of the mexican cavalry without much difficulty
too soon however the fresh horses captured by woll on the eleventh began to gain on the somewhat jaded mounts of the rangers
as the mexicans gained ground the texans threw off blankets hats and raincoats in an attempt to lighten their horses loads
mcculloch commanding the rear guard of ten picked men pressed close upon the heels of the foremost rangers
the race wrote reverend z. n. morrell was an earnest one
 the mexicans made a desperate effort to cut off hays by passing his right flank
mcculloch kept between him and the mexicans sending couriers every half mile or so urging hays to put for the timber and finally when the timber was reached mc culloch had only one man with him creed taylor
these two had been targets for the mexicans for the last half mile at a range of 150 to 200 yards
from 100 to 200 shots were fired at them on the run but not a ball struck man or horse
the men in camp had slaughtered a beef that morning and were engaged in cooking and eating when hays 's men dashed in closely pursued by mexican cavalry
the texans ruse however had its desired effect
the battle was joined on terrain favorable to the texans
every man was soon at his post and ready for action
the enemy crossed the salado above us wrote miles s. bennet and took a position several hundred yards to the east
at about 10:00 a.m. woll 's entire command estimated to be 1,500 men formed and maintained continuous fire recalled n. b. burkett but on account of the distance we did not pay a great deal of attention to them
 caldwell sent out a typically confident call for help
the enemy are around me on every side but i fear them not he wrote to the men of the nearby settlements
vowing to hold his position until reinforced old paint invited the texans to join in the sport
it is the most favorable opportunity i have seen he assured his neighbors
i can whip them on any ground without help but can not take prisoners
why do n't you come hurra for texas
 throughout the day caldwell 's men continued to circle their positions making themselves conspicuous so that their fighting force might appear to be greater in number to the enemy
after a day of desultory skirmishing and artillery and small arms fire the mexican right and left wings attacked leaving a clear field of fire open through their center to play with their cannon
 we whipped them in about fifteen minutes wrote burkett shooting some of them down within twenty steps of our lines
 among the slain was vicente córdova leader of the abortive rebellion of 1838
after this according to thomas jefferson green woll used every persuasion to make his men charge the texians but to no purpose
the texian rifle when directed by steady nerves was awfully destructive
 as the night came on and the firing ceased woll retired from the field
in the day 's fighting the mexicans reportedly lost sixty men killed and many more wounded while only one texan was killed and nine to twelve were wounded
most of the texas volunteers were eager to counterattack and free the prisoners held within woll 's lines
while texan arms were enjoying success on the salado a tragedy was transpiring not far away
in response to woll 's invasion capt nicholas m. dawson had raised a fifty three man company and marched down from la grange
nearing caldwell 's embattled line on the eighteenth it was intercepted by a column of several hundred irregular mexican cavalry supported by a battery of two field pieces
after a spirited but futile resistance that saw half of the command cut down by artillery fire dawson 's men began to surrender
once the texans were disarmed however the mexicans again fired upon them
two escaped and fifteen were marched away to perote prison in mexico
of these men only nine would survive to return to texas see dawson massacre
unfortunately for the texan cause a hard rain fell all of the next day and consequently no advance was made
about midnight several of the texans entered the mexicans camp to engage in a little ` sport and found that woll had stolen a trick from george washington 's book by burning his camp fires and had evacuated the city under cover of darkness
on learning that the mexicans had begun their retreat the texans followed but were halted for the night by the muddy crossing of the medina river below san antonio
no further contact was made with the retreating mexicans until woll was overtaken at the crossing of the hondo river by hays 's company riding half a mile in advance of caldwell 's main army
pressing rapidly forward about 3:00 p.m. the rangers came up with woll 's rear guard strongly positioned and supported by a battery commanding the road from the north
with no knowledge of the artillery 's presence hays charged the mexican rear guard driving it back upon woll 's main force and overrunning the guns before the enemy had fired half a dozen rounds
the boldness of the charge took the mexican army by surprise no doubt saving hays 's command many casualties
hays 's horse was shot from under him but only two of his men were wounded
woll discovering that the rangers were supported neither by infantry nor artillery rallied and recaptured the battery severely outnumbered the texans fell back three or four hundred yards into a dry creek bed where caldwell 's main body joined them and began to fortify the position in anticipation of another mexican attack
among the texan officers however a heated difference of opinion arose as to the practicability of successfully attacking the enemy
the usually aggressive caldwell held a council of war and more time was lost in discussing the situation
mcculloch came to the front and called for volunteers to advance and judge john hemphill urged the importance of an immediate attack
but according to john holland jenkins a lethargy had fallen upon the command that effectually retarded further progress
 as night approached on the 22nd the texans stood in their ranks suffering for water and tantalized almost to madness by the delay and want of harmony among our leaders
 at three o'clock next morning woll hustled his troops across the hondo and force marched them toward the rio grande
at this point pursuit by the texans was abandoned
the fall of 1842 had been exceptionally rainy and the rivers between san antonio and the rio grande were experiencing an unwonted flow
had the command held together continued its harassment of the retreating mexicans and awaited the arrival of the squads and companies of volunteers already on their way to the army bennet believed woll 's army could have been destroyed before it reached mexican soil
as it was caldwell 's volunteers returned from the hondo deprived of their showdown fight with woll 's command
only a few miles up the road toward san antonio they met the vanguard of edward burleson arriving with reinforcements
green spoke for the army when he observed that general burleson may not be considered a tactician in the strict sense of the term but he never failed to observe one rule in winning battles more important than all the minutiae of the drill that rule is to fight
 dawson massacre
after the capture of san antonio on september 11 1842 by brig
gen. adrián woll in the second of the mexican invasions of 1842 texan forces gathered on salado creek under col mathew caldwell to repel the raiders
while texas arms were succeeding at the battle of salado creek on september 18 1842 a calamity was occurring only a mile and a half away
in response to caldwell 's call for volunteers capt nicholas m. dawson had raised a fifty three man company mostly from fayette county and marched down from la grange
believing caldwell 's forces to be in grave danger dawson 's men chose not to wait for capt jesse billingsley 's company which was following them but to disregard the threat posed by numerous heavy mexican cavalry patrols and to fight their way to the salado
near caldwell 's embattled line between 3 and 4 p.m. on the eighteenth the company was intercepted by a column of 500 irregular mexican cavalry commanded by colonels cayetano montero josé maría carrasco and pedro rangel and supported by a battery of two field pieces
according to the accounts of several survivors the mexican column was commanded by juan nepomuceno seguín but they were no doubt in error
dawson dismounted his men in a mesquite thicket where fort sam houston now stands and threatened to shoot the first man who runs
 the texans were quickly surrounded but repulsed a spirited cavalry charge and inflicted a number of casualties on the enemy
the mexicans then fell back out of rifle range and opened fire on the texans with their artillery
billingsley 's company which arrived while the fight was in progress was too weak to go to dawson 's aid and caldwell 's men on salado creek were heavily engaged throughout the afternoon
montero once more ordered his cavalry then dismounted to charge
after a vigorous but futile resistance the severely wounded dawson sought to surrender
the mexicans continued to fire however striking dawson several more times
seeing surrender to be impossible he gasped out his dying words let victory be purchased with blood
 alsey s. miller took up the white mackinaw that dawson had waved in token of surrender and rode with it toward the mexican lines only to be fired upon in his turn
miller then galloped through the enemy toward the town of seguin
henry gonzalvo woods after witnessing the death of his father and the mortal wounding of his brother norman also escaped
some of the texans continued to resist while others laid down their arms
heroic in the fight was griffin a slave of samuel a. maverick who his rifle shattered fought on with the limb of a mesquite tree until he was killed
by 5 p.m. the fight was over
thirty six texans died on the field fifteen were taken prisoner and two escaped
the prisoners were marched away to perote prison in mexico
of these men only nine survived to return to texas
thirty mexicans were estimated to have been killed and between sixty and seventy wounded
two days later the mexican army retreated toward the rio grande and the dawson men were buried in shallow graves in the mesquite thicket where they fell
mexican invasions of 1842
because of mexico 's refusal to recognize the independence of texas after the treaties of velasco the republic was in constant fear of a mexican invasion
the fear assumed reality on january 9 1842 when gen. mariano arista issued a statement from monterrey telling the texans that it was hopeless for them to continue their struggle for independence and promising amnesty and protection to all who remained neutral during his planned invasion
early in march goliad refugio and victoria were occupied and on march 5 the mexican troops under rafael vásquez appeared before san antonio
the texans retreated leaving the town to the mexicans because john c. hays found it impossible to gather enough men to make a defense immediately
the militia under alexander somervell was called out however and gathered at san antonio on march 15 but the mexican forces had abandoned the town on march 9 edward burleson the leader of the volunteers had no orders to follow the invaders so the texan force remained in san antonio until it was disbanded on april 2
the most unfortunate result of the raid was the panic that it caused in the western settlements
on march 10 president sam houston declared a national emergency and ordered the archives removed to houston but the people of austin refused to let the records be taken
when houston issued a second order on december 10 the struggle known as the archive war resulted
meanwhile houston had made an appeal to the united states for money and volunteers and adjutant general james davisqv was sent to corpus christi to organize volunteers with orders to hold them until the time was opportune for an invasion of mexico
on june 7 davis 's forces had a skirmish with antonio canales rosillo but canales soon retired to mexico
during the session of the texas congress that met on june 27 ten million acres of land was appropriated to finance a war of invasion against mexico but the bill was vetoed by houston
davis 's forces were dismissed and texas was left undefended
on september 11 1842 gen. adrián woll with a force of 1,200 mexicans captured san antonio
by september 17 200 texans had gathered on cibolo creek above seguin and marched under mathew caldwell to salado creek six miles northeast of san antonio
on september 18 caldwell sent hays and a company of scouts to draw the mexicans into a fight the battle of salado creek resulted
while the fight was going on capt nicholas m. dawson approached from the east with a company of fifty three men
these men were attacked a mile and a half from the scene of the battle and killed in what came to be known as the dawson massacre
woll drew his men back to san antonio and retreated to mexico by september 20
the reinforced texans pursued him for three days and then returned to san antonio
by september 25 a large number of texans had gathered at san antonio and plans were made for a punitive expedition the somervell expedition which evolved into the mier expedition
