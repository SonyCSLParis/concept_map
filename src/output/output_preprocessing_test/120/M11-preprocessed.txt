1933–1984)partner lady elizabeth cavendish(1951–1984)children paul betjeman candida lycett green sir john betjeman cbe /'b?t m?n/ 28 august 1906 19 may 1984 was an english poet writer and broadcaster who described himself in who 's who as a poet and hack
he was poet laureate of the united kingdom from 1972 until his death
he was a founding member of the victorian society and a passionate defender of victorian architecture
he began his career as a journalist and ended it as one of the most popular british poets laureate and a much loved figure on british television
lifeearly life and education betjeman was born john betjemann
his parents mabel née dawson and ernest betjemann had a family firm at 34–42 pentonville road which manufactured the kind of ornamental household furniture and gadgets distinctive to victorians
1]he changed his name to the less german looking betjeman during the first world war
his father 's forebears had actually come from the present day netherlands and had ironically added the extra -n during the fourth anglo dutch war to avoid the anti dutch sentiment existing at the time[2 more than a century earlier setting up their home and business in islington london
betjeman was baptised at st anne 's church highgate rise a 19th century church at the foot of highgate west hill
the family lived at parliament hill mansions in the lissenden gardens private estate in highgate in north london
in 1909 the betjemanns moved half a mile north to more opulent highgate
from west hill they lived in the reflected glory of the burdett coutts estate:"here from my eyrie as the sun went down i heard the old north london puff and shunt glad that i did not live in gospel oak

3]betjeman 's early schooling was at the local byron house and highgate school where he was taught by poet t. s. eliot
after this he boarded at the dragon school preparatory school in north oxford and marlborough college a public school in wiltshire
in his penultimate year he joined the secret society of amici'[4 in which he was a contemporary of both louis mac neice and graham shepard
he founded the heretick a satirical magazine that lampooned marlborough 's obsession with sport
while at school his exposure to the works of arthur machen won him over to high church anglicanism a conversion of importance to his later writing and conception of the arts
5]magdalen college oxford betjeman entered the university of oxford with difficulty having failed the mathematics portion of the university 's matriculation exam responsions
he was however admitted as a commoner i.e. a non scholarship student at magdalen college and entered the newly created school of english language and literature
at oxford betjeman made little use of the academic opportunities
his tutor a young c. s. lewis regarded him as an idle prig and betjeman in turn considered lewis unfriendly demanding and uninspired as a teacher
6 betjeman particularly disliked the coursework 's emphasis on linguistics and dedicated most of his time to cultivating his social life his interest in english ecclesiastical architecture and to private literary pursuits
at oxford he was a friend of maurice bowra later 1938 to 1970 to be warden of wadham
betjeman had a poem published in isis the university magazine and served as editor of the cherwell student newspaper during 1927
his first book of poems was privately printed with the help of fellow student edward james
he famously brought his teddy bear archibald ormsby gore up to magdalen with him the memory of which inspired his oxford contemporary evelyn waugh to include sebastian flyte 's teddy aloysius in brideshead revisited much of this period of his life is recorded in his blank verse autobiography summoned by bells published in 1960 and made into a television film in 1976
7]it is a common misapprehension cultivated by betjeman himself that he did not complete his degree because he failed to pass the compulsory holy scripture examination known colloquially as divvers short for divinity
in hilary term 1928 betjeman failed divinity for the second time
he had to leave the university for the trinity term to prepare for a retake of the exam he was then allowed to return in october
betjeman then wrote to the secretary of the tutorial board at magdalen g. c. lee asking to be entered for the pass school a set of examinations taken on rare occasions by undergraduates who are deemed unlikely to achieve an honours degree
in summoned by bells betjeman claims that his tutor c. s. lewis said you 'd have only got a third but he had informed the tutorial board that he thought betjeman would not achieve an honours degree of any class
6]permission to sit the pass school was granted
betjeman famously decided to offer a paper in welsh
osbert lancaster tells the story that a tutor came by train twice a week first class from aberystwyth to teach betjeman
however jesus college had a number of welsh tutors who more probably would have taught him
betjeman finally had to leave at the end of the michaelmas term 1928
8 betjeman did pass his divinity examination on his third try but was sent down after failing the pass school
he had achieved a satisfactory result in only one of the three required papers on shakespeare and other english authors
6 betjeman 's academic failure at oxford rankled with him for the rest of his life and he was never reconciled with c.s. lewis towards whom he nursed a bitter detestation
this situation was perhaps complicated by his enduring love of oxford from which he accepted an honorary doctorate of letters in 1974
6]after university the john betjeman centre memorabilia room showing the office from his home in trebetherick betjeman left oxford without a degree
whilst there however he had made the acquaintance of people who would later influence his work including louis mac neice and w. h. auden
9 he worked briefly as a private secretary school teacher and film critic for the evening standard where he also wrote for their high society gossip column the londoner 's diary
he was employed by the architectural review between 1930 and 1935 as a full time assistant editor following their publishing of some of his freelance work
timothy mowl 2000 says his years at the architectural review were to be his true university
10 at this time while his prose style matured he joined the mars group an organisation of young modernist architects and architectural critics in britain
betjeman 's sexuality can best be described as bisexual but his longest and best documented relationships were with women and a fairer analysis of his sexuality may be that he was the hatcher of a lifetime of schoolboy crushes both gay and straight most of which progressed no further
11 nevertheless he has been considered temperamentally gay and even became a penpal of lord alfred bosie douglas of oscar wilde fame
12 on 29 july 1933 he married the hon
penelope chetwode the daughter of field marshal lord chetwode
the couple lived in berkshire and had a son paul in 1937
their daughter candida was born in 1942
the shell guides were developed by betjeman and jack beddington a friend who was publicity manager with shell mex ltd to guide britain 's growing number of motorists around the counties of britain and their historical sites
they were published by the architectural press and financed by shell
by the start of world war ii 13 had been published of which cornwall 1934 and devon 1936 were written by betjeman
a third shropshire was written with and designed by his good friend john piper in 1951
in 1939 betjeman was rejected for active service in world war ii but found war work with the films division of the ministry of information
in 1941 he became british press attaché in neutral dublin ireland working with sir john maffey
he may have been involved with the gathering of intelligence
he is reported to have been selected for assassination by the ira
the order was rescinded after a meeting with an unnamed old ira man who was impressed by his works
betjeman wrote a number of poems based on his experiences in emergency world war ii ireland including the irish unionist 's farewell to greta hellstrom in 1922 written during the war which contained the refrain dungarvan in the rain
the object of his affections greta has remained a mystery until recently revealed to have been a member of a well known west waterford ascendancy family
his official brief included establishing friendly contacts with leading figures in the dublin literary scene he befriended patrick kavanagh then at the very start of his career
kavanagh celebrated the birth of betjeman 's daughter with a poem candida another well known poem contains the line let john betjeman call for me in a car
after world war iibetjeman 's house on cloth fair in the city of london
betjeman 's wife penelope became a roman catholic in 1948
the couple drifted apart and in 1951 he met lady elizabeth cavendish with whom he developed an immediate and lifelong friendship
by 1948 betjeman had published more than a dozen books
five of these were verse collections including one in the usa
sales of his collected poems in 1958 reached 100,000
13 the popularity of the book prompted ken russell to make a film about him john betjeman a poet in london 1959
filmed in 35 mm and running 11 minutes and 35 seconds it was first shown on bbc 's monitor programme
14]he continued writing guidebooks and works on architecture during the 1960s and 1970s and started broadcasting
he was a founder member of the victorian society 1958
betjeman was closely associated with the culture and spirit of metro land as outer reaches of the metropolitan railway were known before the war
in 1973 he made a widely acclaimed television documentary for the bbc called metro land directed by edward mirzoeff
on the centenary of betjeman 's birth in 2006 his daughter led two celebratory railway trips from london to bristol and through metro land to quainton road
in 1974 betjeman and mirzoeff followed up metro land with a passion for churches a celebration of betjeman 's beloved church of england filmed entirely in the diocese of norwich
in 1975 he proposed that the fine rooms of somerset house should house the turner bequest so helping to scupper the plan of the minister for the arts for a theatre museum to be housed there
in 1977 the bbc broadcast the queen 's realm a prospect of england an aerial anthology of english landscape music and poetry selected by betjeman and produced by edward mirzoeff in celebration of the queen 's silver jubilee
betjeman was fond of the ghost stories of m.r. james and supplied an introduction to peter haining 's book m.r. james book of the supernatural
he was susceptible to the supernatural
diana mitford tells the story of betjeman staying at her country home biddesden house in the 1920s
she says he had a terrifying dream that he was handed a card with wide black edges and on it his name was engraved and a date
he knew this was the date of his death
15]john betjeman 's grave for the last decade of his life betjeman suffered increasingly from parkinson 's disease
he died at his home in trebetherick cornwall on 19 may 1984 aged 77 and is buried nearby at st enodoc 's church
16]poetrybetjeman 's poems are often humorous and in broadcasting he exploited his bumbling and fogeyish image
his wryly comic verse is accessible and has attracted a great following for its satirical and observant grace
auden said in his introduction to slick but not streamlined so at home with the provincial gaslit towns the seaside lodgings the bicycle the harmonium
 his poetry is similarly redolent of time and place continually seeking out intimations of the eternal in the manifestly ordinary
there are constant evocations of the physical chaff and clutter that accumulates in everyday life the miscellanea of an england now gone but not beyond the reach of living memory
he talks of ovaltine and sturmey archer bicycle gears
oh fuller 's angel cake robertson 's marmalade he writes liberty lampshades come shine on us all
 17]in a 1962 radio interview he told teenage questioners that he could not write about abstract things preferring places and faces
18 philip larkin wrote of his work how much more interesting worth writing about betjeman 's subjects are than most other modern poets i mean whether so and so achieves some metaphysical inner unity is not really so interesting to us as the overbuilding of rural middlesex
19]betjeman was a practising anglican and his religious beliefs come through in some of his poems
he combined piety with a nagging uncertainty about the truth of christianity
unlike thomas hardy who disbelieved in the truth of the christmas story while hoping it might be so betjeman affirms his belief even while fearing it might be false
5 in the poem christmas one of his most openly religious pieces the last three stanzas that proclaim the wonder of christ 's birth do so in the form of a question and is it true
 his views on christianity were expressed in his poem the conversion of st. paul a response to a radio broadcast by humanist margaret knight but most of us turn slow to see the figure hanging on a tree and stumble on and blindly grope upheld by intermittent hope god grant before we die we all may see the light as did st. paul
betjeman became poet laureate of the united kingdom in 1972 the first knight bachelor to be appointed the only other sir william davenant had been knighted after his appointment
this role combined with his popularity as a television performer ensured that his poetry reached an audience enormous by the standards of the time
similarly to tennyson he appealed to a wide public and managed to voice the thoughts and aspirations of many ordinary people while retaining the respect of many of his fellow poets
this is partly because of the apparently simple traditional metrical structures and rhymes he uses
20 in the early 1970s he began a recording career of four albums on charisma records which included betjeman 's banana blush 1974 and late flowering love 1974 where his poetry reading is set to music with overdubbing by leading musicians of the time
21 his recording catalogue extends to nine albums four singles and two compilations

john betjeman reads william horton 's petition to save lewisham town hall 1961 betjeman had a fondness for victorian architecture and was a founding member of victorian society

he led the campaign to save holy trinity sloane street in london when it was threatened with demolition in the early 1970s
22]he fought a spirited but unsuccessful campaign to save the propylaeum known commonly as the euston arch london
he is considered instrumental in helping to save st pancras railway station london and was commemorated when it became an international terminus for eurostar in november 2007
he called the plan to demolish st pancras a criminal folly
23 about it he wrote what the londoner sees in his mind 's eye is that cluster of towers and pinnacles seen from pentonville hill and outlined against a foggy sunset and the great arc of barlow 's train shed gaping to devour incoming engines and the sudden burst of exuberant gothic of the hotel seen from gloomy judd street
 24]on the reopening of st pancras station in 2007 a statue of betjeman was commissioned from curators futurecity
a proposal by artist martin jennings was selected from a shortlist
the finished work was erected in the station at platform level including a series of slate roundels depicting selections of betjeman 's writings
23]betjeman was given the remaining two year lease on victorian gothic architect william burges 's tower house in holland park upon leaseholder mrs e.r.b. graham 's death in 1962
25 betjeman felt he could not afford the financial implications of taking over the house permanently with his potential liability for £ 10,000 of renovations upon the expiration of the lease
25 after damage from vandals restoration began in 1966
betjeman 's lease included furniture from the house by burges and betjeman gave three pieces the zodiac settle the narcissus washstand and the philosophy cabinet to evelyn waugh
26]betjeman responded to architecture as the visible manifestation of society 's spiritual life as well as its political and economic structure
he attacked speculators and bureaucrats for what he saw as their rapacity and lack of imagination
in the preface of his collection of architectural essays first and last loves he says we accept the collapse of the fabrics of our old churches the thieving of lead and objects from them the commandeering and butchery of our scenery by the services the despoiling of landscaped parks and the abandonment to a fate worse than the workhouse of our country houses because we are convinced we must save money
 in a bbc film made in 1968 but not broadcast at that time betjeman described the sound of leeds to be of victorian buildings crashing to the ground
he went on to lambast john poulson 's british railways house now city house saying how it blocked all the light out to city square and was only a testament to money with no architectural merit
he also praised the architecture of leeds town hall
27][28 in 1969 betjeman contributed the foreword to derek linstrum 's historic architecture of leeds
29]betjeman was for over 20 years a trustee of the bath preservation trust and was vice president from 1965 to 1971 at a time when bath a city rich in georgian architecture came under increasing pressure from modern developers and a proposed major road to cut across the city
30 he also created a short television documentary called architecture of bath in which he voiced his concerns about the way the city 's architectural heritage was being mis treated
legacya memorial window designed by john piper in all saints church farnborough berkshire where betjeman lived in the nearby rectory
the betjeman millennium park at wantage in oxfordshire where he lived from 1951 to 1972 and where he set his book archie and the strict baptists one of the roads in pinner a town covered in betjeman 's film metro land is called betjeman close
