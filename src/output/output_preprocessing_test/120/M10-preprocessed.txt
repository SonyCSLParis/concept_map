st michael 's street and george street
in st michael 's street vanbrugh house almost a parody of blenheim
ashlar five bays and three storeys with a slight one bay projection
the top windows are segment headed the first floor windows have squared aprons
but the brobdingnagian spirit of blenheim vanbrugh and swift represent the same generation inspires the centre bay only
two broad giant pilasters each with a bit of entablature on top just one triglyph carry a cornice as deep as though it were a canopy and existing only in that bay
above it the second floor runs through as if nothing had happened
the doorway and the window above it have big triple keystones

castle in paradise street the one high remaining tower of the castle
this is a wall tower really belonging to the curtain wall and the date assigned to it by the rchm royal commission on historical monuments i.e. the late c11 seems too early
the tower is of four stages slightly receding and has a diagonally set staircase in the se angle 
high up on the e wall are remains of large round headed windows
more about the castle at oxford archaeology where evidence suggests mid c11 for the tower i.e. before the norman castle new inn hall street in new inn hall street belonging to st peter 's college the former rectory a fine plain georgian house of five bays and two and a half storeys with lower one bay appendices all very smooth ashlar work

in 1929 sir herbert baker designed the present building
squared rubble in small blocks with ashlar dressings in more or less the same colour
it had no oxford tradition 
rhodes house has a very odd parti of a large cotswold mansion of the late c17 with mullioned and transomed windows balustrade and hipped roof and set between its two front wings a small classical rotunda with portico 
the building is an oddity but it has personality enough to rouse affection in some manor road oxford university 's manor road building by sir norman foster 1999
