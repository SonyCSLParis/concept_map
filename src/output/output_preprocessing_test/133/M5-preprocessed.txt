end video clip)coren anish kapoor welcome to talk asia
kapoor hello coren you are one of the most famous sculptors in the world and many believe that you are responsible for changing the way that people view sculpture
how do you think you 've done this
kapoor
i do n't know that i have but you know we live of course in a world of objects
and we measure ourselves and our whole environment through the objects we interact with
sculpture can question or kind of pose problems in this complex relationship that we have with objects
coren
well some people would say your work is very hard to explain difficult to categorize
how would you describe your work
kapoor
i expect it is hard to categorize in the sense that i 'm looking for philosophical conditions in the way that objects are propositions about a way of thinking or a way of coming to perceive the world
art 's very good at intimacy
good at the thing that says you know come and join in
coren
anish your background is quite fascinating
you were born and raised in india
your father was a hydrographer with the indian navy
your mother an iraqi jew
tell me about your childhood and were you creative as a child
kapoor
yes i grew up in i was born in bombay and brew up in a place called dehra dun which is in the north of india
my childhood was pretty ordinary really
i was n't like all good indian boys i grew up thinking i was going to be a professional
you know an engineer or something like that
something professional in any case
and when sort of in my late teens i decided i was going to be an artist my poor father was horrified
but i sort of knew that it was what i had to do
and i never once i knew it i knew it
i never thought about it again
coren
you moved to london and started art school
and i believe that you said you felt utterly liberated
what did you feel liberated from
kapoor
you know if only it was that straightforward
but anyway i think i felt for the first time i was doing what i really wanted to do
that there was a sense of discovery
a sense of adventure
and i think that 's what 's lived with me over these last 35 years or whatever it is that i 've been so to speak professional as an artist
the sense that making a work is a kind of discovery
you know the studio is more like a laboratory than it is like a place of manufacture
coren
you have lived in london since 1973
when you go back to india does it feel like you 're going home
do you still have that connection
or is the u.k. now very much home kapoor
well i 've lived in the u.k. for you know almost 40 years
and i 'm deeply connected with things indian with my indian roots and so on
but in a way i guess i feel like a foreigner in the u.k. and a foreigner in india
so it 's become a perennial condition
like many of us in a way it 's a kind of modern condition is n't it coren
anish in 1990 you represented britain in the venice biennale
and you say it was a moment that changed your life
how so kapoor
well you know what you do as an artist especially as a young artist but always i think is i suppose you do n't really just make objects
what you 're doing is making a kind of mythology of the object whether it 's a painting or a sculpture whatever it is
or a performance
but you 're making a kind of mythology of yourself as an artist
and there comes a moment when you do n't have to tell the world what you 're doing
they tell you what you 're doing
and i experienced that in a very real way in venice at the biennale when i represented britain as you say
and that was a real revelation
coren
well the following year you won the turner prize
i mean that must have just been mind blowing
kapoor
yes yes
we had to i say we my colleague artists and i had a certain disdain for the turner prize
coren why is that kapoor prizes
we 're not really in the art world or we do n't put ourselves against each other
and of course it is one of those things where you 're up against your colleagues
so anyway coren but looking back
kapoor it 's better to have won it than not let 's say
coren looking back on that win though
and at that particular time in your life
kapoor
yes
yes i mean in i forget when i won the turner prize
in 1990 i think
yes it was then in a way in its first few years
and had a certain there was a certain wow about it i suppose
yes begin video clip)kapoor
so this is the main work in this gallery here is a work called my red homeland
and of course as i 've been saying before color is a real motivator for me
coren
you love red do n't you
kapoor
i love red
i 've worked with red a lot
so what 's happening here to describe it is that the arm is moving this big block that 's simply just moving round very very very slowly
so it 's almost like a kind of geology taking place
coren
anish what inspires you to create something like this laughter)kapoor mad is n't it
at one level this is pretty pretty crazy really
end video clip)(begin video clip)coren do you think your works are confronting
kapoor
oh definitely
and they can be rather frightening
i mean i think that 's very important part of the process
end video clip)(commercial break)(begin video clip)coren how do you feel when you see your works in different countries different landscapes from what you originally kapoor
yes that 's part of what they have to do is they have to stand up to the challenge of being seen in different spaces
so here you see this is in a way a space full of mirror
coren
that is amazing
it plays with your eyes
you ca n't look at it for long or you move
kapoor
right right
and i 'm quite interested in the way it 's almost like a cinema
coren
what made you decide that you wanted to use mirror in y our works
kapoor
i 'm really interested in the way sculpture activates space
and that what these are or works like this so it 's like a painting
it 's like it 's bringing the sky down to the ground
it 's also almost like a hole in space
it 's almost as if the object does n't exist
it 's sort of endless passage through
sky mirror turns the world upside down
end video clip)now i wondered if it was possible to make a mirrored space
by making a concave form mirrored what i found was that this was n't just a mirrored object this was in a way a space full of mirror
it then occurred to me that maybe one could turn it up to the sky and have it reflect the sky since it turns everything upside down
and it became it comes to be almost like a landscape painting
and i was fascinated by that
so i set out to make this great big sky mirror about 10 meters in diameter much bigger than that thing in fact
and we put it at rockefeller center
this was post-9/11 so i was also interested in the way that it would turn bring the sky down to earth in new york and turn that building upside down being another iconic monument if you like of the new york skyline
coren
one of your best known sculptures is marsyas which you did in 2002
it was shown at the tate modern seen by 1.8 million people making it one of the most visited works of sculpture in the world
kapoor
the turbine hall at the tate is you know one of the biggest spaces that there is for indoor sculpture
i decided to use the whole of the space
up until then i suppose artists have used one third of it
that 's big enough
but i 'm mad about these things
i really believe in scale
i think scale is very interesting
coren
because i 'm sure that does scare off a lot of artists using such a grand scale
kapoor
well you know scale has a bad name because the theory is that as a thing gets bigger it gets less meaningful
i 'm not sure that 's really true
so i think big objects can do something poetically wondrous
so you walk into a space and you go without even realizing that that 's your innate body response
i wanted to do something like that for the tate with marsyas
and i wanted to see if it was possible to make an object in that very very big room which was in a way bigger than the room
so you know marsyas is a stretched membrane
and i called it marsyas because it 's like a flayed skin
and of course the myth of marsyas is that he played the flute more beautifully than apollo and for that apollo had him flayed
and so it 's his stretched skin
famous painting by titian
and the idea was that it was somehow bigger you could n't see it all of it from any one place
and it was a question of walking around the three or four points that offered a view and then almost having to put together put the object together in your head
it was bigger than the space which is huge already
that 's what i was after
coren how does something like that come to life
how does that start in your mind
kapoor
well the thing about big objects is or projects like any of those projects is that there 's no rehearsing them
you know you can make a model but a model does n't really tell you very much
not really
there 's no accounting for scale
you know scale and its effect are only they only work at the real scale
the first time i see it is the first time the public sees it or whoever
coren
so tell us about the process
i mean it starts as drawings and then you make small models
kapoor
often there 's drawings yes drawings or models or quite often no drawings no models just make something
whatever at whatever size
coren
just play with whatever materials are in the studio
kapoor
yes yes exactly
i mean i think that is often the process
so i have a few people who work with me in the studio
sculpture is a very long process
i ca n't actually do it all myself
so we work as a team
making things
coren
cloud gate which is truly stunning it 's officially known as the bean in chicago
they had a budget of nine million it blew out to 23 million
and i think every single person who 's seen it absolutely falls in love with it
kapoor
the good citizens of chicago have a civic pride like one rarely sees
i do n't think there are many cities where there is that commitment to the community and to the city as there is in chicago
they asked me to make cloud gate and i simply you know in front of a group of worthy citizens i did a little drawing and said this is what i want to make and this is what i want to do and bless them they ran with it
as you say with a budget that actually was a lot even smaller than $ 8 million as it was at the time
of course i 'm thrilled that it 's there
and it 's interesting when an object like that comes to be part of the sort of myth of the city
it 's as if it 's now one of those things that tourists go and see
coren and embraced by the city as much as it is
kapoor
indeed and so it comes to have a colloquial name you know the bean etcetera etcetera
i think that 's quite an interesting place for an object to go to
coren
and i understand that it 's cleaned every day
kapoor
it 's cleaned every day because there are thousands of people who visit it and touch it every day
begin video clip)coren tell us about cave
kapoor
well it is more or less as described
it 's this big steel object that is rather like a cave
and wound like and interior
it 's also of course architecture
when i was making this i was thinking about you know how to make a really dark object
an object that is completely void
that is sort of literally nothing to look at
coren do you think your works are confronting
kapoor
oh definitely
and they can be rather frightening
i mean i think that 's very important part of the process is that there is a sense that you lose yourself
i think it 's a work that 's very important to me
out of so much other work grew and continues to grow
coren why untitled
why do n't you name something like this
kapoor
sometimes they need titles and sometimes i feel i do n't know what i can say about it
i do n't know what a word would add
a title is almost like another bit of form
it 's like another bit of content
you bring something else to it
and it 's just not necessary i do n't feel it 's necessary anyway
end video clip)(begin video clip)kapoor
i think it 's awkward
i 'm not surprised people love it and hate it
end video clip)(commercial break)(begin video clip)boris johnson mayor london
i think this is a true and beautiful original kapoor work of art
the more you study it the clearer it is that anish kapoor and cecil balmond have come up with i think a truly magnificent piece of public art
a gigantic mutant unclear were how i described it
because people will compare it to a hubble ph bubble ph and a gigantic skeleton a mutant trombone
and all that kind of thing
but even more important i 've absolutely no doubt it will bring people to stratford from across this country and from abroad
and will help to revitalize this part of london
end video clip)coren anish your most recent and controversial sculpture orbit is in london olympic park
some people love it other people hate it
how do you feel about it
kapoor
i think it 's awkward
i 'm not surprised people love it and hate it
like all awkward objects it does have it 's peculiar
it 's important may i say before you judge it go in it
it 's very much about experience again
but towers have always been built symmetrically
they 're you know and cecil balmond and i cecil the engineer and i have worked together on this as a collaboration
and one of the decisions we made pretty early on was to see if we could build an asymmetrical tower a kind of deconstructed tower
i 'm amazed they let us do it
so there it is
but i think because it 's deconstructed because it 's asymmetrical it takes a while to understand what it is as an object
coren why do you describe it as awkward
kapoor
because it is awkward
look at all of its elbows sticking out like this and it 's a very strange form
i hope and of course on the london skyline there are n't you know that many new objects on the skyline on a yearly basis so they 're all hotly debated
so it should be
it should be debated criticized and all of that
that 's part of the deal
and i feel that 's that 's correct
the object needs to go through that process
coren
well how do you deal with criticism
kapoor
depends on who 's giving the criticism
laughter)kapoor do you know look you ca n't do what i do and not be criticized
and it 's part of the deal
it 's ok you know i 've learned to live with it
coren
do you read the reviews
kapoor
sometimes it 's useful too
yes i do read my reviews
i do
sometimes it 's useful
rarely is it useful but sometimes it 's useful
coren
anish it 's estimated that you 've made something like $ 130 million from your art which is a lot of money
does that inspire you
does it motivate you to do what you do
kapoor
you know how can one put it
i think one has to have a relatively straightforward view of money
money has always followed good artists
so i guess it 's part of what there is
i do n't either feel shy about it or feel apologetic about it or any such thing
it 's part of the way the art world works nowadays
it was n't always so
so i guess we have to be very thankful i have to be very thankful
coren i 've heard you say that you do n't necessarily have anything to say that there are no particular messages with your works
so what is it that you want the audience to get out of it
kapoor
yes i have often said that i do n't have anything to say as an artist
because i have a feeling if i did have things to say they 'd just get in the way
and i think part of what i 'm interested in is this sense that in the engagement between the viewer and the object there 's a kind of contemplative stillness that we all recognize that we all know about
that we do n't really need to be told about
and that that in the right way can be quite profound
coren
i now want to move on to chinese artist and dissident ai weiwei
he 's someone who 's obviously caught your attention along with the rest of the world with his outspoken stance against the chinese government
as a result of his detention you cancelled your exhibition to china
how was that received
kapoor
well i made a work in the grand palais in paris called leviathan which i dedicated to ai weiwei
i 've never met him
i mean we are friends colleagues and friends but we 've never met
i felt and continue to feel that what he 's doing is vitally important
i 've also discovered for myself that in supporting him that i have a voice
which in a way i did n't properly recognize until that
so you know i suppose one never does anything without some selfish motive
so that 's kind of interesting too
and then it 's led me to discussions over a period of time with you know the foreign office in the u.k. and so on and so forth
and what i found is that the traditional way in which dialogue is had particularly with the chinese government is to talk tough so to speak in private but be very polite in public
now that 's been going on for the last 30 40 years and longer
i 'm sure it 's the wrong way to do things
coren
anish can you see a time in the future when you stop creating
when you stop being a sculptor
kapoor
i hope not
it 's so much fun more than anything else
you know i 'm as i say and it 's also a kind of it 's of course fundamentally a journey of self discovery
so i ca n't see why i 'd stop
coren
well we hope you do n't
anish kapoor a pleasure to meet you
kapoor
thank you thank you
