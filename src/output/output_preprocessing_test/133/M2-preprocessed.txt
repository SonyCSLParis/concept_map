the chicago cloud gate saints 04/12/2015anish kapoor ’s magic bean | darrin
henry“what do you know for sure i remember oprah winfrey asking michael jackson that question it has stuck in my head ever since
well today this is what i know for sure
ready nothing fascinates people more than looking at images of themselves
yes everyone gets used to the regular images of themselves bathroom mirror selfies etc
but provide a new way for people to view themselves and you ’ll think it was a lost jungle tribe being handed their first mirror
first time in chicago
it ’s our first day out in chicago and we ’re in millennium park awestruck at the cloud gate sculpture designed by british artist anish kapoor
it ’s more commonly referred to as the bean because of its kidney bean shape
and yes both sharon and i are behaving like long lost jungle people
we ’re not even embarrassed because everyone else is doing the same thing
like weirdos we are all grinning at ourselves waving at our reflections taking selfies i even saw one woman reach out to touch it with both hands as though it had magical healing powers
that ’s what it ’s like here at the cloud gate sculpture
you can try to be cool about it but you will fail
standing before this giant bulbous mirror that wraps the entire chicago skyline around you is hypnotic you behave like a child
every cloud has a silver liningi guess variations of our own image have always fascinated us
warped mirrors at fair grounds trick software on computers and of course the big shop windows which certain people ca n’t walk by without sneaking a peek
the novelty never completely wears off
mirror panelled skyscrapers are kind of cool but at the end of the day it ’s just the clouds or nearby buildings they reflect
but the mirrored bean is a whole new kind of intriguing
whether anish kapoor completely predicted the effect or not it ’s kind of genius
standing up close to the cloud gate in absolutely any position and the reflected image is captivating
we really should head off to see more of chicago now
ok just another few minutes let ’s do one last walk round the bean
by the way the man in the mirror ’s answer to oprah oh boy i ’m still learning
i mean life is an education for me
i ca n’t say that i know anything for sure
