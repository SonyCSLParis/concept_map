touristy but great 4 of 5 stars reviewed june 3 2014 of course a restaurant located directly under cloud gate the bean is going to be a tourist hot spot
i was hesitant to go because of this
i was expecting an overcrowded and overpriced experience at park grill but ultimately choose it for dinner with friends who were coming in on the metra to millennium station
it was conveniently located and accepted reservations
we had a reservation through open table and were seated immediately in a great booth near a window
the meal service was a bit slow but the food was great
everyone in my party was happy with their meals we had a few of the salad options a park grill burger truffle fries and calamari
though we ate inside i was admiring the patio
it would be perfect in the spring and early summer
i can image that they get extremely busy so i recommend making a reservation
if you 're staying on michigan avenue this location really ca n't be beat
stop here for dinner after visiting the art institute then go upstairs and see the bean
