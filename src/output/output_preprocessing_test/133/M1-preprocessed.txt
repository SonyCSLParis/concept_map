cloud gate the bean cloud gate is a large public sculpture which was first unveiled at the opening of millennium park in 2004
it soon became one of the city 's most photographed attractions and is now one a famous symbol of chicago
the cloud gate further cemented chicago 's reputation of a city at the forefront of public art and follows in the footsteps of earlier well known public installations such as alexander calder 's flamingo at federal center picasso 's untitled sculpture at the city hall and jean dubuffet 's monument with standing beast at the james r. thompson center
the name even before it was given an official title chicagoans were quick to dub the reflective steel sculpture the bean after its peculiar shape and the name stuck
the official name however is cloud gate as it represents a gate to the city it reflects
designcloud gate was the first public sculpture of indian born and london based artist anish kapoor
his work was selected out of two proposals that were submitted in 1999 for a showpiece sculpture in the new modern millennium park which was scheduled to open in 2000
kapoor designed a stainless steel construction consisting of 168 plates each 1 cm 0.4 inch thick and seamlessly welded together
the structure weighs 100 tons and measures 10 meters high and 20 meters wide 33 x 66 ft
people can walk through the 3.7 meter high central arch where they can look up to the large dent and see numerous distorted reflections of themselves
unveilingwhen the new millennium park was officially inaugurated in 2004 after a four year delay the city was eager to show the sculpture to the public as it had spent the hefty sum of 23 million dollars on what was to become one of the highlights of the park
unfortunately the assembly of the sculpture was well behind schedule and kapoor was reluctant to unveil the unfinished artwork to the public
and not without reason the structure was still unpolished and the seams were visible
as expected many chicagoans were highly critical and dismissed the unfinished bean as a piece of metal
after the inauguration of the park the structure was put back under wraps
not until it was completely finished in may 2006 became its almost magical appeal visible
now seamless and polished the cloud gate reflects and distorts the skyline of michigan avenue the sky and the people nearby who always seem to have the urge to touch the sculpture 's silvery surface
cloud gate instantly became an icon of chicago and an attraction that every visitor to the city wants to see
