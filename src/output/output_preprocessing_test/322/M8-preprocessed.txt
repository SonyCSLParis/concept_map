supreme court cases triggers erosion of tribal court powers december 17 2015 this day in history ex parte crow dog major crimes act of 1885
on this day in history january 17 1883 the u.s. supreme court issued its ruling in ex parte v. crow dog a significant decision siding in favor of tribal court sovereignty
it would eventually trigger congressional action to erode that power
here is the background provided by wikipedia
in 1881 crow dog a member of the brulé band of the lakota sioux shot and killed spotted tail a lakota chief
accounts differ on the details of the killing
regardless of the motives the tribal council dealt with it according to tradition crow dog paid restitution to the dead man ’s family $ 600 eight horses and a blanket
unsatisfied with that result federal authorities assumed authority and prosecuted crow dog for murder in deadwood south dakota
according to wikipedia the deadwood times reported that it was the first time in the history of the country that an indian is held for trial for the murder of another indian crow dog was found guilty and sentenced to hang
the case eventually ended up before the u.s. supreme court
the supreme court held that unless authorized by congress federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council
crow dog was therefore released
congress unhappy with the result passed the major crimes act of 1885
that law places certain major crimes under federal jurisdiction even when committed by native americans against other native americans on reservation land
according to wikipedia the law initially applied to seven major crimes and the number now has grown to 15 including murder manslaughter burglary robbery and felony child abuse and neglect
