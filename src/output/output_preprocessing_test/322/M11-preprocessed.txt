crow dog case 1883)crow dog his rifle and horse the ex parte crow dog case heard by the u.s. supreme court in 1883 illustrates how federal indian law works in several ways
the situation in the case is very interesting and whole books have been written about it
in brief the case involved a brule sioux man named crow dog a traditionalist and a captain of the tribal police force
crow dog shot and killed a man called spotted tail who was viewed as an accommodator and great peace chief by the bureau of indian affairs bia but also known to have a bad temper
spotted tail was the uncle to the famous warrior crazy horse
there are various explanations of why crow dog killed spotted tail but many mention issues over power struggles and a woman named light in the lodge
both men were from the same tribe and the killing took place on reservation land
the tribe handled the case in its traditional way and made crow dog pay restitution of $ 600 8 horses and one blanket which was a significant payment in those days to take care of spotted tail ’s family
the territory of dakota also heard the case the first time in the history of the country that an indian was held on trial for the murder of another indian
the dakota court sentenced crow dog to hang for the murder
spotted tail the case was appealed to the united state supreme court which found that unless congress authorized it the government did not have jurisdiction over a crime committed by one indian on a reservation against another so crow dog was set free
this illustrated the inherent sovereignty that tribes possess the authority of tribes to govern over anything and in any manner unless congress expressly limits or prohibits it
it also illustrates the way federal indian law works in that if congress is silent or unclear about a matter the courts may make a decision that is law until congress says otherwise
congress reacted to this ruling by passing the major crimes act in 1885 placing 15 major crimes under federal jurisdiction if committed by one indian against another on reservation land indian country
this illustrates the plenary power of congress over indian tribes
congress would later pass an act called public law 280 1953 which passed the federal jurisdiction over crimes to certain states to enforce in indian country
alaska was included among those states upon statehood in 1959
