676certiorari to the united states court of appealsfor the ninth circuitsyllabuswhile living on one indian tribe 's reservation petitioner duro an enrolled member of another tribe allegedly shot and killed an indian youth within the reservation 's boundaries
he was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the reservation under the tribal criminal code which is confined to misdemeanors
after the tribal court denied his petition to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal district court
the court granted the writ holding that assertion of jurisdiction by the tribe over a nonmember indian would constitute discrimination based on race in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the indian civil rights act since under oliphant v. suquamish indian tribe 435 u. s. 191 non indians are exempt from tribal courts criminal jurisdiction
the court of appeals reversed
it held that the distinction drawn between a tribe 's members and nonmembers throughout united states v. wheeler 435 u. s. 313 which in upholding tribal criminal jurisdiction over tribe members stated that tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers was indiscriminate and should be given little weight
finding the historical record equivocal the court held that the applicable federal criminal statutes supported the view that the tribes retain jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by indians against other indians without regard to tribal membership
it also rejected duro 's equal protection claim finding that his significant contacts with the prosecuting tribe such as residing with a tribe member on the reservation and working for the tribe 's construction company justified the exercise of the tribe 's jurisdiction
finally it found that the failure to recognize tribal jurisdiction over duro would create a jurisdictional void since the relevant federal criminal statute would not apply to this charge and since the state had made no attempt and might lack the authority to prosecute him
page 495 u. s. 677 held an indian tribe may not assert criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember indian
pp 495 u. s. 684 698
a the rationale of oliphant wheeler and subsequent cases compels the conclusion that indian tribes lack jurisdiction over nonmembers
tribes lack the power to enforce laws against all who come within their borders oliphant supra
they are limited sovereigns necessarily subject to the overriding authority of the united states yet retaining the sovereignty needed to control their own internal relations and preserve their own unique customs and social order wheeler supra
their power to prescribe and enforce rules of conduct for their own members falls outside that part of their sovereignty that they implicitly lost by virtue of their dependent status but the power to prosecute an outsider would be inconsistent with this status and could only come from a delegation by congress
the distinction between members and nonmembers and its relation to self governance is recognized in other areas of indian law
see e.g. moe v. salish kootenai tribes 425 u. s. 463 montana v. united states 450 u. s. 544
although broader retained tribal powers have been recognized in the exercise of civil jurisdiction such jurisdiction typically involves situations arising from property ownership within the reservation or consensual relationships with the tribe or its members and criminal jurisdiction involves a more direct intrusion on personal liberties
since as a nonmember duro can not vote in tribal elections hold tribal office or sit on a tribal jury his relationship with the tribe is the same as the non indian 's in oliphant
pp 495 u. s. 684 688 b a review of the history of the modern tribal courts and the opinions of the solicitor of the department of the interior on the tribal codes at the time of their enactment also indicates that tribal courts embody only the powers of internal self governance
the fact that the federal government treats indians as a single large class with respect to federal programs is not dispositive of a question of tribal power to treat them by the same broad classification
pp 495 u. s. 688 692
c
this case must be decided in light of the fact that all indians are now citizens of the united states
while congress has special powers to legislate with respect to indians indians like all citizens are entitled to protection from unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty
this court 's cases suggest constitutional limits even on the ability of congress to subject citizens to criminal proceedings before a tribunal such as a tribal court that does not provide constitutional protections as a matter of right
in contrast retained jurisdiction over members is accepted by the court 's precedents and justified by the voluntary character page 495 u. s. 678of tribal membership and the concomitant right of participation in a tribal government
duro 's enrollment in one tribe says little about his consent to the exercise of authority over him by another tribe
tribes are not mere fungible groups of homogeneous persons among whom any indian would feel at home but differ in important aspects of language culture and tradition
the rationale of adopting a contacts test to determine which nonmember indians must be subject to tribal jurisdiction would apply to non indian residents as well and is little more than a variation of the argument already rejected for non indians that any person entering the reservation is deemed to have given implied consent to tribal criminal jurisdiction
pp 495 u. s. 692 696 d
this decision does not imply endorsement of a jurisdictional void over minor crime by nonmembers
congress is the proper body to address the problem if in fact the present jurisdictional scheme proves insufficient to meet the practical needs of reservation law enforcement

page 495 u. s. 679 justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court
we address in this case whether an indian tribe may assert criminal jurisdiction over a defendant who is an indian but not a tribal member
we hold that the retained sovereignty of the tribe as a political and social organization to govern its own affairs does not include the authority to impose criminal sanctions against a citizen outside its own membership
ithe events giving rise to this jurisdictional dispute occurred on the salt river indian reservation
the reservation was authorized by statute in 1859 and established by executive order of president hayes in 1879
it occupies some 49,200 acres just east of scottsdale arizona below the mc dowell mountains
the reservation is the home of the salt river pima maricopa indian community a recognized tribe with an enrolled membership
the petitioner in this case albert duro is an enrolled member of another indian tribe the torres martinez band of cahuilla mission indians
petitioner is not eligible for membership in the pima maricopa tribe
as a nonmember he is not entitled to vote in pima maricopa elections to hold tribal office or to serve on tribal juries
salt river pima maricopa indian community code of ordinances 3 1 3 2 5 40 app
55 59 petitioner has lived most of his life in his native state of california outside any indian reservation
between march and june 1984 he resided on the salt river reservation with a pima maricopa woman friend
he worked for the pi copa construction company which is owned by the tribe
on june 15 1984 petitioner allegedly shot and killed a 14 year old boy within the salt river reservation boundaries
the victim was a member of the gila river indian tribe of arizona a separate tribe that occupies a separate reservation
a complaint was filed in united states district court charging petitioner with murder and aiding and abetting page 495 u. s. 680murder in violation of 18 u.s.c. 2 1111 and 1153
footnote 1 federal agents arrested petitioner in california but the federal indictment was later dismissed without prejudice on the motion of the united states attorney
page 495 u. s. 681 petitioner then was placed in the custody of pima maricopa officers and he was taken to stand trial in the pima maricopa indian community court
the tribal court 's powers are regulated by a federal statute which at that time limited tribal criminal penalties to six months imprisonment and a $ 500 fine
25 u.s.c. 1302(7
the tribal criminal code is therefore confined to misdemeanors
footnote 2 petitioner was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the reservation
after the tribal court denied petitioner 's motion to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction he filed a petition page 495 u. s. 682for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of arizona naming the tribal chief judge and police chief as respondents
the district court granted the writ holding that assertion of jurisdiction by the tribe over an indian who was not a member would violate the equal protection guarantees of the indian civil rights act 25 u.s.c. 1302 et seq
under this court 's holding in oliphant v. suquamish indian tribe 435 u. s. 191 1978 tribal courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non indians
the district court reasoned that in light of this limitation to subject a nonmember indian to tribal jurisdiction where non indians are exempt would constitute discrimination based on race
the court held that respondents failed to articulate a valid reason for the difference in treatment under either rational basis or strict scrutiny standards noting that nonmember indians have no greater right to participation in tribal government than non indians and no lesser fear of discrimination in a court system that bars the participation of their peers
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed
821 f.2d 1358 1987
both the panel opinion and the dissent were later revised
851 f.2d 1136 1988
the court of appeals examined our opinion in united states v. wheeler 435 u. s. 313 1978 decided 16 days after oliphant a case involving a member prosecuted by his tribe in which we stated that tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers
 the court of appeals concluded that the distinction drawn between members and nonmembers of a tribe throughout our wheeler opinion was indiscriminate and that the court should give little weight to these casual references
 851 f.2d at 1140 1141
the court also found the historical record equivocal on the question of tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers
the court of appeals then examined the federal criminal statutes applicable to indian country
see 18 u.s.c. 1151 1153
finding that references to indians in those page 495 u. s. 683statutes and the cases construing them applied to all indians without respect to their particular tribal membership the court concluded that if congress had intended to divest tribal courts of criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians they would have done so

the tribes it held retain jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by indians against other indians without regard to tribal membership
 851 f.2d at 1143
the court of appeals rejected petitioner 's equal protection argument under the indian civil rights act
it found no racial classification in subjecting petitioner to tribal jurisdiction that could not be asserted over a non indian
instead it justified tribal jurisdiction over petitioner by his significant contacts with the pima maricopa community such as residing with a member of the tribe on the reservation and his employment with the tribe 's construction company
the need for effective law enforcement on the reservation provided a rational basis for the classification id. at 1145
as a final basis for its result the panel said that failure to recognize tribal jurisdiction over petitioner would create a jurisdictional void
 to treat petitioner as a non indian for jurisdictional purposes would thwart the exercise of federal criminal jurisdiction over the misdemeanor because as the court saw it the relevant federal criminal statute would not apply to this case due to an exception for crimes committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian
 see 18 u.s.c. 1152
this would leave the crime subject only to the state authorities which had made no effort to prosecute petitioner and might lack the power to do so
851 f.2d at 1145 1146
judge sneed dissented arguing that this court 's opinions limit the criminal jurisdiction of an indian tribe to its members and that congress has given the tribe no criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers
he reasoned that the federal criminal statutes need not be construed to create a jurisdictional page 495 u. s. 684void and stressed that recognition of jurisdiction here would place the nonmember indian unlike any other citizen in jeopardy of trial by an alien tribunal
id. at 1146 1151
these views were reiterated by three other ninth circuit judges in a dissent from denial of rehearing en banc
860 f.2d 1463 1988
the dissenters accepted petitioner 's contention that tribal jurisdiction subjected him to an impermissible racial classification and to a tribunal with the potential for bias
between the first and second sets of opinions from the ninth circuit panel the eighth circuit held that tribal courts do not possess inherent criminal jurisdiction over persons not members of the tribe
greywater v. joshua 846 f.2d 486 1988
due to the timing of the opinions both the eighth circuit and the ninth circuit in this case had the benefit of the other 's analysis but rejected it
we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict 490 u.s. 1034 1989 and now reverse
iiour decisions in oliphant and wheeler provide the analytic framework for resolution of this dispute
oliphant established that the inherent sovereignty of the indian tribes does not extend to criminal jurisdiction over non indians who commit crimes on the reservation
wheeler reaffirmed the longstanding recognition of tribal jurisdiction over crimes committed by tribe members
the case before us is at the intersection of these two precedents for here the defendant is an indian but not a member of the tribe that asserts jurisdiction
as in oliphant the tribal officials do not claim jurisdiction under an affirmative congressional authorization or treaty provision and petitioner does not contend that congress has legislated to remove jurisdiction from the tribes
the question we must answer is whether the sovereignty retained by the tribes in their dependent status within our scheme of government includes the power of criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers
page 495 u. s. 685 we think the rationale of our decisions in oliphant and wheeler as well as subsequent cases compels the conclusion that indian tribes lack jurisdiction over persons who are not tribe members
our discussion of tribal sovereignty in wheeler bears most directly on this case
we were consistent in describing retained tribal sovereignty over the defendant in terms of a tribe 's power over its members
indeed our opinion in wheeler stated that the tribes can not try nonmembers in tribal courts
 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 326
literal application of that statement to these facts would bring this case to an end
yet respondents and amici including the united states argue forcefully that this statement in wheeler can not be taken as a statement of the law for the party before the court in wheeler was a member of the tribe
it is true that wheeler presented no occasion for a holding on the present facts
but the double jeopardy question in wheeler demanded an examination of the nature of retained tribal power
we held that jurisdiction over a navajo defendant by a navajo court was part of retained tribal sovereignty not a delegation of authority from the federal government
it followed that a federal prosecution of the same offense after a tribal conviction did not involve two prosecutions by the same sovereign and therefore did not violate the double jeopardy clause
our analysis of tribal power was directed to the tribes status as limited sovereigns necessarily subject to the overriding authority of the united states yet retaining necessary powers of internal self governance
we recognized that the sovereignty that the indian tribes retain is of a unique and limited character
 id. at 435 u. s. 323
a basic attribute of full territorial sovereignty is the power to enforce laws against all who come within the sovereign 's territory whether citizens or aliens
oliphant recognized that the tribes can no longer be described as sovereigns in this sense
rather as our discussion in wheeler reveals the retained sovereignty of the tribes is that needed to control their own internal relations and to preserve their own page 495 u. s. 686unique customs and social order
the power of a tribe to prescribe and enforce rules of conduct for its own members does not fall within that part of sovereignty which the indians implicitly lost by virtue of their dependent status
the areas in which such implicit divestiture of sovereignty has been held to have occurred are those involving the relations between an indian tribe and nonmembers of the tribe
 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 326
as we further described the distinction:"[t]he dependent status of indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations
but the powers of self government including the power to prescribe and enforce internal criminal laws are of a different type
they involve only the relations among members of a tribe
t]hey are not such powers as would necessarily be lost by virtue of a tribe 's dependent status
 ibid
our finding that the tribal prosecution of the defendant in wheeler was by a sovereign other than the united states rested on the premise that the prosecution was a part of the tribe 's internal self governance
had the prosecution been a manifestation of external relations between the tribe and outsiders such power would have been inconsistent with the tribe 's dependent status and could only have come to the tribe by delegation from congress subject to the constraints of the constitution
the distinction between members and nonmembers and its relation to self governance is recognized in other areas of indian law
exemption from state taxation for residents of a reservation for example is determined by tribal membership not by reference to indians as a general class
we have held that states may not impose certain taxes on transactions of tribal members on the reservation because this would interfere with internal governance and self determination
see moe v. salish kootenai tribes 425 u. s. 463 1976 mc clanahan v. arizona state tax page 495 u. s. 687 comm'n 411 u. s. 164 1973
but this rationale does not apply to taxation of nonmembers even where they are indians:"nor would the imposition of washington 's tax on these purchasers contravene the principle of tribal self government for the simple reason that nonmembers are not constituents of the governing tribe
for most practical purposes they stand on the same footing as non indians resident on the reservation
there is no evidence that nonmembers have a say in tribal affairs or significantly share in tribal disbursements
 washington v. confederated tribes of colville indian reservation 447 u. s. 134 1980
similarly in montana v. united states 450 u. s. 544 1981 we held that the crow tribe could regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on land held by the tribe or held in trust for the tribe by the united states
but this power could not extend to nonmembers activities on land they held in fee
again we relied upon the view of tribal sovereignty set forth in oliphant:"though oliphant only determined inherent tribal authority in criminal matters the principles on which it relied support the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe
 450 u.s. at 450 u. s. 565 footnote omitted
it is true that our decisions recognize broader retained tribal powers outside the criminal context
tribal courts for example resolve civil disputes involving nonmembers including non indians see e.g. santa clara pueblo v. martinez 436 u. s. 49 436 u. s. 65 66 1978
williams v. lee 358 u. s. 217 358 u. s. 223 1959 f. cohen handbook of federal indian law 253 1982 ed hereafter cohen the development of principles governing civil jurisdiction in indian country has been markedly different from the development of rules dealing page 495 u. s. 688with criminal jurisdiction
civil authority may also be present in areas such as zoning where the exercise of tribal authority is vital to the maintenance of tribal integrity and self determination
see e.g. brendale v. confederated tribes and bands of yakima indian nation 492 u. s. 408 1989
as distinct from criminal prosecution this civil authority typically involves situations arising from property ownership within the reservation or consensual relationships with the tribe or its members through commercial dealing contracts leases or other arrangements
 montana v. united states supra 450 u.s. at 450 u. s. 565
the exercise of criminal jurisdiction subjects a person not only to the adjudicatory power of the tribunal but also to the prosecuting power of the tribe and involves a far more direct intrusion on personal liberties
the tribes are to be sure a good deal more than private voluntary organizations and are aptly described as unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory
 united states v. mazurie 419 u. s. 544 419 u. s. 557 1975
in the area of criminal enforcement however tribal power does not extend beyond internal relations among members
petitioner is not a member of the pima maricopa tribe and is not now eligible to become one
neither he nor other members of his tribe may vote hold office or serve on a jury under pima maricopa authority
cf oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 194 and n. 4
for purposes of criminal jurisdiction petitioner 's relations with this tribe are the same as the non indian 's in oliphant
we hold that the tribe 's powers over him are subject to the same limitations
iiirespondent and amici argue that a review of history requires the assertion of jurisdiction here
we disagree
the historical record in this case is somewhat less illuminating than in oliphant but tends to support the conclusion we page 495 u. s. 689reach
early evidence concerning tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers is lacking because"[u]ntil the middle of this century few indian tribes maintained any semblance of a formal court system
offenses by one indian against another were usually handled by social and religious pressure and not by formal judicial processes emphasis was on restitution rather than punishment
 oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 197
cases challenging the jurisdiction of modern tribal courts are few perhaps because most parties acquiesce to tribal jurisdiction where it is asserted
see national american indian court judges association indian courts and the future 48 1978
we have no occasion in this case to address the effect of a formal acquiescence to tribal jurisdiction that might be made for example in return for a tribe 's agreement not to exercise its power to exclude an offender from tribal lands see infra at 495 u. s. 696 697
respondents rely for their historical argument upon evidence that definitions of indian in federal statutes and programs apply to all indians without respect to membership in a particular tribe
for example the federal jurisdictional statutes applicable to indian country use the general term indian
 see 18 u.s.c. 1152 1153
in construing such a term in the act of june 30 1834 ch 161 4 stat 733 this court stated that it does not speak to members of a tribe but of the race generally of the family of indians
 united states v. rogers 4 how 567 45 u. s. 573 1846
respondents also emphasize that courts of indian offenses which were established by regulation in 1883 by the department of the interior and continue to operate today on reservations without tribal courts possess jurisdiction over all indian offenders within the relevant reservation
see 25 cfr 11.2(a 1989
this evidence does not stand for the proposition respondents advance
congressional and administrative provisions such as those cited above reflect the government 's treatment of indians as a single large class with respect to federal jurisdiction page 495 u. s. 690and programs
those references are not dispositive of a question of tribal power to treat indians by the same broad classification
in colville supra we noted the fallacy of reliance upon the fact that member and nonmember indians may both be indians under a federal definition as proof of federal intent that inherent tribal power must affect them equally:"[t]he mere fact that nonmembers resident on the reservation come within the definition of indian for purposes of the indian reorganization act of 1934 48 stat
988 25 u.s.c. 479 does not demonstrate a congressional intent to exempt such indians from state taxation
 colville 447 u.s. at 447 u. s. 161 similarly here respondents review of the history of federal provisions does not sustain their claim of tribal power
we did note in wheeler that federal statutes showed congress had recognized and declined to disturb the traditional and undisputed power of the tribes over members
435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 324 325
but for the novel and disputed issue in the case before us the statutes reflect at most the tendency of past indian policy to treat indians as an undifferentiated class
the historical record prior to the creation of modern tribal courts shows little federal attention to the individual tribes powers as between themselves or over one another 's members
scholars who do find treaties or other sources illuminating have only divided in their conclusions
compare comment jurisdiction over nonmember indians on reservations 1980 ariz. st. l.j. 727 740 treaties suggest lack of jurisdiction over nonmembers with note who is an indian 
duro v. reina 's examination of tribal sovereignty and criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians 1988 b.y. u.l.rev 161 170 171 treaties suggest retention of jurisdiction over nonmembers
the brief history of the tribal courts themselves provides somewhat clearer guidance
the tribal courts were established under the auspices of the indian reorganization act page 495 u. s. 691of 1934 ch 576 48 stat 984 codified at 25 u.s.c. 461 479
the 60 years preceding the act had witnessed a calculated policy favoring elimination of tribal institutions sale of tribal lands and assimilation of indians as individuals into the dominant culture
many indian leaders and others fought to preserve tribal integrity however and the 1930 's saw a move toward toleration of indian self determination
see generally cohen 127 153 s. tyler a history of indian policy 70 150 1973 a. debo a history of the indians of the united states 201 300 1970
the indian reorganization act allowed the expression of retained tribal sovereignty by authorizing creation of new tribal governments constitutions and courts
the new tribal courts supplanted the federal courts of indian offenses operated by the bureau of indian affairs
significantly new law and order codes were required to be approved by the secretary of the interior
see 25 u.s.c. 476
the opinions of the solicitor of the department of the interior on the new tribal codes leave unquestioned the authority of the tribe over its members
evidence on criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers is less clear but on balance supports the view that inherent tribal jurisdiction extends to tribe members only
one opinion flatly declares that i]nherent rights of self government may be invoked to justify punishment of members of the tribe but not of nonmembers
 1 op sol 699 nov. 17 1936
but this opinion refers to an earlier opinion that speaks in broad terms of jurisdiction over indians generally
55 i.d. 14 oct. 25 1934 1 op sol 445
another opinion disapproved a tribal ordinance covering all indians on the ground that the tribal constitution embraced only members
the solicitor suggested two alternative remedies amendment of the tribal constitution and delegation of federal authority from the secretary
1 op sol 736 mar. 17 1937
one of these options would reflect a belief that tribes possess page 495 u. s. 692inherent sovereignty over nonmembers while the other would indicate its absence
two later opinions however give a strong indication that the new tribal courts were not understood to possess power over nonmembers
one mentions only adoption of nonmembers into the tribe or receipt of delegated authority as means of acquiring jurisdiction over nonmember indians
1 op
sol 849 aug. 26 1938
a final opinion states more forcefully that the only means by which a tribe could deal with interloping nonmember indians were removal of the offenders from the reservation or acceptance of delegated authority
1 op
sol 872 feb. 17 1939
these opinions provide the most specific historical evidence on the question before us and we think support our conclusion taken together with the general history preceding the creation of modern tribal courts they indicate that the tribal courts embody only the powers of internal self governance we have described
we are not persuaded that external criminal jurisdiction is an accepted part of the courts function
ivwhatever might be said of the historical record we must view it in light of petitioner 's status as a citizen of the united states
many indians became citizens during the era of allotment and tribal termination around the turn of the century and all were made citizens in 1924
see cohen 142 143 tracing history of indian citizenship
that indians are citizens does not alter the federal government 's broad authority to legislate with respect to enrolled indians as a class whether to impose burdens or benefits
see united states v. antelope 430 u. s. 641 1977
morton v. mancari 417 u. s. 535 1974
in the absence of such legislation however indians like other citizens are embraced within our nation 's great solicitude that its citizens be protected
from unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty
 oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 210
page 495 u. s. 693 criminal trial and punishment is so serious an intrusion on personal liberty that its exercise over non indian citizens was a power necessarily surrendered by the tribes in their submission to the overriding sovereignty of the united states
ibid
we hesitate to adopt a view of tribal sovereignty that would single out another group of citizens nonmember indians for trial by political bodies that do not include them
as full citizens indians share in the territorial and political sovereignty of the united states
the retained sovereignty of the tribe is but a recognition of certain additional authority the tribes maintain over indians who consent to be tribal members
indians like all other citizens share allegiance to the overriding sovereign the united states
a tribe 's additional authority comes from the consent of its members and so in the criminal sphere membership marks the bounds of tribal authority
the special nature of the tribunals at issue makes a focus on consent and the protections of citizenship most appropriate
while modern tribal courts include many familiar features of the judicial process they are influenced by the unique customs languages and usages of the tribes they serve
tribal courts are often subordinate to the political branches of tribal governments and their legal methods may depend on unspoken practices and norms
 cohen 334 335
it is significant that the bill of rights does not apply to indian tribal governments
talton v. mayes 163 u. s. 376 1896
the indian civil rights act provides some statutory guarantees of fair procedure but these guarantees are not equivalent to their constitutional counterparts
there is for example
no right under the act to appointed counsel for those unable to afford a lawyer see 25 u.s.c. 1302(6
our cases suggest constitutional limitations even on the ability of congress to subject american citizens to criminal proceedings before a tribunal that does not provide constitutional protections as a matter of right
cf
reid v. covert page 495 u. s. 694354 u. s. 1 1957
we have approved delegation to an indian tribe of the authority to promulgate rules that may be enforced by criminal sanction in federal court united states v. mazurie 419 u. s. 544 1975 but no delegation of authority to a tribe has to date included the power to punish nonmembers in tribal court
we decline to produce such a result through recognition of inherent tribal authority
tribal authority over members who are also citizens is not subject to these objections
retained criminal jurisdiction over members is accepted by our precedents and justified by the voluntary character of tribal membership and the concomitant right of participation in a tribal government the authority of which rests on consent
this principle finds support in our cases decided under provisions that predate the present federal jurisdictional statutes
we held in united states v. rogers 4 how 567 1846 that a non indian could not through his adoption into the cherokee tribe bring himself within the federal definition of indian for purposes of an exemption to a federal jurisdictional provision
but we recognized that a non indian could by adoption become entitled to certain privileges in the tribe and make himself amenable to their laws and usages
 id. at 4 how 45 u. s. 573 see nofire v. united states 164 u. s. 657 1897
with respect to such internal laws and usages the tribes are left with broad freedom not enjoyed by any other governmental authority in this country
see e.g. santa clara pueblo v. martinez 436 u. s. 49 436 u. s. 56 and n. 7 1978 noting that bill of rights is inapplicable to tribes and holding that the indian civil rights act of 1968 25 u.s.c. 1301 1303 does not give rise to a federal cause of action against the tribe for violations of its provisions
this is all the more reason to reject an extension of tribal authority over those who have not given the consent of the governed that provides a fundamental basis for power within our constitutional system
see merrion v. jicarilla apache tribe 455 u. s. 130 455 u. s. 172 173 1982 stevens j. dissenting
page 495 u. s. 695 the united states suggests that pima maricopa tribal jurisdiction is appropriate because petitioner 's enrollment in the torres martinez band of cahuilla mission indians"is a sufficient indication of his self identification as an indian with traditional indian cultural values to make it reasonable to subject him to the tribal court system which
implements traditional indian values and customs
 brief for united states as amicus curiae 27
but the tribes are not mere fungible groups of homogeneous persons among whom any indian would feel at home
on the contrary wide variations in customs art language and physical characteristics separate the tribes and their history has been marked by both intertribal alliances and animosities

petitioner 's general status as an indian says little about his consent to the exercise of authority over him by a particular tribe
the court of appeals sought to address some of these concerns by adopting a contacts test to determine which nonmember indians might be subject to tribal jurisdiction
but the rationale of the test would apply to non indians on the reservation as readily as to indian nonmembers
many non indians reside on reservations and have close ties to tribes through marriage or long employment
indeed the population of non indians on reservations generally is greater than the population of all indians both members and nonmembers and non indians make up some 35 of the salt river reservation population
see u.s. dept of commerce bureau of census supplementary report american indian areas and alaska native villages 1980 census of population 16 19
the contacts approach is little more than a variation of the argument that any person who enters an indian community should be deemed to have given implied consent to tribal criminal jurisdiction over him
we have rejected this approach for non indians
it is a logical consequence of that page 495 u. s. 696decision that nonmembers who share relevant jurisdictional characteristics of non indians should share the same jurisdictional status
vrespondents and amici contend that without tribal jurisdiction over minor offenses committed by nonmember indians no authority will have jurisdiction over such offenders
they assert that unless we affirm jurisdiction in this case the tribes will lack important power to preserve order on the reservation and nonmember indians will be able to violate the law with impunity
footnote 3 although the jurisdiction at stake here is over relatively minor crime we recognize that protection of the community from disturbances of the peace and other misdemeanors is a most serious matter
but this same interest in tribal law enforcement is applicable to non indian reservation residents whose numbers are often greater
it was argued in oliphant that the absence of tribal jurisdiction over non indians would leave a practical if not legal void in reservation law enforcement
see brief for respondent in oliphant v. suquamish indian tribe o.t.1977 no 76 5729
the argument that only tribal jurisdiction could meet the need for effective law enforcement did not provide a basis for finding jurisdiction in oliphant neither is it sufficient here
for felonies such as the murder alleged in this case at the outset federal jurisdiction is in place under the major crimes act 18 u.s.c. 1153
the tribes also possess their traditional and undisputed power to exclude persons whom they deem to be undesirable from tribal lands
see brendale v. confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation 492 u.s. at 492 u. s. 422 new mexico v. mescalero page 495 u. s. 697 apache tribe 462 u. s. 324 462 u. s. 333 1983
worcester v. georgia 6 pet 515 561 1832 cohen 252
tribal law enforcement authorities have the power to restrain those who disturb public order on the reservation and if necessary to eject them
where jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside the tribe tribal officers may exercise their power to detain the offender and transport him to the proper authorities
respondents major objection to this last point is that in the circumstances presented here there may not be any lawful authority to punish the nonmember indian
state authorities may lack the power resources or inclination to deal with reservation crime
arizona for example specifically disclaims jurisdiction over indian country crimes
ariz. const art 20 4 and federal authority over minor crime otherwise provided by the indian country crimes act 18 u.s.c. 1152 may be lacking altogether in the case of crime committed by a nonmember indian against another indian since 1152 states that general federal jurisdiction over indian country crime shall not extend to offenses committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian
 our decision today does not imply endorsement of the theory of a jurisdictional void presented by respondents and the court below
states may with the consent of the tribes assist in maintaining order on the reservation by punishing minor crime
congress has provided a mechanism by which the states now without jurisdiction in indian country may assume criminal jurisdiction through public law 280 see n 1 supra
our decision here also does not address the ability of neighboring tribal governments that share law enforcement concerns to enter into reciprocal agreements giving each jurisdiction over the other 's members
as to federal jurisdiction under 1152 both academic commentators and the dissenting judge below have suggested that the statute could be construed to cover the conduct here
see 851 f.2d at 1150 1151page 495 u. s. 698(sneed j. dissenting 1980 ariz. st. l.j. at 743 745
others have disagreed
that statute is not before us and we express no views on the question
if the present jurisdictional scheme proves insufficient to meet the practical needs of reservation law enforcement then the proper body to address the problem is congress which has the ultimate authority over indian affairs
we can not however accept these arguments of policy as a basis for finding tribal jurisdiction that is inconsistent with precedent history and the equal treatment of native american citizens
the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed
footnote 1]jurisdiction in indian country which is defined in 18 u.s.c. 1151 see united states v. john 437 u. s. 634 437 u. s. 648 649 1978 is governed by a complex patchwork of federal state and tribal law
for enumerated major felonies such as murder rape assault and robbery federal jurisdiction over crime committed by an indian is provided by 18 u.s.c. 1153 commonly known as the major crimes act which as amended in 1986 states:"(a any indian who commits against the person or property of another indian or other person any of the following offenses namely murder manslaughter kidnaping maiming a felony under chapter 109a incest assault with intent to commit murder assault with a dangerous weapon assault resulting in serious bodily injury arson burglary robbery and a felony under section 661 of this title within the indian country shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states
 b any offense referred to in subsection a of this section that is not defined and punished by federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the state in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense
 it remains an open question whether jurisdiction under 1153 over crimes committed by indian tribe members is exclusive of tribal jurisdiction
see united states v. wheeler 435 u. s. 313 435 u. s. 325 n. 22 1978
another federal statute the indian country crimes act 18 u.s.c. 1152 applies the general laws of the united states to crimes committed in indian country:"except as otherwise expressly provided by law the general laws of the united states as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the united states except the district of columbia shall extend to the indian country
 the general law of the united states may assimilate state law in the absence of an applicable federal statute
18 u.s.c. 13 section 1152 also contains the following exemptions:"this section shall not extend to offenses committed by one indian against the person or property of another indian nor to any indian committing any offense in the indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe or to any case where by treaty stipulations the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the indian tribes respectively
 for indian country crimes involving only non lndians longstanding precedents of this court hold that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction despite the terms of 1152
see new york ex rel
ray v. martin 326 u. s. 498 1946 united states v. mc bratney 104 u. s. 621 1882
certain states may also assume jurisdiction over indian country crime with the consent of the affected tribe pursuant to public law 280 act of aug. 15 1953 ch 505 67 stat 588 codified as amended at 18 u.s.c. 1162 25 u.s.c. 1321 1326 28 u.s.c. 1360
the final source of criminal jurisdiction in indian country is the retained sovereignty of the tribes themselves
it is undisputed that the tribes retain jurisdiction over their members subject to the question of exclusive jurisdiction under 1153 mentioned above
see united states v. wheeler supra
the extent of tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers is at issue here

under a 1986 amendment to the act the limit on tribal court criminal punishment is now set at one year imprisonment and a $ 5000 fine
the act also provides protections similar though not identical to those contained in the bill of rights which does not apply to the tribes see talton v. mayes 163 u. s. 376 1896

footnote 3]we note that a jurisdictional void would remain under the approach of the court below
affording tribal court jurisdiction over indians with a sufficient level of contacts to the reservation would presumably leave indians visiting or passing through the reservation outside the tribe 's jurisdiction
justice brennan with whom justice marshall joins dissenting
the court today holds that an indian tribal court has no power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a defendant who is an indian but not a tribal member
the court concedes that indian tribes never expressly relinquished such power
instead the court maintains that tribes implicitly surrendered the power to enforce their criminal laws against nonmember indians when the tribes became dependent on the federal government
because i do not share such a parsimonious view of the sovereignty retained by indian tribes i respectfully dissent
ithe powers of indian tribes are inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished
 united states v. wheeler 435 u. s. 313 435 u. s. 322 1978 quoting f. cohen handbook of federal indian law 122 1945 emphasis in original
when the tribes were incorporated into the territory of the united states and accepted the protection of the federal government they necessarily lost some of the sovereign powers they had previously exercised
in wheeler we explained page 495 u. s. 699"[t]he sovereignty that the indian tribes retain is of a unique and limited character
it exists only at the sufferance of congress and is subject to complete defeasance
but until congress acts the tribes retain their existing sovereign powers
in sum indian tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status
 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 323 citations omitted
by becoming domestic dependent nations indian tribes were divested of any power to determine their external relations
see i d. at 435 u. s. 326
tribes therefore have no inherent power to enter into direct diplomatic or commercial relations with foreign nations

a tribe is implicitly divested of powers to have external relations because they are necessarily inconsistent with the overriding interest of the greater sovereign
see brendale v. confederated tribes and bands of yakima indian nation 492 u. s. 408 492 u. s. 451 1989 blackmun j. dissenting
by contrast we have recognized that tribes did not"surrender
their independence the right to self government by associating with a stronger power and taking its protection
 worcester supra at 6 pet 560 561
tribes have retained the powers of self government including the power to prescribe and enforce internal criminal laws
 wheeler supra 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 326
i agree with the court that"[a basic attribute of full territorial sovereignty is the power to enforce laws against all who come within the sovereign 's territory whether citizens or aliens
 ante at 495 u. s. 685 i disagree with the court that oliphant v. suquamish indian tribe 435 u. s. 191 435 u. s. 212 1978 recognized that the tribes can no longer be described page 495 u. s. 700as sovereigns in this sense
 ante at 495 u. s. 685
in oliphant the court held that tribes did not have the power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non indians because such power was inconsistent with the overriding national interest
but it does not follow that because tribes lost their power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non indians they also lost their power to enforce criminal laws against indians who are not members of their tribe ain oliphant the court did not point to any statutes or treaties expressly withdrawing tribal power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers but instead held that the tribe was implicitly divested of such power
the court today appears to read oliphant as holding that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over anyone but members of the tribe is inconsistent with the tribes dependent status
see ante at 495 u. s. 686
footnote 2/1 but oliphant established no such broad principle
page 495 u. s. 701 rather the holding in oliphant supra was based on an analysis of congress actions with respect to non indians
the court first considered the"commonly shared presumption of congress the executive branch and lower federal courts that tribal courts do not have the power to try non indians
 id. at 435 u. s. 206
then the court declared that the power to punish non indians was inconsistent with the tribes dependent status for such power conflicted with the overriding interest of the federal government in protecting its citizens against unwarranted intrusions on their liberty
see i d. at 435 u. s. 208 212
by submitting to the overriding sovereignty of the united states indian tribes therefore necessarily gave up their power to try non indian citizens of the page 495 u. s. 702 united states except in a manner acceptable to congress
 id. at 435 u. s. 210 emphasis added
a consideration of the relevant congressional enactments reveals that the opposite conclusion is appropriate with respect to nonmember indians
in 1790 when congress first addressed the rules governing crimes in indian country it made crimes committed by citizens or inhabitants of the united states against indians punishable according to the laws of the state in which the offense occurred and directed the state courts to take jurisdiction of such offenses
see the trade and intercourse act of 1790 1 stat 138 ch 33
in 1817 congress withdrew that jurisdiction from the states and provided for federal jurisdiction and the application of federal enclaves law over crimes committed within indian country
congress made an explicit exception for crimes committed by an indian against another indian however:"nothing in this act shall be so construed
to extend to any offence committed by one indian against another within any indian boundary
 3 stat 383 ch 92 codified as amended at 18 u.s.c. 1152
in 1854 congress again amended the statute to proscribe prosecution in federal court of an indian who had already been tried in tribal court
10 stat 270 ch 30
finally in 1885 congress made a limited but significant departure from its consistent practice of leaving to indian tribes the task of punishing crimes committed by indians against indians
in response to this court 's decision in ex parte crow dog 109 u. s. 556 109 u. s. 571 1883 which held that there was no federal jurisdiction over an indian who murdered another member of his tribe congress passed the major crimes act 23 stat 385 ch 341 codified as amended at 18 u.s.c. 1153 under which certain enumerated crimes including murder manslaughter and arson fall within federal jurisdiction when involving two indians
in oliphant the court relied on this statutory background to conclude that the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over non indianspage 495 u. s. 703was inconsistent with the tribes dependent status for from the early days congress had provided for federal jurisdiction over crimes involving non indians
thus from these affirmative enactments it could be inferred that the tribes were tacitly divested of jurisdiction over non indians
see oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 199 206
but applying the same reasoning the opposite result obtains with respect to tribal jurisdiction over nonmember indians
from the very start congress has consistently exempted indian against indian crimes from the reach of federal or state power although the exemption in the 1790 statute was implicit it was made explicit in the 1817 act
moreover the provision in the 1854 act exempting from federal jurisdiction any indian who had been previously punished by a tribal court amounts to an express acknowledgement by congress of tribal jurisdiction over indians who commit crimes in indian country
the appropriate inference to be drawn from this series of statutes excluding indian against indian crimes from federal jurisdiction is that tribes retained power over those crimes involving only indians
see wheeler 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 324 326
the court acknowledges that these enactments support the inference that tribes retained power over members but concludes that no such inference can be drawn about tribal power over nonmembers
the court finds irrelevant the fact that we have long held that the term indian in these statutes does not differentiate between members and nonmembers of a tribe
see united states v. kagama 118 u. s. 375 118 u. s. 383 1886
see also united states v. rogers
4 how 567 45 u. s. 573 1846 the exception does not speak of members of a tribe but of the race generally of the family of indians
rather the court concludes that the federal definition of indian is relevant only to federal jurisdiction and is not dispositive of a question of tribal power
 ante at 495 u. s. 690
but this conclusion is at odds with the analysis in oliphant in which the congressional enactments served as evidence of a commonly shared presumption that tribes had page 495 u. s. 704ceded their power over non indians
similarly these enactments reflect the congressional presumption that tribes had power over all disputes between indians regardless of tribal membership
footnote 2/2]by refusing to draw this inference from repeated congressional actions the court today creates a jurisdictional void in which neither federal nor tribal jurisdiction exists over nonmember indians who commit minor crimes against another page 495 u. s. 705 indian
footnote 2/3
the court 's conclusion that such a void does not counsel in favor of finding tribal jurisdiction see ante at 495 u. s. 696 misses the point
the existence of a jurisdictional gap is not an independent justification for finding tribal jurisdiction but rather is relevant to determining congressional intent
the unlikelihood that congress intended to create a jurisdictional void in which no sovereign has the power to prosecute an entire class of crimes should inform our understanding of the assumptions about tribal power upon which congress legislated
see oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 206 indian law draws principally upon the treaties drawn and executed by the executive branch and legislation passed by congress
these instruments which beyond their actual text form the backdrop for the intricate web of judicially made indian law can not be interpreted in isolation but must be read in light of the common notions of the day and the assumptions page 495 u. s. 706of those who drafted them citations omitted
rogers supra at 4 how 45 u. s. 573 it can hardly be supposed that congress intended to treat whites adopted by indians as fitting within the indian indian exception
since the scheme created by congress did not differentiate between member and nonmember indians it is logical to conclude that congress did not assume that the power retained by tribes was limited to member indians
bthe court also concludes that because indians are now citizens of the united states the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember of the tribe is inconsistent with the tribe 's dependent status
stated differently the court concludes that regardless of whether tribes were assumed to retain power over nonmembers as a historical matter the tribes were implicitly divested of this power in 1924 when indians became full citizens
see ante at 495 u. s. 692 whatever might be said of the historical record we must view it in light of petitioner 's status as a citizen of the united states
the court reasons that since we held in oliphant that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over non indians conflicted with the federal government 's great solicitude that its citizens be protected
from unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty ante at 495 u. s. 692 quoting oliphant supra 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 210 the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians is also inconsistent with this overriding national interest
there are several problems with this argument
first in oliphant the court held merely that,"[b]y submitting to the overriding sovereignty of the united states indian tribes therefore necessarily give up their power to try non indian citizens of the united states except in a manner acceptable to congress
 oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 210 emphasis added
the touchstone in determining the extent to which citizens can be page 495 u. s. 707subject to the jurisdiction of indian tribes therefore is whether such jurisdiction is acceptable to congress
cf
washington v. confederated tribes of colville indian reservation 447 u. s. 134 447 u. s. 154 1980 i]t must be remembered that tribal sovereignty is dependent on and subordinate to only the federal government not the states
in oliphant federal statutes made clear that the prosecution of non indians in tribal courts is not acceptable to congress
by contrast the same statutes reflect the view that the prosecution of all indians in tribal courts is acceptable to congress
moreover this argument proves too much
if tribes were implicitly divested of their power to enforce criminal laws over nonmember indians once those indians became citizens the tribes were also implicitly divested of their power to enforce criminal laws over their own members who are now citizens as well
the court contends however that tribal members are subject to tribal jurisdiction because of the voluntary character of tribal membership and the concomitant right of participation in a tribal government
 ante at 495 u. s. 694
but we have not required consent to tribal jurisdiction or participation in tribal government as a prerequisite to the exercise of civil jurisdiction by a tribe see williams v. lee 358 u. s. 217 358 u. s. 223 1959 and the court does not explain why such a prerequisite is uniquely salient in the criminal context
nor have we ever held that participation in the political process is a prerequisite to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by a sovereign
if such were the case a state could not prosecute nonresidents and this country could not prosecute aliens who violate our laws
see e.g. united states v. verdugo urquidez 494 u. s. 259 1990 i d. at 494 u. s. 279 281 brennan j. dissenting
the commission of a crime on the reservation is all the consent that is necessary to allow the tribe to exercise criminal jurisdiction over the nonmember indian
finally the court 's consent theory is inconsistent with the underlying premise of indian law namely that congress page 495 u. s. 708has plenary control over indian affairs
congress presumably could pass a statute affirmatively granting indian tribes the right to prosecute anyone who committed a crime on the reservation indian or non indian unconstrained by the fact that neither of these groups participate in tribal government
footnote 2/4 it is therefore unclear why the exercise of power retained by the tribes power not divested by congress is subject to such a constraint
more understandable is the court 's concern that nonmembers may suffer discrimination in tribal courts because such courts are influenced by the unique customs languages and usages of the tribes they serve
 ante at 495 u. s. 693
but congress addressed this problem when it passed the icra 25 u.s.c. 1301 et seq which extended most of the bill of rights to any person tried by a tribal court
footnote 2/5 see santa page 495 u. s. 709 clara pueblo v. martinez 436 u. s. 49 436 u. s. 63 1978
in addition the icra provides the remedy of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of any detention order by a tribe
25 u.s.c. 1303
the equal protection provision 25 u.s.c. 1302(8 requires that nonmembers not be subject to discriminatory treatment in the tribal courts
footnote 2/6
in addition the due process clause ibid ensures that each individual is tried in a fundamentally fair proceeding
iithis country has pursued contradictory policies with respect to the indians
since the passage of the indian reorganization act of 1934 48 stat 984 ch 576 1 codified at 25 u.s.c. 461 however congress has followed a policy of promoting the independence and self government of the various page 495 u. s. 710tribes
the court 's decision today not only ignores the assumptions on which congress originally legislated with respect to the jurisdiction over indian crimes but also stands in direct conflict with current congressional policy
i respectfully dissent
footnote 2/1]the court also contends that a l]iteral application of wheeler v. united states 435 u. s. 313 1978 would bring this case to an end for wheeler states that tribes can not try nonmembers in tribal courts
 ante at 495 u. s. 685 quoting wheeler supra at 435 u. s. 326
in wheeler the court held that the double jeopardy clause was not violated by successive prosecution of a tribal member in a tribal court and then in a federal court because the prosecutions were conducted by different sovereigns
in answering the double jeopardy question the court was required to consider the source of tribal power to punish its own members and the court unequivocally stated that the power to punish members was part of the tribe 's retained sovereignty
435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 326
the statement quoted above however amounts to nothing more than an inaccurate description of the holding in oliphant ibid
citing oliphant v. suquamish indian tribe 435 u. s. 191 1978
moreover given that the defendant in wheeler was a member of the tribe that tried him the discussion of tribal power over nonmembers also quoted by the court today ante at 495 u. s. 686 was dictum
in transmuting this dictum into law the court relies on language from washington v. confederated tribes of colville indian reservation 447 u. s. 134 447 u. s. 161 1980 stating that nonmembers stand on the same footing as non indians resident on the reservation
 ante at 495 u. s. 687 quoting colville supra at 447 u. s. 161
but this reliance is misplaced because the language is found in the court 's discussion of the state 's power over nonmember indians rather than a discussion of the tribe 's power
we have not allowed states to regulate activity on a reservation that interferes with principles of tribal self government
see colville supra at 447 u. s. 161
thus in colville we held that the state could tax nonmembers who purchased cigarettes on a reservation such taxation would not interfere with tribal self government because nonmembers are not constituents of the tribe
see ibid
yet at the same time we held that the tribe could also tax the nonmember purchasers because the power to tax was not implicitly divested as inconsistent with the overriding interests of the federal government
see i d. at 447 u. s. 153
similarly the court 's citation to montana v. united states 450 u. s. 544 1981 for the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe ante at 495 u. s. 687 quoting montana supra at 450 u. s. 565 is also inapposite
in montana the court concluded that the tribe could regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on lands held by the tribe but not on lands within the reservation no longer held by the tribe
see 450 u.s. at 450 u. s. 564
the court recognized however that tribes have as a matter of inherent sovereignty power over nonmembers when they engage in consensual relationships with tribal members and when their conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity the economic stability or the health or welfare of the tribe
 id. at 450 u. s. 566 citations omitted
the court today provides no explanation for why the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember who commits a crime on property held by the tribe involves different concerns see ante at 495 u. s. 688 such that tribes were implicitly divested of that power
footnote 2/2]the court concedes that the statutes reflect a tendency of past indian policy to treat indians as an undifferentiated class
 ante at 495 u. s. 690
nevertheless the court rejects the logical implications of such a policy reasoning that"[t]he historical record prior to the creation of modern tribal courts shows little federal attention to the individual tribes power as between themselves or over one another 's members
 ibid
to the contrary the historical record reveals that congress and the executive had indeed considered the question of intertribal crime
in 1834 congress proposed the western territories bill that would have relocated all indians to the western part of the united states
one provision would have created a general council to regulate commerce among the various tribes preserve peace and punish intertribal crimes
see h.r.rep
no 474 23d cong
1st sess 36 1834
although the bill never passed it clearly shows that congress assumed that the indians would police intertribal disputes
see oliphant 435 u.s. at 435 u. s. 202 relying on different provision of bill
in addition it is clear that the executive branch considered the question of intertribal disputes
in 1883 the solicitor of the department of the interior issued an opinion adopted by the attorney general dealing with the question of federal jurisdiction over an indian accused of murdering a member of another tribe
presaging this court 's holding in ex parte crow dog 109 u. s. 556 1883 by a few months the attorney general concluded that there was no federal jurisdiction over the crime because it fell within the indian against indian exception
17 op
atty
gen. 566 1883
the opinion concluded,"[i]f no demand for foster 's surrender shall be made by one or other of the tribes concerned founded fairly upon a violation of some law of one or other of them having jurisdiction of the offense in question
it seems that nothing remains except to discharge him
 id. at 570
given the proximity of this incident to the crow dog incident it is implausible to conclude that congress did not consider the situation of intertribal crimes when passing the major crimes act
footnote 2/3]because of the indian against lndian exception in 18 u.s.c. 1152 federal courts have no jurisdiction over such crimes
in addition it has long been accepted that states do not have power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over crimes involving indians on the reservation
see worcester v. georgia 6 pet 515 31 u. s. 561 1832
in 1953 however congress enacted pub l. 280 codified as amended at 28 u.s.c. 1360 which allows named states to assume jurisdiction over all crimes within indian country
in section 401(a of the indian civil rights act of 1968 82 stat 79 codified at 25 u.s.c. 1321(a congress modified pub l. 280 to require the affected tribe to consent to a state 's assumption of jurisdiction
arizona has not accepted jurisdiction over crimes occurring on indian reservations
thus under the court 's holding today the tribe federal government and the state each lack jurisdiction to prosecute the crime involved in this case
the court erroneously equates the jurisdictional void that resulted from the holding in oliphant with the void created by the opinion today
since federal courts have jurisdiction over crimes involving non lndians any void resulting from the holding in oliphant would have been caused by the discretionary decision of the federal government not to exercise its already established jurisdiction
such a practical void ante at 495 u. s. 696 is a far cry from the legal void ibid created today in which no sovereign has the power to prosecute an entire class of crimes
footnote 2/4]the court 's suggestion that there might be some independent constitutional limitation on the ability of congress to subject its citizens to prosecution by tribal courts that do not provide a criminal defendant constitutional rights see ante at 495 u. s. 693 694 is unpersuasive given that congress has through the indian civil rights act of 1968 icra 25 u.s.c. 1301 et seq extended to those tried by a tribal court most of the protections of the bill of rights see n. 5 infra most importantly the right to due process

moreover the court 's argument proves too much for it does not account for why members who are also citizens would be subject to tribal jurisdiction participation in tribal government can not in and of itself constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights
footnote 2/5]the icra provides in relevant part that a tribe shall not:"(2 violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable search and seizure
3 subject any person for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy;""(4
compel any person in any criminal case to be a witness against himself 6 deny to any person in a criminal proceeding the right to a speedy and public trial to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and at his own expense to have the assistance of counsel for his defense;""(7 require excessive bail impose excessive fines inflict cruel and unusual punishments

8) deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law;""(9 pass any bill of attainder or ex post facto law or""(10 deny to any person accused of an offense punishable by imprisonment the right upon request to a trial by jury of not less than six persons
 25 u.s.c. 1302
footnote 2/6]petitioner argues that the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonmember violates the equal protection provision of the icra 25 u.s.c. 1302(8 because the tribe does not exercise jurisdiction over non indians
this argument is without merit
the statutory equal protection provision requires the tribe to refrain from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws
 ibid
emphasis added
thus petitioner 's argument simply begs the question of who is within the tribe 's jurisdiction
if nonmember indians are subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the tribe the exercise of jurisdiction in this case does not violate the equal protection provision of the icra
petitioner would state a valid equal protection claim however if he could show that in the exercise of its jurisdiction the tribe treated him differently than others who are also subject to its jurisdiction
