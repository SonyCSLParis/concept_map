old pine church is among the earliest extant log churches in hampshire county along with capon chapel and mount bethel church
the church was constructed in 1838 to serve as a nondenominational union church
as many of the mill creek valley 's earliest settlers were of german descent old pine church may also have been built as a meeting place for schwarzenau brethren adherents known as dunkers or dunkards
the church is believed to have been utilized by german methodist settlers
by 1870 old pine church was primarily used exclusively by the brethren denomination and in 1878 the church 's congregation split into white pine church of the brethren and old pine church congregations
both congregations continued to use old pine church until 1907
the church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship
in 1968 residents of the purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to conduct a restoration of old pine church
the church and its adjoining cemetery were added to the national register of historic places on december 12 2012 due to its significant settlement era rural religious architecture in the potomac highlands
old pine church is a large one story front gable log building sheathed in brown painted wooden german siding
the original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church with some bark remaining on the logs
the church 's interior ceiling measures approximately 15 feet 4.6 m in height and is clad in pressed metal panels
several of its pews date from 1857
in the church 's adjoining cemetery the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834 and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759
according to architectural historian sandra scaffidi old pine church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes
 location[edit]old pine church and its cemetery are located along the steeply sloped old pine church road west virginia secondary route 220/15 approximately 1.66 miles 2.67 km south of the unincorporated community of purgitsville
2][3][4 the church and cemetery are situated on 2.3 acres 0.93 ha atop a bluff to the west of u.s. route 220 at an elevation of 1,129 feet 344 m
5][6 the property is surrounded by old growth forests
7]old pine church is located in a rural area of southwestern hampshire county within the mill creek valley
3][7 patterson creek mountain a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge rises to the west of mill creek valley and the forested western rolling foothills of the anticlinal mill creek mountain rise to the valley 's east
3 the trough on the south branch potomac river is located across mill creek mountain approximately 3 miles 4.8 km to the east of old pine church
3]history[edit]background[edit]the land upon which old pine church is located was originally part of the northern neck proprietary a land grant that charles ii of england awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 and renewed by an official patent in 1688
8][9][10 one of these seven supporters thomas colepeper 2nd baron colepeper acquired the entire area in 1681 his grandson thomas fairfax 6th lord fairfax of cameron inherited it in 1719
8][11][12]the church is located in the mill creek valley
as tensions with native americans were beginning to ease lord fairfax sought to entice white settlers to the sparsely settled lands of his northern neck proprietary
13 the mill creek valley was one of the first parts of present day hampshire county to be settled by whites beginning in the mid-18th century
14 settlers were drawn by the valley 's fertility
15 as mill creek valley 's population grew the unincorporated community of purgitsville developed along mill creek as a trading post village;[15][16 it was named for henry purgitt or purgate who acquired 400 acres 160 ha in the mill creek valley on january 7 1785 and received an additional land transfer of 137 acres 55 ha in 1794
14 purgitsville continued to develop throughout the course of the 19th century during which time it grew to include a small store a post office and a blacksmith shop
15]establishment[edit]a church building may have been constructed at the site of old pine church as early as around 1814 and possibly as early as 1792
however the dates of the earliest church can not be verified
15][17]on september 24 1838 william pomkrotz and his wife milly deeded a tract of land to a group of trustees charged with constructing a church or house for public worship for the use and convenience of ministers and others of the christians sic denominations whatsoever
15 while the deed mentioned an existing meeting house on the site there is no extant evidence of a prior structure
15 according to architectural historian sandra scaffidi no particular christian denomination received sole ownership of the edifice which suggests that the church was intended to serve as a nondenominational union church
15][17 the church 's earliest resident minister was reportedly nicholas leatherman whose wife elizabeth high was the daughter of george high one of the church 's original trustees
15]brethren affiliation[edit]few records of the church 's history exist possibly because no single denomination or organization took ownership
15][17 several christian denominations held meetings at old pine church including the schwarzenau brethren or german baptist brethren which began holding services at the church in the late 19th century
15][17 as many of the mill creek valley 's settlers were of german descent the old pine church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for brethren adherents known as dunkers or dunkards
17][18][19 it is believed that old pine church was also used by german methodists
17 the brethren was a christian denomination of anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance
18 brethren adherents believed only in the new testament and professed no other creeds
18 the interior of old pine church which consists of a single common space for all worshippers also illustrates the building 's connection with the brethren and the denomination 's beliefs regarding slavery
18 according to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the brethren in franklin county virginia it has been unanimously considered that it can not be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase negroes or keep them as slaves
 18 while many residents in hampshire county prior to the american civil war were slaveholders it is thought that brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor
18]the brethren denomination had been present in the south branch potomac river valley from as early as the 1750s although records of early brethren congregations are not extant possibly because they were served by peripatetic ministers
18 as early as 1785 two brothers with the surname of powers led a brethren congregation in the area
20 in dr. emmert f. bittinger 's historical research on the brethren church in hampshire county in his allegheny passage 1990 it is noted that the church of the brethren denomination recognized old pine church as belonging to the larger beaver run congregation which was centered approximately 10 miles 16 km south of old pine church
18 the beaver run congregation was the first organization of the brethren in hampshire county
19 old pine church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the beaver run congregation because the distance was too considerable to traverse between the northern region of the mill creek valley and the church on beaver run
18 thus old pine church began as a mission of the beaver run congregation
20][21 because of its location in the vicinity of the hardy county boundary line old pine church congregation 's district spanned both counties
21]by 1870 old pine church was primarily used exclusively by the brethren denomination
17 around 1870 the nicholas congregation of brethren were in use of the church led by dr. leatherman
21 according to the beaver run church book membership at old pine church was 78 in 1879 and numbered 100 in 1881
18 the beaver run congregation modified its district 's boundaries in 1879 which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at old pine church into two factions white pine church of the brethren and old pine church
18 both churches continued to worship at old pine church at different times
18 white pine church of the brethren worshiped at the church from the 1870s until the construction of their own church building in 1907
18][20][22 old pine church continued to utilize the church and worship there
18][22
by 1897 old pine church remained under collective ownership by several christian denominations although the brethren were the church 's largest shareholders
21 white pine church of the brethren remained listed in the brethren conference minutes as pine church until 1912 when members of the church petitioned the brethren conference to change their name from pine to white pine
 18]old pine church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship
17][23 a small one room addition to the church was constructed to the north façade of the building which served as the boarding room for the school 's teacher
23 the old pine church also continued to be used for funeral services and reunions
20]restoration[edit]in 1968 residents of the purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to conduct a restoration of old pine church
it is probable that during this restoration the boarding room addition was removed from the church structure there are no extant remains of the addition
during the restoration the church 's unpainted weatherboards were painted a new roof was installed the original windows were repaired and the original wood floor was replaced
the pressed metal ceiling may have been added during the restoration
23]current use[edit]as of 2012 old pine church is still used for community gatherings funeral services revival meetings and an annual church service
17][23 regular church services have not taken place in the church since the middle of the 20th century
23 the church 's adjacent cemetery also continues to be used for burials
23 throughout its existence old pine church has been known by various names including mill church nicholas church and simply pine church
20][21][24]in 2008 the hampshire county historic landmarks commission and the hampshire county commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the national register of historic places following a series of surveys of historic properties throughout the county
25 the county received funding for the surveying and documentation of hampshire county architecture and history from the state historic preservation office of the west virginia division of culture and history
25 old pine church was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register as a result of the county 's initiative
25 the other seven properties were capon chapel fort kuykendall hickory grove hook tavern north river mills historic district springfield brick house and valley view
25 according to hampshire county commission 's compliance officer charles baker places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register however old pine church and capon chapel were exceptions because both started out as meeting houses
25 old pine church was listed on the national register of historic places on december 12 2012 because of its significant settlement era rural religious architecture in the potomac highlands
15]architecture[edit]church exterior[edit]constructed in 1838 old pine church is a large one story front gable log building
7][25
the church exhibits a symmetrical front façade facing to the west and encompasses a central main entrance consisting of double four paneled doors
7 the main entrance is reached by two concrete steps which are adjoined by a modern metal balustrade
7 a small wooden sign painted white reading old pine church in black lettering is located over the church 's main entrance
7 the main entrance is flanked on either side by one nine over six double hung sash wooden window
7]the church 's side elevations facing toward the north and south feature two symmetrically placed nine over six double hung sash wooden windows
between the two windows on the church 's north elevation is located an exterior concrete block chimney of modern construction
the east rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical in plan and features three nine over six double hung sash wooden windows with the center window placed above the other two windows
the church 's windows have been repaired throughout its history with materials compatible to those originally used
7]beneath each of the church 's four respective corners is a large uncut stone pier
7 along the foundation of the church 's perimeter are located fieldstones which were emplaced at a later date following the building 's construction to discourage intrusion by animals
7 the original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church with some bark remaining on the logs
7 the church is sheathed in brown painted wooden german siding and is crowned by a modern standing seam metal roof
7][25]according to architectural historian sandra scaffidi the simple form and construction of old pine church is indicative of the early settlers access to materials and it serves as an example of the log construction techniques in religious architecture of the hampshire county 's earliest settlers
according to scaffidi old pine church is representative of a simple design and form common to the early ecclesiastical buildings and an excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes
26]church interior[edit]the church 's interior exhibits an open architectural plan
7 against the rear east wall centered underneath the middle window is located a simple wooden frame pulpit
7 the church 's floor consists of pine board that are replacements installed during the church 's 1968 restoration
7][26]the church 's ceiling measures approximately 15 feet 4.6 m in height and is clad in pressed metal panels
a small opening in the ceiling allows for access to the church 's attic
the window wells measure approximately 1 foot 0.30 m and are not flanked by decorative moldings
the interior walls are covered in plasterboard which remains unfinished
26]the church 's small wood burning stove was originally located in the center of the sanctuary but it was relocated to the church 's north wall in later years
the wood burning stove serves as the church 's sole source of heat
26]several of the church 's pews date from 1857 and remain in use
the pews have a minimalist appearance each pew consists of a long wooden plank that serves as the seat with a thin rail supported by three spindles serving as the backrest
the pews are supported by three arched supports which are joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails
the pews of newer fabrication within the church exhibit identical design elements although with modern nails and timber
the pews are arranged against the church 's west elevation with a center aisle
two pews are located on the north elevation with four pews located on the south elevation the pulpit is situated at the east elevation
there is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church
26]cemeteryold pine church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments the oldest section of which is located to the immediate east and south of the church building
26 the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834 but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as 1759
17][20][26 the church 's sign along u.s. route 220 erroneously lists the date of the cemetery 's oldest interment sites as dating to 1792
17]the cemetery 's headstones are oriented both to the east and to the west
26 the majority are simple in design inscribed with birth and death dates and consist of a combination of rounded arched stones rectangular stones and pyramidal shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone
in the cemetery 's southern section are a number of small rectangular stones that probably serve as footstones
beginning around 1950 the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop roughly cut stone foundations
old pine church 's cemetery is surrounded by several mature trees with a large oak tree overhanging the southwestern area of the cemetery
outside of the national register of historic places boundary to the northwest of old pine church lies a second parcel of land acquired around 1950 for additional burials
the cemetery is enclosed by a chicken wire fence supported by wooden posts with a large cattle gate to the north of the church which allows machinery access into the cemetery
