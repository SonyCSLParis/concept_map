the rush started at sutter 's mill near coloma california on january 24 1848 when james w. marshall an employee of sacramento agriculturist john sutter found a gold nugget
sutter wanted to suppress this fact because he was more concerned with expanding his utopian ideal of an agricultural empire than finding fortune in the cold american river
but rumors soon surfaced and confirmed by san francisco newspaper publisher and merchant samuel brannan and the inevitable wave of immigration from around the world called the 49ers soon invaded what would soon be called the gold country of california

like many cities of the 19th century the infrastructures of san francisco and other boom towns near the fields were strained by the sudden influx leftover cigar boxes and planks served as a sidewalk and crime became a problem causing vigilantes to rise up and serve the populace in the absence of police
