stephen hill and african americans in the gold rush in september 1854 owen r. rozier complained to the san joaquin republican that his slave stephen spencer hill had escaped from the steamer urilda the night before rozier and hill were to set sail for arkansas
further rozier alleged that hill had stolen his gold watch and thirteen dollars in cash
slavery in the gold rush"mr
rozier is still in this city at the st. charles where he would be glad to receive any information of the fugitive the newspaper read
liberatedit 's doubtful rozier got much help
stephen spencer hill 's escape was no fluke but a plan concocted by his white neighbors to free him
known as the gold spring boys hill 's neighbors did n't believe he was rozier 's property
they had spent months trying to extricate hill from the white man 's clutches
court ruled against hill california was a free state but under state and federal laws a fugitive slave could be captured and returned to his owner
rozier claimed he was the agent for wood tucker of arkansas who had brought hill to california
hill did n't have the paperwork to prove he was a free man and a judge ruled in rozier 's favor
white southerners brought black slaves into the california mines as early as the summer of 1849
slave owners and slaves came primarily from western u.s. states texas mississippi missouri arkansas
among them were stephen spencer hill and wood tucker who mined near columbia
slavery was n't popular in the mines but there were no laws barring it in the early days of the gold rush
statehoodin washington congress was embroiled in a rancorous debate over whether the land acquired during the war with mexico including california would be admitted to the union as free or slave states
the nation was evenly divided with 15 states free and 15 states slaveholding
california would tip the balance in one direction or the other
delegates declared california a free state by september of 1849 californians were tired of waiting for the federal government to act on the matter of their statehood
forty eight state delegates gathered in monterey and voted to join the union
many of california 's delegates were from slave states but they were also miners
they had experienced the hard physical toil of digging for gold and the majority thought slavery an unfair advantage in the mines
they declared california a free state writing into the constitution neither slavery nor involuntary servitude unless for punishment of crimes shall ever be tolerated in this state
 threat of dissolution with the north and the south at an impasse california 's demand for admission as a free state raised the specter of dissolution of the union
where is the line to be drawn
what states are to secede
what is to remain american
what am i to be an american no longer
 asked massachusetts senator daniel webster
the debate went on for six months
at one point one senator drew a pistol on another
the compromise finally congress reached the compromise of 1850 under which california entered the union under the state delegates terms
new mexico and utah also became territories without determining whether they would be free or slave states
the slave trade was banned from the district of columbia and the fugitive slave law was tightened
whatever party may prevail hereafter the union stands firm said webster
anti slavery not anti racistthe monterey delegates who made california a free state did so largely on the basis of the mining economy
they did not extend civil rights to california 's african americans or native americans
both groups were denied the right to vote and the right to testify in court
one delegate had even rallied substantial support for banning blacks from california altogether but the provision was dropped from the constitution
in 1852 california passed its own version of the fugitive slave law allowing white slave owners to reclaim escaped black slaves
