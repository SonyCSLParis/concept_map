the sun never set on the british empire,"dominion over palm and pine"some chronicler speaking of asia asserted that one man ruled as much land as the sun passed and his statement was not true because he placed all africa and europe outside the limits where the sun rises in the east and sets in the west
it has now however turned out to be true
your possession is equal to what the sun can pass and the sun passes over your land

all british possessions are listed below
the information on the diagram is basically that shown on a commemorative plate that was produced for the coronation of george vi in 1937
an image of the plate is in the horizon history of the british empire edited by stephen w. sears
american heritage publishing bbc time life books mcgraw hill book company 1973
the coronation year is also noteworthy for a handsome redesign of british coinage where we get touches like a little wren on the farthing a coin that sadly because of inflation was discontinued after 1956 and demonetized in 1960
the time zones on the diagram themselves may be said to be artifacts of the british empire since they are based on the meridian of greenwich at the original royal observatory 1675 1953 in london as seen in the image at right where the building to the right contains the meridian transit instrument that defines the line of zero longitude
since 1884 this has been the internationally accepted prime meridian for the calculation of longitude
the animation may also be used to inspect the operation of the international dateline which divides the -12h/+12h time zone
animation may be stopped either with the stop key or the esc key although not all browers respond to these instructions
it is interesting to note that although several places in the pacific might fall into the -12h time zone the dateline itself and the boundaries of the -11h zone are today drawn in such a way that no jurisdiction uses the -12h zone tonga formerly british uses +12h midway island the aleutians use -11h
some time zone boundaries have been changed since 1937
the gambia no longer seems to be in the -1h time zone
also there have been several time zones that are at a half hour rather than a whole hour interval from greenwich including today india +5h30 m burma +6h30 m and central australia +9h30 m
my source for the 1937 zones in the atlas of the british empire edited by christopher bayly facts on file 1989 p.246 does not clearly indicate these variations so no attempt is made to represent them
the british empire was not a de jure entity like the roman empire german empire austrian empire russian empire or japanese empire since britain itself was a kingdom the united kingdom of great britain and ireland or northern ireland in 1937
one british possession however was an empire namely india where british rule comes to be called the raj or
queen victoria became empress of india in 1876
the formal british adoption of india as an empire however was seen at the time as a response to bismark 's creation of the german empire 1871
the british empire usually means on the other hand not something in relation to the empire of india but the whole of british colonial possessions spread around the world
empire had been used this way long before there was any 19th century ideology on the subject for it or against it
but as an empire british possessions do not look much like rome china or russia which were geographically continguous with simple continuous borders
instead the british empire was functionally a bit more like the later holy roman empire whose fragmentation and particularism a jury rig in british nautical terms gravely compromised such power as we might expect of the whole
as john darwin said recently the british presided over a ramshackle empire full of contradictions and quirks and with a control apparatus that was spasmodic at best unfinished empire the global expansion of britain bloomsbury press 2012 p.194
the power of britain at its height was almost entirely a function of that of great britain itself as the power of the later holy rome emperors was almost entirely a function of that of the hapsburgs
most would not consider this a flattering characterization of britain 's achievement since the holy roman empire was famously in voltaire 's words neither holy nor roman nor an empire
yet when emperor leopold i had to make a deal with the margrave of brandenburg just to get him to fulfill his feudal duty to support the emperor in the war of the spanish succession in 1701 this does not sound too different from the difficulties that britain faced in world war i and world war ii to obtain the full participation of the dominions in those wars
it was not a foregone conclusion especially for south africa and ireland that they would participate at all
by 1939 australia and new zealand had long been expressing reservations about involvement in another european war and this line of thinking was only cut short when it became clear that a direct threat from japan was a reflex of the european situation
when britain was then unable to stop the japanese australia and new zealand formed ties with the united states that soon rivaled in sentiment at least those for britain
ireland had created a presidency in 1937 and thus by ordinary calculation became a republic
since it was not offically called that just éire its status remained ambiguous
unambiguous irish neutrality in world war ii however pretty much cleared that up especially when prime minister de valera offered condolences at the german embassy in 1945 for the death of adolf hitler without a comparable gesture for franklin roosevelt
leaving the commonwealth in 1949 removed any remaining ties to britain
the growing and troublesome autonomy of the dominions was a function of their geographical detachment and distance from the mother country
their advance to self government almost inevitably spelled functional alienation first in principle and then increasingly in practice
thus john darwin says the existence of so many dependencies over whose internal affairs london had almost no control mystified both foreign observers and much opinion in britain for whom a colony as they were still called was a colony and responsible government a constitutional riddle p.390
what the hell kind of empire is it when you do n't even rule parts of it
the growth of the united states for instance during the same period did not produce the same problems since even distant new foundations like california remained politically and constitutionally integrated with the whole adding an unambiguous increment of wealth and power to the nation
but britain barely considered constitutional intregration of colonies into great britain
its initial instinct to hold colonies in thrall led to the american revolution and the alienation of its first and most promising colonies
its later approach with gradual grants of autonomy kept the dominions happier and willingly faithful longer but ultimately had the same practical effect as by the end of world war ii they were all functioning as fully independent states
the dynamic of this fragemenation i have examined elsewhere
while india was the jewel in the crown of the empire its role in british power was also unlike the possessions of more conventional empires
it was not geographically historically culturally racially or religiously contiguous with great britain
it was the seat of an entirely different and ancient civilization with a vastly larger population than all the rest of british domains put together and the british were always determined to maintain a distance and a separation from it
the british empire could therefore have never gone the way of the roman empire where eventually all free inhabitants came to enjoy a common citizenship and a common participation in the political military cultural and religious life of the whole
in time rome even underwent a religious revolution in the triumph of christianity which had grown up out of the disparate non latin elements of the empire
the british liked to think of themselves as modern romans but a fate comparable to rome where india would have dominated britain demographically politically and perhaps even religiously was not something they were willing to contemplate
yet the dynamic of british ideology and practice was headed in that direction and could only be forestalled by arbitrary and incoherent barriers
thus 19th century britain when it realized that it was not just out to make money but had come to assume the moral responsibility of ruling millions of people in their own interest came to see itself as on a civilizing mission and soon began in earnest to educate and assimilate indians and later africans chinese etc in all the terms of modern life science liberty free enterprise democracy etc
the historian thomas babington macaulay looked forward to a class of persons indian in blood and colour but english in taste in opinion in morals and in intellect
 liberals like john stuart mill could get behind this project and bless british india as a paragon of virtue and altruism
christianity ironically in light of its roman origin was also thrown in there but official support for conversions was toned down after the mutiny 1857 1858
it was not many decades however before a western educated and alarmingly anglicized indian elite came into being
by all the ordinary dynamics of empire or at least roman empire an educated indian could be expected to circulate freely among englishmen possess the same dignity and freedom as other subjects of queen victoria and reasonably be expected to participate in the government of his own country as many british had already said that modernized indians could be expected to do
indeed queen victoria 's proclamation after the mutiny included the principle that perfect equality was to exist so far as all appointments were concerned between europeans and natives

so if a barrier was to be maintained how was that going to work
one approach was to deny that the anglicized elite had any more business ruling the natives than the british
frederick lugard governor general of nigeria 1912 1919 thought that the british should rule indirectly through traditional local rulers and so he said it is a cardinal rule of british colonial policy that the interests of a large native population shall not be subject to the will either of a small european class or of a small minority of educated and europeanised natives who have nothing in common with them and whose interests are often opposed to theirs
this policy however perverse could be partially maintained in india after the mutiny by way of the princely states but much of india already was ruled directly by the british crown
what could possibly prevent queen victoria 's promise of equal appointments from being fulfilled in that case
unfortunately the spirit of the age contributed the impediment racism
if the non white races were inherently inferior physically morally or intellectually to whites then an englishman was not simply interchangeable with a modern educated indian or african etc however jumped up and anglophile their language education or appearance might be
there was still going to be something weak nasty and inferior lurking within
it is easily forgotten now that this was the spirit of the age
social darwinism was not just a hostile label applied by the enemies of capitalism
in 1912 karl pearson professor of eugenics at university college london published darwinism medical progress and parentage
eugenics remained popular in some circles for decades and not just in nazi germany
what sound like eugenic questions still arise over the results of iq tests although professor pearson probably would have been disconcerted that jews tend to score the best among whites while chinese japanese and other east asians tend to score the highest overall
this was not the hierarchy that victorian let alone nazi racists would have expected although nothing to surprise a particular kind of japanese nationalist
the ugly principle of race spelled the doom of the british empire for the british ultimately knew better and there was the incoherent circumstance that indian subjects in britain could actually be elected to parliament as was dadabhai naoroji 1825 1917 in 1892
if indians were racially inferior and could not be trusted to rule their own country how could one of them become a member of parliament in britain itself
and then it was exceedingly awkward after world war ii to maintain racial barriers and racist ideology when britain had needed to rally support to defeat the ultimate exemplar and advocate of racist ideology nazi germany
to the extent that hitler actually admired the power and racism of the british empire he helped to destroy it
yet the racism was already doomed as it was in the united states by its inconsistency as noted with english principles of individual liberty personal dignity and natural rights as already sharply ennunciated contra slavery itself by thomas jefferson
someone like mohandas gandhi could feel this inconsistency in the most personal way after he had enjoyed the easy equality and personal friendships of his life in london while he was a law student in the middle temple and then experienced the color barrier and personal insults sometimes from the same individuals after he had returned to india
yet even gandhi remained a supporter of british liberal principles in the law and the empire for many years
only slowly did he come to believe that the denial of independence to india rested only on the worse aspects of british ideology but then he also realized that he could undermine british confidence and resolve precisely by appealing to the better angels of the british character
prejudice and snubs against the wogs and n****rs were not only rude they were just not fair play something a gentleman should not tolerate
this proved to be a most effective strategy
while it was assumed by one and all that india added a substantial increment to british power and perhaps even constituted a major portion of what was needed by britain for great power status the economic development of the country even after the growth fostered by british investment and modernization was so relatively backward that there was little that india which certainly had been one of the great powers of the earth in the 16th century contributed in modern terms
the most conspicuous symbol of british power of india was its army which in 1881 contained 69,647 british and 125,000 indian troops
darwin op.cit
p.326
since this was the largest concentration of british troops anywhere in the world surpassing great britain itself with 65,809 troops and it was paid for by indian revenues the british benefited in that they did not need to pay for these forces themselves
however the british garrison in india was there in large part to secure india and prevent another mutiny not to otherwise be used for british military purposes
in the sphere of influence of the indian government the indian army british and native could be used for local purposes
this sphere stretched from china southeast asia and burma to the middle east including the persian gulf and aden to east africa
in those terms britain was riding an indian empire that might be functioning much as it would as a regional power if the british were n't even there
a few indian troops were used in europe in world war i but the value of the indian army was otherwise within the range we might expect in mesopotamia in world war
i and then malaya and burma in world war ii
the independence of india in 1947 thus did remove a kind of keystone to the whole arch of british influence in south asia and the indian ocean
india was not going to pay for any part of the british army anymore
what this looks like in retrospect then is that if india had ever truly been integrated with britain and had ever achieved anything like the same level of economic development the whole would have had the potential to be a superpower on the level of the united states or certainly the soviet union
but there was never any realistic chance of anything of the sort and even in 2013 india is still struggling to emerge as a great power in its own right for the first time since the moghuls
it has n't quite made it yet and this puts in stark relief the limitations of what it could contribute to the british empire in the days of the raj
despite the informal and even confused nature of the larger british empire the term imperial worked its way into various official terminology about british possessions e.g. the imperial general staff and the imperial war museum
 when india and pakistan became independent in 1947 the indian empire ceased to exist and both countries became for a time dominions the category for previous british self governing territories starting with canada 1867 and later coming to include the commonwealth of australia new zealand the union of south africa and for a time 1926 1934 little newfoundland which did not join canada until 1949
as the empire faded the british commonwealth took over though that organization seemed to offer less and less as time went on in terms of real economic military or political advantages
indeed if the holy roman empire was in some ways analogous to the british empire then the commonwealth may be compared to the german confederation of 1815 where there was no pretense that the sovereignty of its members was in the least compromised by the largely symbolic organization of the whole
in retrospect empire was never the best term for the constellation of british possessions
they were never continguous nor unified enough to match the structure let alone the appearance of any of the paradigmatic historical empires
but when we see the string of small naval bases stretching from gibraltar to malta to aden singapore and hong kong this is reminiscent of something significant in classical history
the fetters of greece were the bases demetrias chalchis piraeus and corinth by which hellenistic macedonia enforced its hegemony over greece
and there we find the words
macedon was the hêgemón and it possessed the hêgemonía over greece
this was a status of neither conquest nor rule but it involved varying degrees of control and influence
and there were antecedents to such a structure
the domain of 5th century athens at its height is often called an empire despite the truly farcical inappropriateness of this term when applied to the scale and the structure that athenian power possessed which mostly consisted of the county sized territory of attica plus increasingly unwilling allies coerced into the fiction of the defensive league of delos
but the greeks knew what to call it and the hegemony possessed by athens then passed to sparta to thebes and finally to macedonia
roman rule by contrast would be direct and comprehensive allowing local government only where this implied absolutely no political freedom of action and no independent military force
the british naval presence around the world and the whole pax britannica were marks of hegemony not of empire
colonies as isolated naval bases grew up as tentpoles of hegemonic power
in those terms india the dominions and then the substantial african colonies were anomalous except that in some ways the greeks had done that also
in america australia new zealand and elsewhere british emigrants settled and founded states just as greek cities founded new cities as colonies in the mediterranean
greek colonies as it happened immediately become autonomous but then with the lag of a few years so did the british dominions
the nineteenth century scramble for africa fleshed out substantial possessions there but this all was a late addition to the hegemonic power substantively founded on bases dominions and that one true empire india
the status of a hegemon is something that we also find very far from greece
in the spring and autumn period of the eastern chou of chinese history the tradition arose that at various times there were dominant rulers among the many states of the era
these were in succession the or the five hegemons
 they did not conquer or rule all the others
indeed that only happened in the following warring states period when the king of ch'in rolled up the remaining states and made china truly an empire
so the hegemons were briefly predominant but they did not create empires
the british empire as consisting of something more like a hegemony is even more illuminating when we come to the predominant power that is widely seen as succeeding to the global status of britain the united states of america itself a daughter of british hegemony
while the role and actions of the united states are routinely called imperialism by the leninist left and the isolationist right the united states has none of the kinds of territorial possessions that were enjoyed by britain
the foreign bases of the united states although many and from which it can project its power beyond what can even be done with its substantial naval forces consist of no sovereign american territory except in the chain of islands midway wake and guam that were acquired in the 19th century in imitation of britain
even something that was sovereign territory the panama canal zone was nevertheless surrendered to panama
one famous or infamous base guantanamo bay in cuba is sovereign cuban territory but was obtained on permanent lease at the time the united states freed cuba from spain
the united states clearly does not have an empire but it is also clearly a hegemon
this status may be as fragile as it was for athens or for britain but the territorial heart of the united states is also a much greater source of power than was that of athens britain the hapsburgs macedon or the typical spring and autumn state
also nato as the equivalent of the league of delos rather than coerced into paying tribute to the hegemon finds that the defense of its members is subsidized by the american taxpayer
the attempt of the french to hold vietnam against the communists was funded by the united states which then inherited the subsequent struggle after the french failure
athens provided no such benefits
whether the united states can sustain such efforts economically or politically is open to question
britain lost not just the will to empire but the power for hegemony
as american strength is confused by internal anti imperialist political opinion and socialist economics even with the soviet union gone and euro socialism collapsing one wonders if it will be moral failure alone that allows the emergence of the power waiting to be the next hegemon china
many americans are alert to all this but much of the electorate still has its eye fixed on the free lunch and the class envy pushed by the orphaned but persistent marxists of american education and the press people whose anti americanism is so perplexingly intense that they are willing to ally themselves with the grotesquely mediaeval ideology of islamic fascism
but that is a separate topic in its own right
in 1909 the british empire encompassed 20 of the land area of the earth and 23 of its population
although the first industrial power by 1900 britain had been surpassed by both united states and by germany but britain was still the financial center of the world and the premier merchant carrier
british trade in 1900 and between 1909 1913 and foreign investment in 1914 is shown in the following table
somewhat different figures for trade are given in cristopher bayly 's atlas of the british empire and t.o. lloyd 's the british empire 1558 1995 and for investment in lloyd and john darwin 's unfinished empire so both sets of figures from are given
where there is disagreement lloyd tends to show slightly greater british exports than bayly but if we add bayly 's figures up for lloyd 's world category we get 315/201 which is slightly smaller exports and much larger imports against 287.3/216.5
nigel dalziel 's the penguin historical atlas of the british empire only gives trade figures for british possessions thus obscuring the predominance of foreign trade in the british economy
we get a hint of leninism in dalziel 's heading for the chapter the country became increasingly dependent on foreign markets to absorb rising industrial output p.94 as though rising output required export
see below
the long term problem of the british economy would be lack of production not lack of markets
between all these sources of course the world gets divided up in different ways and while darwin helpfully gives investment numbers for more specific countries other areas are left out e.g. for europe and the mediterranian darwin only has a number for russia although if lloyd 's number if reliable this accounts for more than half of british investment in the area which means that the russian revolution with all assests seized and bonds defaulted was a grave financial blow
since lloyd does give any numbers for sub saharan africa this leaves us unable to guess what investment was in nigeria the gold coast kenya etc
but it is nice to see the truly massive amount of british investment in argentina larger than both india and australia
britain in this period is running a large trade deficit
this is usually taken as a sign of british decline
however as david hume noted as early as 1752 this really just means that enough money is exported to make up the difference
this would cause a deflation unless enough money is created or brought in for investment to make up the difference
since britain did not experience any deflation after the 1890 's it is fairly clear that the money flows were correcting the balance
this kind of thing was later thought to be indicative of american decline when the united states began to run large trade deficits and in the 1980 's became a net debtor from foreign investment in united states securities
however the dire predictions at the time gave no hint of the relative strength of the united states economy with good growth low unemployment and negligible inflation in the 1990 's with the american advantage over europe and japan increasing in the course of the decade
by 1999 the united states economy was all but carrying atlas like the stagnant or shrinking economies of the rest of the world though it might be said that the financial collapse of 2008 raises new questions about the foundation of the prosperity after 2000
the british balance of trade and balance of payments situation in 1900 thus need not have been an indicator of any real ill health
british decline ultimately had to be from other causes like an absolute decline in innovation and investment at home
indeed when americans in the 1980 's worried about the japanese buying up the united states the largest foreign investors were actually british which for the future meant american growth rather than british growth
another lesson to be read off the trade figures is that a relatively small fraction of british trade involved colonies that would later constitute the third world
 indeed the only trade surpluses in the table are with india africa the west indies and the far east which might give some heart to marxist claims that british colonies especially india were the outlet for capitalist excess production
 however the trade surpluses are small and overall british trade with india and the other colonies is hardly larger than with the much much smaller populations of australia new zealand and canada
no serious argument can be made that the likes of australia and new zealand with their own autonomous governments and protective tariffs were being exploited by great britain
instead the largest british export market is simply with the rest of europe
indeed europe the united states australia canada etc are the places where more people would have enough money to buy british goods
the figures for investment reveal the truth about the thesis first advanced by j.a. hobson in 1902 imperialism and later taken up by lenin that british conquest followed british investment
hobson wished to explain the recent boer war as the effect of £ 400 million of investment in the south african gold and diamond minds
lenin saw british colonies as the necessary outlet for british capital as well as for british capitalist overproduction
 unfortunately if this thesis were true then the british should have been conquering the united states not south africa since the largest single destination of british investment was the americas but canada was the only large scale british possession
but just as hobson and lenin were the kind of people who would never know how to invest capital productively britain itself was losing its previous genius in that area also
in the new gasoline economies of automobiles and airplanes let alone the electronic industries of light and radio britain was never in the lead and never caught up
today queen elizabeth ii is still the official head of state of scattered former possessions such as the solomon islands but the british connection for the remaining dominions canada australia new zealand has been increasingly compromised and questioned with even the term dominion itself passing out of usage
canada has come up with its own flag losing the union jack canton its own national anthem oh canada its own constitution and its own perhaps fatal political division between francophone quebec and all the other sometimes bitterly resentful anglophone provinces resentful in part for the cost of bilingualism mandated for federal business everywhere while quebec restricts or prohibits public uses of english new brunswick is the only province that is officially bilingual
why canada should then continue with a queen 's government or even as a single country is increasingly an open question
when i visited british columbia as a child in 1959 there were union jacks as well as canadian ensigns on sale everywhere for tourists
on my last visits to canada in 1995 at niagara falls and 2004 toronto there were no union jacks to be seen at all but in a park in toronto i did notice a statue of edward vii that had been relocated from delhi
meanwhile australia always resentful of much of what happened in world war i at gallipoli and in world war ii at singapore and in burma contains a powerful movement to become a republic
recently however november 6 1999 this was put to stand up vote and lost so australia will remain a dominion or whatever for a while yet
the british empire in one sense long gone confirmed with the return of hong kong to communist china in 1997 thus continues a slow fade everywhere
at the same time british sovereignty in britain itself becomes increasingly compromised by participation in the ill designed ill considered corrupt and heavy handed euro government of the european community and by separatist movements in scotland wales and as always ireland
one artifact of british influence is the side of the road on which traffic moves
in britain you drive on the left and cars have the steering wheel on the right
it was probably france and united states that established the larger international pattern of driving on the right with the steering wheel on the left
in europe only austria hungary portugal and sweden followed the british pattern the successors to austria hungary czechoslovakia austria and hungary switched to the right ironically only under the occupation or influence of nazi germany
portugal and sweden however switched on their own
elsewhere switches from left to right reflect the decline in british influence
this would appear to be the case with places like china argentina and ethiopia
in former british colonies this is also understandable
however three significant countries still drive on the left without a heritage of british control japan thailand and indonesia i once had a student who after visiting japan positively affirmed that they drove on the right 
otherwise major former british possessions like a large part of africa india pakistan australia new zealand etc preserve the british preference
the indian ocean still looks like a british mare nostrum in terms of driving preference
so what went wrong with the british empire
i have examined in detail elsewhere what went wrong with rome and here i have already compared the british empire to the holy roman empire which might imply a parallel analysis
but if the reality of the power of the later holy roman emperors was actually the power of the hapsburgs and the power of the british empire was britain what happened to that power would britain inevitably be ground down by the greater resources human and material of the superpowers
perhaps
but britain hurried its decline with the dynamic of its own attitudes
for the key to british power was the industrial revolution
this began in britain and in the 19th century it made her the workshop of the world

but that advantage did not last
the spirit of invention and entrepreneurship was often only honored in the breach
the actual individuals responsible for the industrial revolution were typically non conformists i.e. unitarians quakers presbyterians etc scots foreigners and other marginal types
the stolid english squire like uncle matthew radlett in nancy mitford 's books had nothing to do with it
but even uncle matthew with the experience of mitford 's father in india was an internationalist compared to the greatest caricature of the english in english history the hobbits of j.r.r. tolkein 's the lord of the rings 1954 1955
the hobbits have all the stuffy parochial claustrophobic self referential xenophobia of the english squire
yet the portrait is affectionate and tolkein 's characters treasure the insularity of the shire and are grieved when disorders spill over into it at the end of the books
personally enduring two world wars tolkein happy in his oxford college clearly wished for a little england without great power imperial or other international complications
i tend to associate all this with english architecture and design which outside in a city like london seems on a smaller more intimate scale than the avenues of paris or new york while inside we have the jumble of overstuffed furniture and small busy rooms with their floral wallpaper
what many prosperous english merchants really wanted was to make enough money to get out of trade buy land and join the rural aristocracy an aristocracy to whom the working class meant not the marxian proletariat but all those in the grubby business of buying and selling
an english gentleman was by legal definition someone without a regular trade or profession
neither capitalists nor proletarians need apply
this was bad enough and it had its effect
but the empire itself exercised its own corrosive effect on british attitudes
the british empire was said to have been won on the playing fields of eton
but the education of a british public i.e. private school like eton was not an education in engineering or management or finance it was an education in the qualities of command leadership and rule
the british were indeed properly educated to be roman proconsuls and this was something often needed in the colonies but it contributed nothing to the industrial or commercial strength of britain and its very prestige sapped undermined and degraded the material sources of british power
the soviet mole in john le carré 's classic tinker taylor soldier spy
1974 was of a generation raised to rule which then had nothing to rule
he really hated the americans
but that tells the tale
the torch of innovation invention finance etc had been passed to the united states and the british more or less forgot that they had simply dropped that torch as it were as they prepared to rule the wogs for their own good
thus the true strength of britain was in the principles fostered by the 19th century liberal party
yet now only the tories and labour remain the former despite mrs. thatcher still remembering when the sun never set and an englishman could enjoy a good gin and tonic brought by a native servant on his veranda in kenya and the latter certain that those inventors industrialists and financiers were simply exploiting the workers
this became a folie à deux from which no good can ever be expected
in england today it often seems like the most enterprising and hardest working people are immigrants from india
but there is something else about the empire
so much opprobrium towards imperialism today arises either from the leninist view of it which ought to be but is n't always suspect or from a simple moral principle that the british had no right to rule other peoples against their will
against the marxist leninist view that the exploitation of colonies was part of the larger capitalist exploitation of labor there is the sobering truth evident by the eighties that many former british colonies especially the african colonies had been better off economically under the british than they were later
colonies that nationalized industries and fixed prices saw the collapse of industries and the decline of their economies
those that took the most up to date adivce to keep out foreign capital to adopt top down stalinist plans for development and in short to go the progessive route of socialism typically ended up with dictators who practiced what was bitterly called swiss bank account socialism
 eventually anti globalization protesters would be shocked to learn that what third world countries wanted from the world economy was free trade their agricultural products were being kept out by the protectionism of the united states and the european union
but even if the british were better stewards of african economies is n't it still true that they simply did not have the right to rule other people against their will
well i am presently in a democracy ruled by other people against my will
indeed since about 1988 i have not voted for anyone who ended up being elected while those who were elected daily violate the constitution and criminally assault my rights which they all swear an oath to uphold
there is a word for this the tyranny of the majority
so this raises the question is it better to ruled by an irresponsible autocrat who nevertheless institutes justice and righteousness or to be ruled by a corrupt political class that with the justification of an occasional election consists of liars thieves and looters
of course the former is preferable although the problem since plato has always been to identify an autocrat who has the wisdom to rule and not be corrupted by wealth and power
there is no solution to that problem
with the british empire the key question to ask is how it really got started and why so much of it began or continued to consist of little bits like bombay the gambia penang hong kong etc
these were all little defensive pockets in areas where life and property were not otherwise safe
intervention in the hinterlands or with esablished states usually began with the same purposes to secure peace safety property justice and any other conditions necessary for economic activity and development
the pax britannica like the pax romana may have involved some little wars going on someplace most of the time but the overall effect was to render trade and travel safe in a way that they usually had not been previously
with the royal navy ruling the waves pirates and sovereign predators better watch out
after the withdrawl of the heavy imperial hand we have seen what often happens
the most dramatic recent development is the rise of somali pirates after somalia itself lapsed into anarchy
this is not unlike the situation in the mediterranean for many centuries when the barbary pirates were only finally put down by the french occupation of algeria in 1830
this was imperialism doing humanity a favor in the most unambiguous way
and if the somalis or algerians could not live their lives without preying on international shipping it is not clear that they morally retain their right to independence and self rule
in a day when states like iran have returned to mediaeval barbarism it may be time to reconsider the easy and often tendentious self righteousness with which imperialism has been condemned
there is also the fate of a place like ceylon
the removal of the imperial hand releases conflicts that sometimes have been created by the colonial power e.g. jewish immigration into palestine but usually involve much older preexisting problems
thus the conflict between tamils and sinhalese in ceylon long antedates by centuries the arrival of the british or any europeans
under the british however the conflict had been minimized to the extent that most people were not even aware of it and in no fear of its returning
at independence the future of ceylon was hopeful and unclouded
the 1962 world book encyclopedia field enterprises educational corporation chicago said of the majority sinhalese they have gentle habits
volume 3 p.277
yet by then this had all changed
in 1956 a government hostile to the tamils was elected
soon the gentle sinhalese would be burning people alive
the more than 50 years of history since then of the country now called sri lanka has consisted of legal ethnic discrimination fierce riots and a grim nasty protracted civil war which only seems to have been put down in 2009 or at least the principal tamil fighters have been destroyed
although the end of imperialism has resulted in other ethnic conflicts in palestine cyprus kashmir rwanda and elsewhere the sri lankan conflict has been one of the worst most protracted and most perplexing perplexing to many since sinhalese buddhism is supposedly peace loving and tolerant and sympathetic towards all beings including tamils
but no one familiar with ceylonese history where an ancient buddhist judgment was that tamils were not human beings would be deceived about that
a telling moment in the ceylonese conflict was after monolingual tamil bureaucrats were fired in 1964
tamils appealed the discriminatory laws all the way to the privy council in england which still had some residual judicial authority over the dominion of ceylon
the council of course moved to protect the tamils but then the ceylonese government abolished the right of such appeals and quashed any remedy for the tamils
this did not do anyone any good
but that is what the british empire used to be able to do mediate conflicts that unchecked could become slaughters and civil wars
a bit of imperial slaughter was sometimes necessary in such conflicts and are now viewed with horror but we can see the scale to which real slaughter can rise without the empire to give all parties something to fear in common
the british are often blamed for the conflict that resulted from the partition of india but again the elements of the conflict long preexisted the arrival of any europeans
muslims do not like being ruled by non muslims and from mahmud of ghazna to the moghuls they were not
british rule was at least preferable to hindu
in its absence not only did we see the riots and slaughters of 1947 1948 but we subsequently have had several wars and now a nuclear stand off between india and pakistan a pakistan which has generally been subject to military dicatorships in its history and now to islamic radicals and fundamentalism from people the british were already calling the hindustan fanatics
all this again begins to make the empire look not so bad
the ideal would have been something as hume might have said betwixt unity and number
 thus local autonomy would address most issues involved in self rule while some higher authority could have secured the peace and the rights of minorities
in short the sort of federal system that is supposed to characterize the government of the united states
something of the sort was sought by perceptive advocates of imperialism like joseph chamberlain
yet chamberlain insisted on promoting his ideas in terms of the anglo saxon race even though this completely excluded india and can not even have sounded too good in the dominions where elevated percentages of the population were scots or irish
chamberlain forgot to include celts in the greatness and importance of his race
 a federation of the dominions with britain never got off the ground
unfortunately even if it had this sort of structure for government has still not been perfected
if the united states government now assumes all the powers of government and assumes the unlimited powers that were the horror of the founding fathers with an explicit program to do so from the treacherous democratic party it is not clear that the british empire could have done any better
for a while the balance of power between britain and the dominions was a rough version of this but a federalism in theory or practice was never embodied in the relevant laws
yet even in the united states with federalism enumerated powers and limited government clearly and explicitly written into the constitution and the subject of wide discussion and explanation among the founders most political culture in the country and certainly most politicains do not take such things seriously even if they are aware of them and the most ignorant and arrogant politicians are not
james madison himself said that paper barriers would not be enough to secure the system but the design of divided authority and checks and balances has now manifestly failed in the long run to accomplish its purpose with flaws that were aleady wisely discerned by thomas jefferson
in the absence of an effective such system the actual fate of the british empire of the several independence of its members may have been the best as it was the inevitable outcome ters
of course the former is preferable although the problem since plato has always been to identify an autocrat who has the wisdom to rule and not be corrupted by wealth and power
there is no solution to that problem
with the british empire the key question to ask is how it really got started and why so much of it began or continued to consist of little bits like bombay the gambia penang hong kong etc
these were all little defensive pockets in areas where life and property were not otherwise safe
intervention in the hinterlands or with esablished states usually began with the same purposes to secure peace safety property justice and any other conditions necessary for economic activity and development

in the absence of an effective such system the actual fate of the british empire of the several independence of its members may have been the best as it was the inevitable outcome
in the following list of present and former british possessions current british possessions and dependencies are in boldface red current members of the british commonwealth are in plain red and independent states in the commonwealth that retain queen elizabeth as their head of state are followed by a crown
it should be noticed that this crown uses cross pieces that original signified the crown of the holy roman empire
such a structure indeed was then adopted by other monarchies and is a feature of british crowns although i have bent them downward to signify the difference
the development of monarchical rank and hierarchy is examined elsewhere
the list of princely states in india is complete according to wikipedia but i also see that there were something like 600 of them which is nothing like what you see here
i have added the information wikipedia also provides for the rank of the ruler and the number of salutes to be fired as granted by the british some rulers used higher numbers in their own domains as of 1947
there are a few inconsistencies between the different lists including differences in spelling
i could not identify some rulers on the salute list in the list of states which confirms some doubts about completeness
but with some possible anomalies this will certainly give you the idea
lists of rulers have now also been provided for several princely states linked from the index here
the issue of the princely states is of some interest
by the time of independence they were clearly an anachronism and indian nationalist leaders often thought that the british kept them around like some sort of circus freaks for their amusement
however the princes were the forces on the ground from the dying moghul empire and not at all anachronistic in the 18th century and the british were steadily liquidating them in the 19th when the mutiny stopped the process
as time passed it was inevitable that they became living fossils but someone like lord mountbatten the last viceroy who had genuine personal friendships with many of them was sorely grieved to inform them that british protection was finished and they would need to go with india or pakistan
he felt that this was a breach of faith and perhaps it was but an inevitable one
