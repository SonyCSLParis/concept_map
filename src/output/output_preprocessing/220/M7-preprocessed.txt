british empire the first empire the origins of the empire date from the late 16th cent with the private commercial ventures chartered and encouraged by the crown of chartered companies
these companies sometimes had certain powers of political control as well as commercial monopolies over designated geographical areas
usually they began by setting up fortified trading posts but where no strong indigenous government existed the english gradually extended their powers over the surrounding area
in this way scattered posts were established in india and the east indies for spices coffee and tea defying portuguese and later dutch hegemony and in newfoundland for fish and hudson bay for furs where the main adversaries were the french
in the 17th cent
european demand for sugar and tobacco led to the growth of plantations on the islands of the caribbean and in se north america
these colonies together with those established by roman catholics and protestant dissenters in ne north america attracted a considerable and diversified influx of european settlers
organized by chartered companies the colonies soon developed representative institutions evolving from the company governing body and modeled on english lines
the need for cheap labor to work the plantations fostered the growth of the african slave trade
new chartered companies secured posts on the african coasts as markets for captured slaves from the interior
an integrated imperial trade arose involving the exchange of african slaves for west indian molasses and sugar english cloth and manufactured goods and american fish and timber
to achieve the imperial self sufficiency required by prevailing theories of mercantilism and more immediately to increase british wealth and naval strength the navigation acts were passed restricting colonial trade exclusively to british ships and making england the sole market for important colonial products
developments in the late 17th and early 18th cent were characterized by a weakening of the spanish and dutch empires exposing their territories to british encroachment and by growing anglo french rivalry in india canada and africa
at this time the british government attempted to assert greater direct control over the expanding empire
in the 1680s the revision of certain colonial charters to bring the north american and west indian colonies under the supervision of royal governors resulted in chronic friction between the governors and elected colonial assemblies
the early 18th cent saw a reorganization and revitalization of many of the old chartered companies
in india from the 1740s to 1763 the british east india company and its french counterpart were engaged in a military and commercial rivalry in which the british were ultimately victorious
the political fragmentation of the mughal empire permitted the absorption of one area after another by the british
the treaty of paris 1763 see under paris treaty of firmly established the british in india and canada but the financial burdens of war involved the government in difficulties with the american colonies
the success of the american revolution marked the end of the first british empire
