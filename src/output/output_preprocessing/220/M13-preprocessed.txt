re why does great britain get the best infantry and the most infantry
quote originally posted by vowlesy view post drakon what valuable resources were left in europe
apart from pride the worlds wealth was elsewhere
as the dutch found out in the 1500s-1700s and the british from 1780 to 1960 odd
one word agriculture more food = more soldiers
a reason why france for instance did nt see colonial empires as must have during the ancient régime
france was rich enough to sustain a big army without colonies
our kings saw the colonies only are a bonus and napoléon did nt believe in them at all
they were all wrong)note the french had a colonial empire and a rather big one too 12,347,000 km² 4,767,000 sq miles for the french against 13,000,000 square miles 33,670,000 km² 13,000,000 sq miles for the british empire modest yes but still
