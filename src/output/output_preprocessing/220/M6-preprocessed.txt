story empire navy and tradescene the east india company the east india company formed the foundation stone of the british empire
the company first established a trading post through the port of bantam on the indonesian island of java
initially the company was formed just to trade
but it soon realised that competition from the dutch and french meant it needed to secure and protect trading posts on the indian subcontinent
in order to build its posts the company began to buy land from the indian rulers
in order to protect them it established its own army and navy
by following this policy britain soon became the dominant power in india
its boundaries expanded as the british applied pressure to neighbouring states for military alliances and commercial access
the east india company developed a number of trade routes that dominated commerce between britain and asia until the early nineteenth century
these new trade routes became the catalyst for important cultural changes at home
tea from china was one of the company 's key contributions to life in britain
a variety of spices textiles and porcelain from the whole of asia created significant changes culturally and economically
in 1813 for example customs duty on tea accounted for one tenth of the british government 's annual revenue

this image is perhaps surprising to us today as its illustrates how the east india company had servicemen who were allied to the government and represented british interests

the army of predominantly peasant labourers from bengal brought down british authority across northern india
the cost in terms of human suffering was immense
it also meant that the east india company became unsustainable and by 1858 it dissolved
the administration of india then became the responsibility of the crown
