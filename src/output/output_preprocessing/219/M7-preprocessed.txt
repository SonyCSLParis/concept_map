the manhattan project the making of the atomic bomb during world war 2the atomic bomb produced by the manhattan project in september 1938 the world was again on the brink of war
nazi germany demanded to annex a large part of its neighbour czechoslovakia
czechoslovakia 's allies thought that by betraying it to hitler they would keep the peace
they were wrong
five months later two publications in scientific magazines declared that atoms of the chemical element uranium were successfully broken into smaller atoms by being hit with neutrons a process which also released significant energy
the authors of the two separate publications were actually one team of scientists who worked together for many years but two members lise meitner and otto robert frisch were jews who had to escape from the violent persecusion of jews in nazi germany as did other prominent jewish physicists who previously worked in germany including the most prominent of them all albert einstein
nazi germany was not sorry to see some of the world 's brightest scientists escape
the scientific breakthroughs made in nuclear physics starting with einstein 's 1905 theory of relativity were so revolutionary and so advanced in comparison with classic physics and the contribution of jewish scientists in that field so prominent that many in the german academic community and in the nazi regime considered the whole thing as jewish physics false science
they were wrong
chain reaction the idea that releasing energy from atoms could hypothetically result in a huge explosion was not new
what was so dramatic about the new discovery which frisch called nuclear fission was that when hit by neutrons some of the uranium atoms would break and would release both energy and additional neutrons which could hit neighbouring uranium atoms and that could result in a continued chain reaction
if designed and implemented properly such chain reaction could result in a huge explosion a mighty bomb that would dwarf all other weapons
most of the physicists in britain at that time were already pulled into the military research and development effort focusing on new technologies as radar
the few who could still devote their time to nuclear physics where those who lacked security clearance including the jewish refugees from nazi germany
during 1939 and early 1940 frisch who was stuck in britain because of the war and german born rudolf peierls worked on the practical calculations of what it would take to actually create an atomic bomb
it was originally assumed by most physicists that many tons of uranium would be needed for a bomb making it impractical as a weapon
but frisch and peierls correctly calculated that if the rare uranium 235 isotope of uranium will be used then just a few kilograms of it would be enough to create a chain reaction a bomb
they also correctly calculated the explosive power of such a bomb as equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite
a year after the discovery of nuclear fission in march 1940 frisch and peierls wrote their findings in a memorandum that was passed to sir henry tizard the head of britain 's air defense related scientific research
this led to the creation of a committee to evaluate the military application of uranium detonation maud
a second method for creating an atomic bomb was then suggested by scientists which fled occupied france
the 2nd method did not require extracting the rare uranium 235 from the natural uranium metal
instead it suggested to convert some of the natural uranium to plutonium which would then be separated from the uranium and which could also produce chain reaction
over a year of scientific and industrial evaluation and research had passed when on july 15 1941 with hitler 's victorious army advancing towards moscow and the usa still trying to remain isolated from the war the british maud committee delivered its final report
it said that an atomic bomb was feasible and detailed methods and costs and that it was urgent because it was believed that germany where nuclear fission was discovered was working on such a bomb
in response the british atomic bomb project code named tube alloys was started
while the usa was still isolated from world war 2 there was minimal progress there
on august 2nd 1939 six months after the published discovery of nuclear fission in uranium and just before world war 2 started in europe three hungarian jewish physicists who previously participated in nuclear physics research in german universities and then fled from german nazism to the usa decided that the us president must be warned of the danger that germany will develop an atomic bomb
they approached albert einstein the world 's most famous physicist and convinced him to join them in warning the president
the einstein szilard letter reached president roosevelt who started a secret advisory committee on the subject with a token budget of $ 6,000
later in the summer of 1941 meetings between british and american physicists helped speed things in the us nuclear research and political decision making
in october 1941 president roosevelt approved an american nuclear bomb development project to be managed by the us army
the manhattan project
and then at the end of 1941 the usa was at war
by then two years after the original discovery of nuclear fission in uranium it was clear that an atomic bomb was scientifically feasiable and it was believed that the allies were two years behind the germans in the race to build atomic bombs the war winning super weapon
the american and british atomic projects were combined
the us army corps of engineers project leadrship was located at an office in manhattan new york which gave the entire project its unofficial but well known name the manhattan project
the project progressed still somewhat slowly until vannevar bush the head of the us office of scientific research and development decided that aggressively efficient leadership was required and on spetember 23 1942 leslie groves an army engineer who distinguished himself in overseeing the initial construction of the pentagon was appointed to command the manhattan project
the production of an atomic bomb was scientifically feasible but the task still ahead was immense both in scale and in difficulty
the main tasks of the manhattan project were to acquire unusually large quantities of uranium ore under the limitations of war time
develop engineering methods for industrial scale separation of the rare less than 1
uranium 235 needed for the bomb from the uranium mass
the process called uranium enrichment develop methods for converting uranium to plutonium in what we now call a nuclear reactor and then for separation of the plutonium from the remaining uranium
technically design the actual uranium 235 bomb mechanism which would have to create the precise physical conditions what is called critical mass required to successfully initiate the neutron based chain reaction and to initiate it so fast that the chain reaction would be completed before the initial released energy would just melt the bomb
technically design the actual plutonium bomb mechanism which required even greater complexity precision and much faster initialtion than the uranium 235 bomb
rapidly build all the facilities required for the project including the production of entirely new types of complex machines and devices find and recruit the personnel for the immense project which eventually employed over 130,000 people most of them highly skilled workers and brilliant engineers and scientists in multiple fields of science and technology not just nuclear physics and do that during war time when such people are also demanded by other war time efforts
keep the immense project totally secret so that even its existence will not be known to the enemy
for these tasks several city size top secret isolated installations were built from scratch enriched uranium with 90 uranium 235 isotope was produced in a huge factory at oak ridge tennessee
plutonium was produced in a huge factory at hanford washington
the bomb mechanisms were developed and built at a huge lab at los alamos new mexico under the leadership of j. robert oppenheimer the project 's scientific director
atomic bombs under groves and oppenheimer 's leadership
the immense project overcame all the difficulties and in less than three years it produced three atomic bombs
one was used in a live test on july 16 1945 which produced an explosion equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives
the other two one uranium 235 bomb and one plutonium bomb were dropped on two japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki and practically levelled them killing most of the population either by blast heat radiation or radiation pollution which continued to kill people years later
in response the shocked japanese leadership surrendered and world war 2 finally ended
insights from the manhattan project japan would have been defeated by continued conventional war but that would have undoubtedly cost the lives of many millions more mostly japanese civilians whose lives were saved by the atomic bombs which ended the war
in the post war decades the world witnessed a massive nuclear arms race and a grave danger of sudden destruction of mankind by a massive nuclear war but the awareness of political and military leaders of the mutually assured destruction saved mankind from that
however mankind still face the challenge of keeping the atomic bomb only in storage and out of the reach of those who will use it to make war not to end war
it all started from an obscure discovery in a physics experiment
despite understanding the military potential and being warned of the great danger that nazi germany would develop the bomb first stepping from awareness to massive action took years a potentially fatal delay
the racist arrogance of the nazis whose hate of jews made them dismiss the most advanced field of science as nonsense cost them their chance to win the war
