manhattan project making atomic bomb world war 2the atomic bomb produce manhattan project september 1938 world brink war
nazi germany demand annex large neighbour czechoslovakia
czechoslovakia ally think betray hitler peace
wrong
month later publication scientific magazine declare atom chemical element uranium successfully break small atom hit neutron process release significant energy
author separate publication actually team scientist work year member lise meitner otto robert frisch jews escape violent persecusion jews nazi germany prominent jewish physicist previously work germany include prominent albert einstein
nazi germany sorry world bright scientist escape
scientific breakthrough nuclear physic start einstein 1905 theory relativity revolutionary advanced comparison classic physic contribution jewish scientist field prominent german academic community nazi regime consider thing jewish physics false science
wrong
chain reaction idea release energy atom hypothetically result huge explosion new
dramatic new discovery frisch call nuclear fission hit neutron uranium atom break release energy additional neutron hit neighbour uranium atom result continued chain reaction
design implement properly chain reaction result huge explosion mighty bomb dwarf weapon
physicist britain time pull military research development effort focus new technology radar
devote time nuclear physic lack security clearance include jewish refugee nazi germany
1939 early 1940 frisch stuck britain war german bear rudolf peierls work practical calculation actually create atomic bomb
originally assume physicist ton uranium need bomb make impractical weapon
frisch peierls correctly calculate rare uranium 235 isotope uranium kilogram create chain reaction bomb
correctly calculate explosive power bomb equivalent thousand ton dynamite
year discovery nuclear fission march 1940 frisch peierls write finding memorandum pass sir henry tizard head britain air defense relate scientific research
lead creation committee evaluate military application uranium detonation maud
second method create atomic bomb suggest scientist fled occupy france
2nd method require extract rare uranium 235 natural uranium metal
instead suggest convert natural uranium plutonium separate uranium produce chain reaction
year scientific industrial evaluation research pass july 15 1941 hitler victorious army advance moscow usa try remain isolated war british maud committee deliver final report
say atomic bomb feasible detailed method cost urgent believe germany nuclear fission discover work bomb
response british atomic bomb project code name tube alloys start
usa isolate world war 2 minimal progress
august 2nd 1939 month publish discovery nuclear fission uranium world war 2 start europe hungarian jewish physicist previously participate nuclear physics research german university flee german nazism usa decide president warn danger germany develop atomic bomb
approach albert einstein world famous physicist convince join warn president
einstein szilard letter reach president roosevelt start secret advisory committee subject token budget $ 6,000
later summer 1941 meeting british american physicist help speed thing nuclear research political decision making
october 1941 president roosevelt approve american nuclear bomb development project manage army
manhattan project
end 1941 usa war
year original discovery nuclear fission uranium clear atomic bomb scientifically feasiable believe allies year germans race build atomic bomb war win super weapon
american british atomic project combine
army corps engineers project leadrship locate office manhattan new york give entire project unofficial know manhattan project
project progress somewhat slowly vannevar bush head office scientific research development decide aggressively efficient leadership require spetember 23 1942 leslie groves army engineer distinguish oversee initial construction pentagon appoint command manhattan project
production atomic bomb scientifically feasible task ahead immense scale difficulty
main task manhattan project acquire unusually large quantity uranium ore limitation war time
develop engineering method industrial scale separation rare 1
uranium 235 need bomb uranium mass
process call uranium enrichment develop method convert uranium plutonium nuclear reactor separation plutonium remain uranium
technically design actual uranium 235 bomb mechanism create precise physical condition call critical mass require successfully initiate neutron base chain reaction initiate fast chain reaction complete initial release energy melt bomb
technically design actual plutonium bomb mechanism require great complexity precision fast initialtion uranium 235 bomb
rapidly build facility require project include production entirely new type complex machine device find recruit personnel immense project eventually employ 130,000 people highly skilled worker brilliant engineer scientist multiple field science technology nuclear physic war time people demand war time effort
immense project totally secret existence know enemy
task city size secret isolate installation build scratch enriched uranium 90 uranium 235 isotope produce huge factory oak ridge tennessee
plutonium produce huge factory hanford washington
bomb mechanism develop build huge lab los alamos new mexico leadership j. robert oppenheimer project scientific director
atomic bombs grove oppenheimer leadership
immense project overcome difficulty year produce atomic bomb
live test july 16 1945 produce explosion equivalent 20,000 ton explosive
uranium 235 bomb plutonium bomb drop japanese city hiroshima nagasaki practically level kill population blast heat radiation radiation pollution continue kill people year later
response shocked japanese leadership surrender world war 2 finally end
insight manhattan project japan defeat continued conventional war undoubtedly cost life million japanese civilian life save atomic bomb end war
post war decade world witness massive nuclear arm race grave danger sudden destruction mankind massive nuclear war awareness political military leader mutually assure destruction save mankind
mankind face challenge keep atomic bomb storage reach use war end war
start obscure discovery physics experiment
despite understand military potential warn great danger nazi germany develop bomb step awareness massive action take year potentially fatal delay
racist arrogance nazis hate jews dismiss advanced field science nonsense cost chance win war
