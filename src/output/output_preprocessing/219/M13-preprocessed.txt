mark oliphant biography mark oliphant 1901â€“2000 was considered a great leader in the sciences one who inspired his students by his own show of zeal for his research and his positive view of life in general
he was a physicist who helped develop the atom bomb although he later protested its use and became an ardent humanitarian
in oliphant 's obituary the new york times wrote he pressed for the peaceful use of atomic energy and spoke out against all weapons capable of mass destruction
starting in 1945 he insisted that the world must get rid of war or die and that the use of nuclear arms would be a moral crime using nuclear weapons he said was a dirty rotten way to kill people that could not be justified in any circumstances even in retaliation born and raised in australia oliphant was born markus laurence elwin oliphant on october 8 1901 in adelaide australia
he was the oldest of five sons
oliphant 's father was a very religious man and he wanted his oldest son to be a priest but oliphant had always been more interested in gadgets and science than in religion
oliphant was quoted on the australia biography website as saying i was always fooling about in the shed at the back of the garden with bits of wire and bits of wood making what my brothers called my raggedy baggedy engines
 still he was highly influenced by religion as a young man and he always held a healthy respect for it
as he grew up he also held an appreciation for education partly instilled by his mother who was a schoolteacher
he graduated from high school with good grades before he went on to attend the university of adelaide
he was originally interested in dentistry or medicine but a teacher of his dr. roy burdon saw an aptitude for physics in the young man and persuaded him to switch his major
after a short while oliphant agreed and he graduated with a degree in physics
to pay for his education he took any odd job he could find working his way through university
after graduation he got a job cleaning floors for a jewelry manufacturer
he married rosa wilbraham who was also from adelaide in 1925 and the two had one daughter
it was while he was working at the jewelers in 1925 that oliphant attended a lecture given by new zealand physicist ernest rutherford
he was so impressed by what rutherford had to say that he immediately decided that if he could possibly bring it about he would work for rutherford one day
rutherford worked at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge england one of the most advanced research facilities in nuclear power at that time
in 1927 oliphant won an exhibition prize at adelaide university and then was accepted to cambridge university
he took a job as exhibition scholar at the cavendish laboratory fulfilling his wish
he worked there under rutherford with a team of scientists whose task was to find a way to split an atom
team first to split the atom oliphant and the team he worked with managed to split the first atom in 1932
it was an amazing accomplishment but did not take up all of oliphant 's time
besides his work on splitting the atom oliphant concentrated on artificially disintegrating the nucleus and positive ions of the atom as well as designing a particle accelerator
while doing these things oliphant himself discovered helium 3 and tritium and also figured out that the nuclei of heavy hydrogen could be forced to react with one another and to fuse together
it was this discovery of fusion that led the way to the hydrogen bomb although oliphant never wanted nor intended the knowledge to be used in such a way
it was american scientist edward teller who used oliphant 's knowledge to build the atom bomb
in 1937 oliphant took a position with the university of birmingham where he became a professor of physics
while at the university along with john randall and harry boot he continued his research and in 1939 he received a grant to help develop a short wavelength radar
it was this radar that helped the fight against the german u boats and bomber offensives during world war ii former wavelengths had been around 150 centimeters very widely spread out but these new ones were only 10 centimeters which meant that the radar waves could be focused in narrow beams on one specific point to find ships submarines and aircraft as well as cities
it was a world changing discovery
that was the same year that oliphant took a trip to visit berkeley california
he there met ernest lawrence who taught oliphant how to build a 60 inch cyclotron
because of the advent of world war ii he was unable to finish the project until 1950
world war ii brought about atom bomb in 1940
two men otto frisch and rudolf peierls who also worked at the university of birmingham theorized that uranium-235 could be used to create an atom bomb
oliphant was charged with taking their ideas to a committee which had the code name of maud
maud in turn sent the theory to the united states and its uranium committee in march of 1941 but the united states seemed to be uninterested in the idea as they made no reply to the report
britain however entrenched in war with germany thought the bomb was necessary and important to their efforts
oliphant was sent to america where he arranged to meet with the uranium committee
he stressed the importance of the project and urged that the committee begin implementing a plan to develop an atomic weapon
after speaking to the committee he went to visit his friends and fellow scientists ernest lawrence james conant and enrico fermi
he stressed to them the importance of the project looking to them to back him up
because of his efforts the united states established the office of scientific research and development
this office took on the uranium committee as one of its projects and in december of 1941 after pearl harbor was attacked by the japanese they set up the manhattan engineering district to house what would soon be called the manhattan project to research the building of a uranium atom bomb
oliphant appalled by bomb 's power oliphant moved to america in november of 1943 to work on the manhattan project sent as a british delegate
after the use of the bomb in 1945 on hiroshima and nagasaki japan however he was appalled by the devastation and argued against its ever being used again
he especially argued against an american monopoly on nuclear technology
time international wrote oliphant made key contributions to the understanding of nuclear disintegration and the design of particle accelerators

we had no idea he later said that this would one day be applied to make hydrogen bombs
 although he had been sent to press america to build a bomb no one at the time knew how devastating such a bomb would be and oliphant has said he would not have pressed for its creation if he had known
he did little work on the actual bomb however because the idea of it made him anxious
instead he spent most of his time at berkeley with lawrence trying to refine uranium 235
it was an important project if less militarily focused
for his work with this he was awarded the hughes medal in 1943
in april of 1945 oliphant returned to england
after ve day he returned to the university of birmingham to continue on as professor of physics
it was while he was there that he first heard how the atom bomb was used and exactly how powerful it was
he felt justifiably divided about the report
on the one hand he felt a scientist 's excitement that an idea he had helped create had worked but on the other hand the stronger side he had a humane abhorrence at what the bomb had cost in human lives
like so many of the scientists who had worked on the project oliphant had never expected that the bomb 's effects would be so devastating
from this point on oliphant became an extreme critic of nuclear weapons
he joined the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs to discuss with people all over the world the idea that no one should ever use such a weapon again
the economist wrote like many of the scientists who helped to make the atomic bomb mark oliphant expressed dismay when it was used to destroy hiroshima and nagasaki
during the cold war years he was labeled a peacenik the contemptuous term used to describe those who questioned the morality of using nuclear weapons returned to australia and knighted because of his anti nuclear weapons stance oliphant was often left out of scientific experiments involving nuclear power
the u.s. government refused to give oliphant a visa in 1951 when he wanted to attend a nuclear physics conference in chicago
the british neglected to ask oliphant for help when they tested 12 nuclear weapons from 1952 to 1957 even though he was exceptionally qualified to assess the safety of the tests to make certain no one was hurt by them
but oliphant never again changed his opinion on the weapons
because of the work he did during the war oliphant was given a congressional medal of freedom with gold palm but the australian government vetoed the honor
oliphant returned to australia in 1950
there he became the first director of the research school of physical sciences at the new australian national university in canberra
while there he helped design and build the world 's largest homopolar generator which was used to give power to a large scientific railgun instrument
he also set up the australian academy of science in 1954 and became its first president in 1956
in 1959 oliphant was knighted
became state governor of south australia he retired from the australian national university in 1967
he was then invited to become the state governor of south australia
he accepted the honor and held office from 1971 to 1976
as governor he used his position to oppose france 's nuclear testing in the pacific
he went so far in fact that he said he would join anyone putting together an expedition to try to stop them
in 1977 he was made a companion in the order of australia
oliphant 's wife rosa died in 1987
after witnessing her suffering prior to her death he became a strong proponent for voluntary euthanasia for debilitating and incurable diseases
oliphant died in canberra on july 14 2000 at the age of 98
oliphant will not soon be forgotten however
many locations have been named after the great scientist including the mark oliphant conservation park the oliphant building at australian national university the oliphant wing of the physics building at the university of adelaide and the mark oliphant building in bedford park south australia
a south australian high school science competition was also named in his honor
he will be remembered as the scientist who unwillingly helped to build the atomic bomb but who stuck by his principles in trying to stop the further development and use of nuclear weapons
