community and historical society discuss eighth episode of wgn 's manhattan september 14th
the second coming"there was a great turnout for the los alamos historical society 's viewing of the eighth episode of wgn 's new series manhattan a fictionalized look at life in los alamos during the manhattan project
a special thanks to ruth lier who brought her girl scout uniform from 1941 to share with us
every week the society updates a bulletin board in the museum to continue exploring questions and reactions as the 13 episode series continues
previous episodes are discussed on this website and on our facebook page
los alamos community members and friends joined the los alamos historical society sundays at time out pizzeria in los alamos from 8–9:30 for a viewing and discussion of manhattan tv-14 rating
did british scientists come to los alamos to work on the project
british scientists did come to los alamos to work on the manhattan project
this group of scientists was commonly known as the british mission

the scientists were in fact part of the a team of scientists who had been working on the idea of implosion in europe
prior to british scientists coming to america to work on the manhattan project the quebec agreement was written and signed by roosevelt and churchill in august 1943
this agreement included the decisions that the bomb project would be a completely joint effort and neither country would use the bomb against the other
professor james chadwick was the senior technical adviser to the british mission
the british team assembled at los alamos eventually numbered 19
among these were otto robert frisch and james tuck
the expertise the british mission provided to the manhattan project was invaluable and essential to the success of the project

did security follow residents coming from the hill army intelligence known as g-2 did follow and keep an eye on residents coming from los alamos
it is unlikely that they followed people on the train as they followed abby in this episode as it did not stop in santa fe at the time
the g-2 agents often stood out due to their matching three piece suits hats and positions on street corners looking nonchalantly at those around them
why was n't thin man built thin man the gun type plutonium bomb was n't built for the reasons charlie discovered in the episode
however these facts were discovered experimentally not predicted theoretically as charlie did
emilio segrè and his group discovered in april 1944 that reactor produced plutonium had larger amounts of pu-240 than cyclotron produced plutonium
isotopes with an even mass number are less likely to absorb neutrons and pu-240 is more than 10,000 times more likely to undergo spontaneous fission than pu-239
this meant that a gun type bomb made with reactor plutonium was much more likely to predetonate as soon as the bullet of plutonium hit the plutonium target unless it were made impractically long to increase the acceleration of the bullet
 where was british implosion research
the british mission did not arrive with a suitcase of research proving that an implosion bomb would not work
much earlier in 1942 james chadwick wondered if any design of plutonium bomb would fail because of isotope impurities
us scientists then investigated this and determined that it was possible to obtain sufficiently pure plutonium
did an implosion bomb seem impossible
the implosion bomb was treated as a back up design until it was found that thin man would predetonate and the physics and engineering of an implosion bomb did seem more daunting in many ways than thin man 's
however even when it was a back up design research on the implosion bomb continued without interruption with important contributions from seth neddermeyer george kistiakowsky john von neumann james tuck robert christy and others
what happened at the city of minsk
abby 's realization of the horrifying events happening in europe during world war ii center around a city named minsk
minsk was a part of the ussr during world war ii with a population of 270,000
in 1941 it was bombed and as much as 85 of the city 's building and infrastructure was destroyed
more than 1,000 people were killed and the germans took over the city
minsk was the site of one of the largest nazi run ghettos during world war ii which held over 100,000 jews
tens of thousands of jews were killed at minsk from 1941 1942
allies knew about the holocaust generally since early on inthe war
notables 
helen mentioned schrödinger 's cat a well known now and in 1943 part of erwin schrödinger 's popular explanation of the weirdness of quantum mechanics
to illustrate how particles are understood to be in multiple states at once before being observed he imagined a cat placed in a box with poison to be released at a random time the cat was both alive and dead simultaneously until someone opened the box and observed it 
the poem that akley quoted in the imagined conversation was william butler yeats second coming
 glen was quoting virginia woolf to liza a woman must have money and a room of her own
