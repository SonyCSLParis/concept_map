rudolf ernst peierls born 5 june 1907 in berlin germany died 19 september 1995 in oakenholt near oxford england rudolf peierls parents were heinrich peierls and elizabeth weigert and he was their only child
the family were ethnically jewish but did not practice the jewish religion
heinrich peierls was director of the berlin oberschöneweide factory of allgemeine elektrizitätsgesellschaft when rudolf was born and the following year he became a member of the board
when rudolf was fourteen years old his mother died of hodgkin 's disease and his father married else hermann who was not jewish soon after
sabine lee writes 6]:-from a young age rudolf was interested in science and engineering
he was a bright child who found school work easy and was keen to probe further into areas that interested him most the sciences
his childhood friends remember many an occasion when he would leave their play in order to think only to return once he had solved whatever problem puzzled him at the time
peierls wanted to follow a career in engineering but his father doubted that his son had the necessary dexterity and practical skills to excel in this so he put pressure on rudolf to enrol in physics courses
he reluctantly took his father 's advice and matriculated at berlin university in 1925 to study experimental physics
notice that he still wanted to study experimental physics rather than theoretical physics but practical subjects were in such high demand at berlin university that the university authorities prevented students taking them in their first year
peierls was then forced to go down the route he had been trying to avoid and take courses in mathematics and theoretical physics
the standard way that students in germany at this time undertook their studies was to move between different universities
after a year at berlin peierls moved to the department of theoretical physics in munich university in 1926
for two years he studied at munich where he was particularly influenced by the teaching of arnold sommerfeld
it was sommerfeld who introduced peierls to quantum mechanics during these two years and this proved highly significant for peierls career
it was during this time that he gained a high level of mathematical expertise following sommerfeld 's philosophy if you want to be a physicist you must do three things first study mathematics second study more mathematics and third do the same
 peierls next move was to the theoretical physics department of leipzig university in 1928 mainly as a result of sommerfeld leaving munich for a world tour
he chose leipzig because werner heisenberg had been appointed as professor there in 1927
he followed heisenberg 's advice of research topic and began the work which would lead to his first paper zur theorie der galvanomagnetischen effekte 1929
in the spring of 1929 heisenberg also went off on a world tour so peierls moved university again this time going to the eidgenössische technische hochschule in zürich to work with wolfgang pauli
he now worked on the thermal conductivity in crystals and by the summer of 1929 had achieved sufficient depth of results that he was able to write two papers and to submit a doctoral dissertation to leipzig university
he was awarded his doctorate from leipzig in 1929 then in the autumn of that year he was appointed as pauli 's assistant in zürich
at zürich peierls worked with lev landau who was visiting zürich
in the summer of 1930 peierls went to a conference in odessa where he met not only with lev landau but also many of his colleagues
one of these colleagues was eugenia nilolaevna kannegisser known as genia
6]:-with their german and russian backgrounds neither of them could converse in the other 's mother tongue and the only common language spoken sufficiently well by both to communicate reasonably comfortably was english
after six months of intense correspondence by letter rudolf peierls travelled to leningrad again in march 1931 and during his brief stay much to the dismay of his surprised family married genia
genia and rudolf married on 15 march 1931 they had three daughters joanna gaby and catherine and one son ronald who became a computational mathematician
peierls was awarded a rockefeller fellowship and he spent the first half of the year 1932 33 in rome with enrico fermi and the second half in england where he worked at cambridge with paul dirac and ralph fowler
he turned down an offer of an assistantship at hamburg despite its high reputation since he saw the problems of rising support for the nazi party
he was glad therefore to accept a position at manchester
he spent a highly productive year there working with hans bethe and began publishing papers on nuclear physics in addition to his continuing work on the electron theory of metals
his next position was a two year fellowship held at cambridge following which in 1937 he accepted a professorship in mathematical physics at birmingham university
the deteriorating political situation in germany led to peierls attempting to gain british citizenship in may 1938 and at the same time he tried to reject his german citizenship
this process took time and when world war ii began the process was still not complete and peierls and his wife were both classified as enemy aliens
restrictions were lifted in february 1940 when his application for british citizenship was approved
however undertaking war work was still difficult and this would prove particularly so when together with otto frisch an austrian he made it known to the british government through the 3 page frisch peierls memorandum that he had the theoretical knowledge to make an atomic bomb from uranium-235 a possibility
the government set up the maud committee to examine the frisch peierls memorandum and at first because of peierls and frisch 's german and austrian backgrounds they were prevented from taking part
soon however the realisation that it was impossible to prevent the two scientists who had proposed the idea from knowing about it came home to the committee and peierls and frisch were invited as members of a technical subcommittee
early in 1941 peierls invited klaus fuchs to join him otto frisch and james chadwick in the work on the theoretical side of the british project to develop an atomic bomb
in august 1943 the quebec conference set up a formal collaboration between britain and the united states on nuclear weapons research and after a fact finding mission by peierls in washington all the key british researchers joined the manhattan project
peierls worked first in new york then at los alamos until the end of world war ii when he returned to birmingham
he continued to work there despite offers from oxford manchester london and cambridge
during these years he also worked as a consultant to the british atomic programme at harwell where klaus fuchs who had worked closely with him on the atomic bomb project now held a senior position
when fuchs was exposed as a russian spy in 1950 it caused considerable embarrassment to peierls who had to endure press speculation that he was also a spy
the spectator alleged he spied for the soviet union with the codename perls but this was totally unfounded 6]:-his contacts with left wing colleagues his friendship with people of communist persuasion his marriage to a russian his close friendship with klaus fuchs all led to his being viewed with a degree of suspicion by many
his applications for a visa to visit the united states met with long delays
in 1957 the americans asked the british to revoke his security clearance which they did
as a result peierls resigned from his consultancy role at harwell
in 1961 he was offered the wykeham chair of physics at oxford
by now he was feeling that he had been in birmingham long enough and was looking for a challenge
however he did not rush to accept which he did not do until the following year only taking up the position in 1963
he worked in oxford until he retired in 1974 then spent the period between february and may of each of the next three years at the university of washington
the list of other places he visited in the years following his retirement is too long to give here
peierls received many honours such as election to the royal society in 1945 and receiving their royal medal in 1959
he was also awarded the max planck medal 1963 the enrico fermi award 1980 the matteucci medal 1982 and the copley medal 1986
for his wartime contributions he was made a commander of the british empire in 1946 but the most pleasing honour of all was a knighthood in 1968 since it gave him an acceptance by the british establishment after many years of unfair suspicion
in 1997 two years after his death selected scientific papers of sir rudolf peierls was published
h s green writes in a review:-sir rudolf peierls was probably the most influential of the german mathematical physicists who migrated and settled in britain during the nazi era
an inveterate traveller he was well acquainted with nearly all the distinguished mathematical and theoretical physicists of his time and worked with many of them he also had many young friends and research students who achieved distinction 
this valuable book features a selection of 72 of the much larger number of scientific papers and lectures that peierls contributed to the scientific literature and includes translations into english of his early work as well as personal comments by the author which modestly evaluate the importance of most of the papers 
peierls was a highly competent though not a notably creative mathematician his principal interest was clearly in making calculations which would lead to a deep understanding of physical phenomena and he was adept at finding approximations which gave trustworthy numerical results
his more mathematically elegant papers such as one with dirac and pryce were in collaboration with people with more mathematical inclinations
however it is remarkable how many of these papers have played a crucial role for the subsequent development of their subjects
we end this biography by looking briefly at his two books surprises in theoretical physics 1979 and more surprises in theoretical physics 1991
describing the first p roman writes:-this unusual fascinating slim volume renders exactly what its distinguished author promises to illustrate and to entertain"---and to delight the reader i would like to add
it is based on obviously leisurely lectures that sir rudolf gave in 1977/78 both in the u.s. and in france
it presents a number of examples in which a plausible explanation is not borne out by a more careful analysis
thus the book is didactic and it challenges the reader 's intellect
the topics covered are mostly from quantum theory and its applications statistical physics and even relativity are touched upon 
the book should be not only a bedside companion for mature scientists but also a challenging easily followed and highly appreciated supplementary text for graduate students in theoretical physics in europe also for advanced undergraduates
the second text was reviewed by a ventura who writes:-surprises in theoretical physics are either theoretical results in disagreement with naïve physical intuition or simple solutions to apparently unmanageable problems
a first collection of surprises was published in 1979 and is now supplemented by the present work with topics taken mainly from the long multifaceted experience of the author 
this book can be warmly recommended to physics students and to their teachers as a valid auxiliary tool for courses in quantum mechanics structure of matter and statistical physics
another two significant books were the laws of nature 1955 and his autobiography bird of passage 1985
