it 's almost 70 years since america ushered in the atomic age and as the threat of nuclear weapons remains the remnants of the manhattan project are still visible across the united states
photographer martin miller traveled to two nuclear explosives production facilities constructed during the infamous mission to build the world 's first atomic bomb a uranium production plant in oak ridge tennessee and a full scale plutonium protection reactor in hanford washington
his incredible photographs document the stark now abandoned sites where between 1939 and 1945 america 's top scientists developed the gadget as it was code named throughout its development and explosives used in the nuclear weapons detonated over hiroshima and nagasaki japan
explosive work the b reactor control console which was completed in hanford nuclear reservation washington in 1944 and used to source plutonium for the nagasaki bomb the manhattan project was sparked when albert einstein wrote to then president franklin d. roosevelt informing him that nazi germany was working towards a similar end game
the u.s. government almost immediately expedited research into developing a viable atomic bomb
mr miller said it was difficult to visit the historic sites without experiencing a sense of awe at what was accomplished the scientific engineering managerial labor and logistical challenges that were met and overcome are separately impressive but taken together simply astonishing
but he added that appreciation of the monumental achievements of the manhattan project could not be considered without a pang of regret at what it unleashed into the world engineering feat a modern day photograph shows the outside of the reactor at the hanford nuclear reservation which was completed in 1944b reactor front face source of nagasaki bomb plutonium hanford nuclear reservation wa 1944
after six years of work at 5:29am on july 16 1945 the first atomic bomb was detonated in a white blaze that stretched from the basin of the jemez mountains in northern new mexico to the still dark skies
as the orange fireball shot upwards at 360 feet per second before forming the characteristic mushroom cloud of radioactive vapor at 30,000 feet the u.s. government 's good intentions had given birth to the monstrous reality that still hangs over civilisation
an untested uranium bomb was then dropped on hiroshima while a plutonium bomb was dropped on nagasaki causing the japanese to surrender

these were the astonishing sites where the bombs were developed with two billion dollars years of labour and expert engineering
clinton engineering works in tennessee was the site of several plants that concentrated the rare uranium isotope u235 from the more abundant u238 miller explained
machines known as calutrons completed electromagnetic separation and the u235 was later used in the hiroshima bomb
the advanced processes were carried out at the u shaped building which measured nearly a mile around and enclosed hundreds of miles of piping making it the largest building in the world at the time of its construction
it was followed by five more buildings over the next decade

throughout the cold war six more reactors were built yet all are now deactivated
hanford is now striving to minimize the future consequences of the plutonium production but it is impossible to restore the land to its former state
after the uranium and plutonium was gathered it was used in the bomb assemly in los alamos new mexico
