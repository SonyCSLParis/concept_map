the manhattan project world war ii started on september 1 1939 when germany attacked poland
by 1941 the germans were ahead in the race for the atomic bomb
they had a heavy water plant high grade uranium compounds capable scientists and engineers and the greatest chemical engineering industry in the world
even before its entry into the war the united states had become very concerned with the nuclear threat of the axis powers
on october 11 1939 president franklin d. roosevelt received a letter from albert einstein which einstein had actually written on august 2 1939
the letter told of a new field of physics that was showing that the element uranium could undergo nuclear fission with the resultant release of a great deal of energy
einstein described the probability that a sustained nuclear reaction could be produced and the possibility of the construction of extremely powerful bombs
he described the possibility that such bombs could be delivered by ship although he was skeptical that such weapons could be delivered by air
he noted the likelihood that germany would pursue the same line of research and that the germans had already suspended the export of uranium from the czech mines in their newly acquired territory
roosevelt took the warning seriously and within a month had organized a research committee
the united states introduced its own nuclear program under the army corps of engineers in june 1942
the u.s. needed to build an atomic weapon before germany or japan did
on may 12 1942 president roosevelt signed an order creating a secret project to develop the nuclear weapon
the program that developed the atomic bomb for the united states during world war ii was the largest secret project ever undertaken by the u.s. government
the project was originally named development of substitute materials but there was concern that the name was too suggestive of its real purpose
since it was frequently the case the us army corps of engineers offices were named for the city in which they were based it was renamed manhattan engineering district which became known as the manhattan project
the corresponding british project known as tube alloys was incorporated
though it eventually included over 30 different research and production sites the manhattan project was chiefly carried out in three secret scientific cities hanford washington oak ridge tennessee and los alamos new mexico
the first atomic bombs were designed and built at a site in los alamos nm which was in a remote location and had existing buildings from its days as a school
known as the hill los alamos produced two bombs one was a gun type weapon and the second used implosion to detonate plutonium
the search for a suitable test site began in may 1944
the site needed to be relatively flat isolated from populated areas and close to los alamos
a section of land near alamogordo in south central new mexico was chosen and code named trinity
on july 16 1945 the world entered the nuclear age with the detonation of the first atomic bomb
the explosion created a crater which measured nearly 2,400 feet across and was equivalent to about 20,000 tons of tnt
the manhattan project produced three bombs the first bomb was known as gadget and was used as a test model
due to the enormous expense and slow production rates for explosive material no further tests were conducted
the second bomb known as little boy was detonated over the city of hiroshima and the final bomb fat man was detonated over the city of nagasaki
nuclear development continued throughout the war
the threat of a german atomic bomb never translated into reality and when the nazis surrendered in may 1945 neither side had produced a working atomic weapon
however pressure to complete the weapon remained very great
an atomic bomb was considered a primary alternative to the dreaded land invasion of the japanese mainland
many scientists who had produced the atomic bombs were against its use and argued to the end that the bomb should not be used for ethical reasons
they also warned of an arms race that would develop at the end of the war
many other scientists however felt that the u.s. was not attacking japan but rather defending itself from a country who attacked the u.s. first
the two bombs were transported to the pacific theater for use against japan
little boy was carried by a b-29 bomber called enola gay and dropped over hiroshima on august 6 1945 resulting in the immediate or delayed deaths of 100,000 people
the government of japan still refused to surrender and on august 9 fat man was released from another b-29 over nagasaki
faced with the prospect of continued annihilation of its cities as well as not knowing that the u.s. had no other atomic bombs ready to deploy japan surrendered unconditionally on august 15 1945
the history of the manhattan project remained classified for many years
in fact it was so secret that harry s. truman although vice president of the united states was not made aware of its existence until after the death of roosevelt in 1945
the manhattan project allowed the united states to unlock the mysteries of the atom but it also introduced the most destructive creation of warfare known to mankind
the project became a forerunner in nuclear development and control and signified the beginning of an era of nuclear weapons and scientific discovery
