britain 's nuclear weapons from maud to hurricane we have made a successful start
when the nuclear tests are completed as they soon will be we shall be in the same position as the united states or soviet russia
we shall have made and tested the massive weapons
it will be possible then to discuss on equal terms
u.k. prime minister harold macmillan 1957 last changed 4 july 2007 britain was the first country to seriously study the feasibility of nuclear weapons and made a number of critical conceptual breakthroughs
the first theoretically sound critical mass calculation was made in england by otto frisch and rudolf peierls in feb. 1940
inspired by this finding the maud committee a code name chosen from the first name of one member 's nanny was founded
headed by sir henry tizard from 10 april 1940 to 15 july 1941 this committee worked out the basic principles of both fission bomb design and uranium enrichment by gaseous diffusion
the work done by the maud committee was instrumental in alerting the u.s. and through espionage the ussr to the feasibility of fission weapons in wwii
a high level of cooperation between britain the u.s. and canada continued through the war formalized by the 1943 quebec agreement
britain sent the british mission a team of first rank scientists to work at los alamos
among the scientists who made this journey were the pioneer of shock wave physics geoffrey i. taylor and a protege william g. penney
the mission made major contributions to the manhattan project and provided the nucleus for british post war atomic weapons development effort
immediately after world war ii on 29 august 1945 the new labor government headed by prime minister clement attlee convened a organized a secret cabinet committee on atomic energy to establish nuclear policy
this committee called gen.75 was a subset of the full cabinet and was termed the atom bomb committee by attlee
later on an even smaller secret group of ministers known as gen.163 which was a subset of gen.75 made key decisions relating to the atomic bomb program
an advisory group called the advisory committee on atomic energy acae was also set up and on 18 december 1945 pm attlee reconvened gen.75 to consider this group 's report
the initial step of building one or more nuclear reactors was adopted
attlee appointed a team of three senior leaders of the british atomic energy program in late january 1946
to direct the british effort in atomic energy lord portal air marshal viscount portal of hungerford was made controller of production atomic energy cpae after 1950 controller atomic energy or cae
physicist sir john crockcroft was named director of the atomic energy research establishment aere and christopher hinton a senior ici engineer became the leader of the fissile material production program
lord portal can be thought of as the british leslie groves who directed the manhattan project in the u.s. one key difference here was the existence of a civilian oriented program absent during the war
the two civilian oriented components of the british atomic energy program but with deliberate military applications were led by crockcroft and hinton were under portal
the third secret part of the program the development of atomic weapons came a bit later
the initial sites for britain 's nuclear program were also elected in 1946
the two civilian oriented components were located at harwell on the berkshire downs 12 miles south of oxford for the aere research center and risley in lancashire for hinton 's industrial complex
construction began there for britain 's first nuclear reactor bepo britain experimental pile zero which went critical on 3 july 1948

penney 's area of specialty was studying the physics of hydrodynamic waves both shock waves and the more familiar ocean gravity waves
penney had designed and supervised development of the mobile breakwaters used to protect the landing sites of the normandy d day invasion in 1944
shortly before d day he had left his teaching post at imperial college in london and travelled to los alamos at the request of g. i. taylor
at los alamos penney 's principal assignment was studying the damage effects from the blast wave of the atomic bomb but he became involved in implosion studies as well and spent up to half his time working in this area
his expertise in ocean waves was also called upon to investigate the effects of underwater explosions
penney 's combination of expertise analytical skill effective communication and the ability to translate them into practical application soon made him one of the five members of the los alamos brain trust that made key decisions in the direction of the program putting him in the company of robert oppenheimer john von neumann deke parsons and norman ramsey
on 27 april 1945 penney became one of only two representatives from los alamos and the only briton to be part of the ten man target committee that drew up the list of targets for the atomic bombing of japan
penney travelled to tinian island in the pacific to be on hand for planning and briefing the atomic bombing missions
penney actually witnessed the bombing of nagasaki flying in an observation plane accompanying the attack
afterward he conducted damage surveys there on the ground
penney returned to imperial college immediately after the war but soon received other offers
he turned down the prestigious sedleian chair of mathematics at oxford university and accepted an offer tendered to him by c.p. snow the position of chief superintendent of armament research csar called caesar which placed him in charge of the armament research department ard
penney 's appointment was announced 1 january 1946
no decision had been made by the british government at that point to develop an atomic bomb but clearly penney realized that this decision was inevitable and when it happened the responsibility would fall to him to lead the effort
penney was soon called away from his post in london at the request of general groves to participate in the first post war nuclear test called operation crossroads
the u.s. had turned sharply away from collaborating on nuclear technology with the uk after the end of the war and this was a golden opportunity for britain to keep this relationship alive operation crossroads was conducted at bikini atoll by 242 ships and 42,000 men and tested the effect of two atomic bombs on a captive test fleet of warships
on 1 october 1946 penney returned to london and at the request of lord portal spent the month writing a ten page report outlining a plan for developing an atomic bomb
penney met with portal to discuss the plan on 4 november
penney then returned to preparing a final report on the crossroads tests and travelled to washington dc in december to present his findings returning to london in february
on 8 january 1947 the secret gen.163 cabinet committee of six ministers headed by pm attlee decided to proceed with development and acquisition of atomic weapons
curiously penney did not receive word of this decision until may 1947 when he was finally asked by portal to lead britain 's own nuclear weapon program
the decision was not disclosed publicly in any respect until 12 may 1948 when an oblique reference was made to atomic weapon development in parliamentary discussions
in june 1947 penney began assembling a team to work on the bomb
one of his first steps was to prepare a document describing the design of the u.s. implosion bomb in detail and breaking down the development tasks required to replicate it and identifying outstanding questions that required further research
this report was completed on 1 july and gave the british atomic weapons program a starting design description roughly equivalent in terms of detail to the description provided the soviets by klaus fuchs
penney 's plan entitled plutonium weapon general description is available on this website
it is complete with penney 's written report and his diagrams of the planned weapon
the project was code named basic high explosive research or bher later just her and was based at woolwich arsenal
unlike the u.s. atomic bomb project which had been centrally located at the custom built facility of los alamos bher drew on existing groups scattered over several sites
in addition to woolwich ard groups at fort halstead and other sites were involved
furthermore not all aspects of bomb development resided with bher
although bher was responsible for the overall weapon design and the development and fabrication of the implosion system the manufacture of the plutonium core initially resided with the plutonium production program under hinton
this created problems in organization since lines of authority with other research sites were often not clear
by mid 1948 the responsibilities had been settled and on 1 april 1950 a single site was selected for atomic weapons development at aldermaston in berkshire
a site for the first plutonium production reactors and plutonium processing plant was selected at sellafield on the irish sea coast in cumberland
the site was renamed windscale now sellafield again and construction began in september 1947
in october 1950 the first production reactor went critical
the plutonium plant began operation on 25 february 1952 and produced the first plutonium metal 35 days later
a gaseous diffusion plant was also planned and the site eventually chosen in early 1950 was capenhurst near chester
this plant finally began operation in 1953
an extension boosted its annual production capacity to 125 kg of heu at the end of 1957
10 klarger size 30 kmonte bello islands australia also see this map due to the small size and high population density of britain no suitable sites for atmospheric weapons tests existed
britain thus sought sites in other countries to test its weapons finally settling on the monte bello islands just off the west coast of australia
the plutonium for the first test device was needed by 1 august 1952 to meet the schedule
because the windscale plant was not quite able to meet this some canadian supplied plutonium was also incorporated into the core
15 september 1952 the plutonium core for the first british nuclear device code named hurricane left england
the expedition to test the first british atomic bomb was led by captain later rear admiral ad torlesse sailing on his flag ship the escort carrier hms campania
the entire expedition fleet consisted of five ships the campania the sacrificial test ship plym and three landing craft and 1500 men a fraction of the size of the crossroads operation
this force proved to be just barely adequate to carry out the planned test operation finding itself stretched to the limit in almost every capacity

hurricane was detonated in a lagoon off the western shore of trimouille island
the bomb was exploded inside the hull of the river class frigate hms plym which was anchored in 12 m 40 feet of water 400 yards off shore
the explosion occurred 2.7 m below the water line
there seems to be some discrepancy in the precise time of the test
the time normally given is 0000z
mignight zulu time that is gmt or 0001z
on 3 october 1952 arnold 1987 arnold explains that the shot was almost precisely at midnight and that 0001z was used to assign it to a definite gmt date
according to cathcart 1994
however the test was 36 seconds before the hour
cathcart adds some possible confusion about what the hour was also
he gives the test time as 36 seconds before 8 am perth time normally 8 hours later then gmt but 1 am london time which is normally gmt
this was the first british nuclear test
the device tested was a plutonium implosion bomb similar to the fat man but improved by using a levitated pit
the bomb used plutonium produced at windscale now sellafield with a low pu-240 content since hurried production led to short irradiation times
in fact windscale could not quite meet the august 1 deadline for manufacturing the core and the device also used some canadian supplied plutonium
the test was devised to investigate the effects of a ship smuggled bomb a threat of great concern to the british at the time
the ship was mostly vaporized by the explosion except for scattered fragments of hot metal that set fires to the spinifex scrub covering trimouille
the explosion occured 2.7 m below the water line and left a saucer shaped crater on the seabed 20 feet deep and 1,000 feet across
the cloud from the explosion rose only to 15,000 feet due to the very dry air which allowed evaporation of water to cool the ascending cloud and the presence of a strong inversion at that altitude
except for the men stationed at the control center on hermite island everyone observed the test from the campania which had put to sea
by a strange coincidence the principal observation site for the first u.s. nuclear test was a hill named compania
