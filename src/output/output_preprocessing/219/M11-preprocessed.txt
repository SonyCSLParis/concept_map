immediately world war ii 29 august 1945 new labor government head prime minister clement attlee convene organize secret cabinet committee atomic energy establish nuclear policy
committee call gen.75 subset cabinet term atom bomb committee attlee
later small secret group minister know gen.163 subset gen.75 key decision relate atomic bomb program
advisory group call advisory committee atomic energy acae set 18 december 1945 pm attlee reconvene gen.75 consider group report
initial step build nuclear reactor adopt
attlee appoint team senior leader british atomic energy program late january 1946
direct british effort atomic energy lord portal air marshal viscount portal hungerford controller production atomic energy cpae 1950 controller atomic energy cae
physicist sir john crockcroft name director atomic energy research establishment aere christopher hinton senior ici engineer leader fissile material production program
lord portal think british leslie groves direct manhattan project u.s. key difference existence civilian orient program absent war
civilian orient component british atomic energy program deliberate military application lead crockcroft hinton portal
secret program development atomic weapon come bit later
initial site britain nuclear program elect 1946

penney appointment announce 1 january 1946
decision british government point develop atomic bomb clearly penney realize decision inevitable happen responsibility fall lead effort
penney soon call away post london request general groves participate post war nuclear test call operation crossroads
u.s. turn sharply away collaborate nuclear technology uk end war golden opportunity britain relationship alive

1 october 1946 penney return london request lord portal spend month write page report outline plan develop atomic bomb
penney meet portal discuss plan 4 november
penney return prepare final report crossroads test travel washington dc december present finding return london february
8 january 1947 secret gen.163 cabinet committee ministers head pm attlee decide proceed development acquisition atomic weapon
curiously penney receive word decision 1947 finally ask portal lead britain nuclear weapon program
decision disclose publicly respect 12 1948 oblique reference atomic weapon development parliamentary discussion
june 1947 penney begin assemble team work bomb
step prepare document describe design u.s. implosion bomb detail break development task require replicate identify outstanding question require research
report complete 1 july give british atomic weapon program start design description roughly equivalent term detail description provide soviets klaus fuchs
penney plan entitle plutonium weapon general description available website
complete penney write report diagram planned weapon
project code name basic high explosive research bher later base woolwich arsenal
unlike u.s. atomic bomb project centrally locate custom build facility los alamos bher draw exist group scatter site
addition woolwich ard group fort halstead site involve
furthermore aspect bomb development reside bher
bher responsible overall weapon design development fabrication implosion system manufacture plutonium core initially reside plutonium production program hinton
create problem organization line authority research site clear
mid 1948 responsibility settle 1 april 1950 single site select atomic weapon development aldermaston berkshire
site plutonium production reactor plutonium processing plant select sellafield irish sea coast cumberland
site rename windscale sellafield construction begin september 1947
october 1950 production reactor go critical
plutonium plant begin operation 25 february 1952 produce plutonium metal 35 day later
gaseous diffusion plant plan site eventually choose early 1950 capenhurst near chester
plant finally begin operation 1953
