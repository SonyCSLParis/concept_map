british instrumental prod action maud report canadians uranium

question late 1942 program undergo massive transformation
prior 1942 american effort primarily research program try answer question atomic bomb build reasonable time
late 1942 onward effort shift production program effort try produce actual bomb use war
british let later phase united states need british
think james b. conant president harvard chairman national defense research committee1 close friend vannevar bush director office scientific research development civilian manhattan project
week document letter conant bush december 1942 outline reason think essentially abandon british point work:2conant implore bush clarify matter uk participation scale bomb project run u.s. army corps engineers get way clearly difficult continue complete scientific interchange hand restrict development interchange arrangement carefully spell line research development nebulous people involve
conant decision completely pragmatically
presumably reason share secret military information allied nation prosecution war engage
question share information british
think
british produce fissile material example pass knowledge subject assist british way present war effort
scheme british participate part work actually close make atomic bomb world war ii

practice british nearly completely keep hanford james chadwick visit learn plutonium work los alamos
canadians found lab montreal chalk river exclude american information general groves
conant eventually embrace quebec agreement
initial reason want british difficulty control secrecy prove exactly correct
klaus fuchs member british delegation los alamos prove significant wartime atomic spy
course wrong british contribute british delegation include fuchs major contribution practical realization bomb los alamos
maybe even
