the terror of gothic castles how gothic novels and gothic architecture created truly spooky places gothic castles have occupied a place in people 's imaginations for hundreds of years
however there 's some confusion about what the word actually means

gothic is an amalgamation of two different ideas from different times in history
originally gothic referred to a style of architecture that was popular in the middle of medieval times mid middle ages
it was a style of architecture which was famed for grand arched buildings with sweeping windows
many cathedrals in europe are gothic and malbork castle is an example of gothic architecture
in the 1700s gothic acquired a new meaning
there was a trend for a new genre of writing gothic novels
these were a precursor for the horror stories of today
gothic novels were written to develop feelings of fear and terror in a reader and were set in evocative crumbling old castles abbeys and manors
hunyad castle is an example of a spooky gothic castle
nowadays when people talk of gothic castles they 're usually meaning a mix of these two ideas
gothic is taken to mean an architectural style as well as an atmosphere of spooky fearful desolate and ruined old places

gothic castle architecture sweeping designs for mid medieval times
before gothic architecture came along castles of early medieval times were cold dark and damp
building technology was rudimentary which meant that most castles were encumbered with tiny windows and leaky roofs
worse still the castles were often liable to attack square towers could easily be toppled when attackers burrowed beneath just one of the corners
gothic architecture was a mid medieval movement that revolutionised the way that buildings were built
there are seven key characteristics of gothic architecture and these include taller more ornate towers propped by flying buttresses
a new technological development the flying buttress meant that it was possible to build taller wider and grander buildings
the flying buttress took the strain of the thicker walls and made ambitious designs possible
these flying buttresses are a feature of gothic architecture

the ceilings in gothic buildings were made of up grand pointed arches which created an interesting vaulted effect
these vaults often gave the impression of height and majesty
they contrasted dramatically to the short and dark towers of older castles
grandiose pointed arches
improvements in building skill and the manipulation of stone meant that gothic styles could be more beautiful and elaborate than previous designs
taller rooms with lots of light and fresh air
these was made possible by the developments above and ushered in a new age of design which was dramatically different from the claustrophobic old castles of before
i 've written another page on the characteristics of gothic architecture if you 're keen to find out more
the gothic architecture movement originated in france and spread across europe
it was reasonably influential in england and wales but gothic architecture really flourished within eastern europe
the dungeons of chillon castle are a perfect example of the gothic
the vaulted arches are typical of gothic architecture and the spooky surroundings have been featured in gothic novels and poetry
credit ioan sameli cc by-2.0this new architectural style was most readily adopted by new cathedrals churches and abbeys
however some castles began to be built in the gothic fashion malbork castle in poland being the most obvious example
evidently these light airy and sophisticated gothic designs were a vast step up from the dark dank old stone castles of yore
fundamentally gothic architecture really marked a renaissance in castle design
it transformed castles from being fortresses with unpleasant living quarters to majestic and impressive buildings with beautiful residential apartments for the lord and his family
gothic design also marked an improvement in terms of castle defence
the skills to build more complex and sophisticated buildings such as round towers made castles harder to attack
round towers had no corners for attackers to burrow beneath and topple the castle
castles as a place of fear and terror gothic castles and the gothic novel dark secret passageways are a common feature of gothic novels

back in 1764 something spooky was brewing in english literature
novelist horace walpole had written a new type of book altogether creating a new genre of fiction
his novel was called the castle of oranto and it made a splash as the first gothic novel
gothic novels were written to elicit strong emotions they set out to intrigue and to terrify readers in equal measure
the novels were written to conjure up images of mysterious decaying old buildings where dark secrets had laid hidden for hundreds of years
often these novels were set in the ruins of old castles
gothic writers loved the imagery of an old castle a place of decayed grandeur once full of life and vitality but now seeped in decay
they described castles as being filled with memories of life gone by and marked by death
this meant that castles were often used as a setting in gothic novels
castles played an important role in the gothic novel
after all the very first gothic tale was called the castle of otranto- set in a spooky castle filled with creaking doors dark corners ghostly footsteps and hidden passageways
if you 're a literary buff you might want to read the castle of otranto via amazon.com but do be warned that it 's quite a difficult text for modern audiences
gothic novels featured elements of mystery of romance of ghosts of monsters frankenstein started life as a gothic novel of murders and of vampires such as the figure of dracula
in very little time gothic novels became incredibly popular and formed the foundations of horror novels and horror stories which are so popular today
as a result of the influence of the gothic novel people 's imaginations began to conjure up pictures of gothic castles
the public began to imagine castles to be deserted places of hauntings murders mystery and intrigue
people envisaged castles to be filled with secret passages terrible old mysteries and even to be filled with vampires and fearful creatures see more on hunyad castle just below 
fundamentally gothic fiction created an image of spooky deserted and menacing old castles
this image lives on in people 's minds to today and it 's certainly evoked many powerful emotions over the years

it 's a pretty perfect example of gothic architecture
it boasts a huge threatening bulk with witches hat style turrets studded along its side
parts of the castle exterior are decorated with over ornate gothic detail see the picture just below and the innards are filled with vaulted ceilings over vast echoing halls
the gothic looks of hunyad castle are a little bit too perfect
this castle has been ravaged by fire on numerous occasions and restorations in the 1800s and 1900s over exaggerated the gothic style on the outside of the building
hunyad castle is located in transylvania romania and vlad the impaler iii more commonly known as dracula was allegedly held prisoner here
apparently- the legend goes he was forced to live in a tiny cell beneath the knight 's hall and survived by eating rats
this drove him to understandable madness and subsequent stories of blood sucking fun were inspired by his insanity
although this gothic exterior detail on hunyad castle was probably meant to make it look more inviting it just makes it look even scarier

there 's another dastardly old legend attached to the castle
in the 1500s the old tale goes three prisoners from turkey were promised their freedom if they could dig down far enough in the courtyard to find water
the prisoners dug desperately for fifteen years until finally they found water
terribly the legend goes they it captors turned on their word
the prisoners were never freed despite toiling to build the old castle well
nowadays tourists toss coins into the well to grant a wish- and to reward the work of the old prisoners
