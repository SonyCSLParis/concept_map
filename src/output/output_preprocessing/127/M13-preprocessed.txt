tower house castles of medieval europe tower of hallbar south lanarkshire scotland
photo by user supergolden from wikimedia commons castles in europe have gone through several stages of evolution
the tower house is one type of castle built during the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
the occupants of these buildings called them castles and they are considered a variety of castle within the genre
there were political and economic motives for building these unique structures
of the surviving medieval tower houses a couple of them have wall paintings an extraordinarily exceptional feature that make them special
tower houses in england scotland wales and ireland the motte and bailey castle was introduced in england after the norman conquest
the reign of william the conqueror was subject to revolts and sieges
william began a royal program of castle building for defensive purposes and to house garrisons and supplies
the motte and bailey consisted of wooden fortresses on top of earthworks such as a hill or a ring of raised earth
these were later replaced by castles made of stone with square tower keeps
a cluster of castles sharing some common control could represent a considerable concentration of political power
along with the king greater barons built castles too
they served three purposes
first it was the home of the king or lord containing domestic apartments and facilities allowing for the entertainment of guests
they were used to store arms and armor the treasury bread grains meat and fodder along with imported wines
secondly they served a defensive purpose
in particular barons were encouraged to build castles creating a deliberate defensive scheme along the borders of scotland and wales
thirdly it was used as an administrative center
under royal and baronial administration courts would meet and accounts could be audited within the castle

men at arms and knights became expensive to maintain
consequently more mercenary soldiers were used
castles in england were less important during what later came to be known as the wars of the roses when warfare changed to pitched battles in open fields rather than sieges
the ranks of barons were reduced and were replaced politically and socially by the peerage who grew richer as a consequence
the gentry and some knights started to gain wealth by trade profits from war or public office or marrying into rich families
this was a time of ambition and social emulation
they began to build semi fortified manor houses with square tower keeps crenellations and a gatehouse
a tower house as one ’s home was a symbol of status power and rank denoting the owner could look after himself and protect his valuable possessions
the tower house was the simplest most functional and most cost effective approach for defense against neighbors and enemies
tower houses began to be built in cities along the coast and in the marches and borders
they were never conceived as a means for planned defense and if there were more in some areas than in others it was only because the dangers were more apparent in those areas
stokesay castle in shropshire while appearing to be similar to the tower keeps of castles dating from the twelfth century it differed in several ways
there was no forebuilding it was entered from ground level and it was more lightly built and for the most part not attached to a larger fortified area
it was basically a secure house consisting of a vertical range of rooms each of which was only entered into by stairs
it was designed to create security and make entry as difficult as possible
tower houses were notably plain commonly rectangular and three stories with some having four stories
moldings around windows and doors were very simple
the ground floor was typically used for storage and sometimes had a separate entrance
the first floor was usually a hall with a fireplace and private chambers would be on the upper floors
there would sometimes be a fireplace on the upper levels too with the chimneys enclosed within the wall
a winding staircase would be built into the thickness of the wall or would be in a projecting corner tower
there is scarce evidence for a kitchen or other rooms for storage and preparation of food
the kitchen was more likely to catch on fire so it was probably in another building possibly made of wood and so has since been destroyed

sometimes two of the four sides would be gabled
there were many differences in the architecture of these towers with regional variations of design between scotland the borders and the rest of england
in england the towers were generally annexed to a hall
a northern tower was usually a stand alone edifice while a southern tower would be connected to the hall
the urban tower house was a rarity in england
we know of baynard ’s castle in london which lasted into the thirteenth century when the site was given to the dominicans
there is evidence of a handful of other tower houses in london mentioned in chronicles and in the requests for licenses to crenellate
king richard ii is known to have built a tower at the corner of his private palace at westminster
there is evidence of other urban towers in lincoln and winchester
tower houses in the south near the coast were probably intended to give protection from seaborne raiders and pirates
these towers gave short term protection against a small force who purpose was to seize booty rather than territory
tower houses were a far more numerous and common feature in northern england and the borders where security was an issue
some noted examples of tower houses that can still be seen in england include sizergh in cumbria arnside tower in cumbria piel tower house on the furness peninsula halloughton in nottingham stokesay castle in shropshire lympne castle in kent godlingston manor in dorset pengersick castle in cornwall and kyme in lincolnshire just to name a few
the best surviving tower house of lowland england is longthorpe tower in peterborough one of the tower houses with an exceptional feature
longthorpe is a three story tower that was added to an older house and built between 1290 and 1300 by the thorpe family who went from peasants to knights in just three generations
the family bought their freedom during the reign of king john
by 1260 they were knights and had the resources to build a manor at longthorpe along with a chapel
around 1300 the tower was added to the manor as a status symbol

photo from geography.org.uk by julian dowse the most notable feature of longthorpe tower are the remarkable and rare wall paintings on the first floor that date from 1330 1350
they cover all available surfaces and give a unique insight into the forms of decoration that ornamented houses of high status individuals in the fourteenth century
these particular paintings contain a variety of references to the illuminated manuscripts of the period including a wheel of five senses local country scenes musicians heraldry religious secular and mythical subjects and images of birds and animals
after edward iii ’s attempt to invade scotland failed those in power in westminster lost interest in the border regions
it was up to local families such as the percys the nevilles and the dacres to justify their jurisdictional powers and they built many tower houses for protection against raiders
the same thing happened on the scottish side of the boundary and tower houses lie thick along the valleys of the esk liddel teviot and jed water
the style of these scottish tower houses is similar to the english tower houses with some subtle differences
they were larger and had a higher degree of elaboration
in the sixteenth century there was a tendency toward steep ridge roof and gables instead of battlements parapets and a rampart walk
also some of the houses had at the corners corbelled bartizans which were favored by the french
the men who built these homes had substantial wealth and there was greater attention to comfort with more fireplaces and latrines
the architecture became more complex with wings being added giving more space within the tower
some surviving tower houses in scotland include hallbar in south lanarkshire and craigievar castle castle fraser and crathes castle all in aberdeenshire
one of the finest examples of a medieval scottish tower house is craigmillar castle in edinburgh built by the wealth preston family
ruins of craigmillar castle photo by the author)tower houses exist but are notably rare in wales and the march
however the irish enthusiastically adopted the practice of building castles and tower houses
the tower houses of ireland were primarily the defended homes of the wealthy landowning class
they were built by the anglo irish as well as gaelic families during the years 1400 to 1650
bunratty castle in co. clare ireland
the majority of the castles in ireland are tower houses
these castles may have been scaled down versions of earlier anglo norman keeps or possibly the secular equivalent of belfry towers that were built by irish abbeys and monasteries in the fifteenth century
the idea for them could also have been imported from england scotland or the continent
in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries there was a transformation from arable to pastoral agriculture which resulted in a fragmentation in major lordships
smaller lordships were created along with greater wealth and the proliferation of tower house construction
thoor ballylee tower house in co. galway ireland
photo from geograph.org.uk by james yardley tower houses in ireland provided protection from disorderly neighbors and raiders held the administration of the estate and were the social centers of the rural community
the majority of these buildings were rectangular nearly square and had tall walls
one would enter the lobby of the tower and on one side there might be a small porter ’s station and on the other a spiral staircase to the upper levels
some irish tower houses had a straight flight of stone steps within the thickness of a side wall instead of a spiral
the chambers above would contain deep wall cupboards and fireplaces and narrow slit windows
the spiral staircase would end at the parapet which consisted of a wall walk with some crenelation
after the tudor conquest of ireland and especially after cromwell and the new model army crushed opposition in ireland the humble tower house became obsolete
some examples of tower houses in ireland that still exist are kinlough castle in co. galway dunguire castle in co. galway bunratty castle in co. clare bourchiers castle in co.

tower houses in france italy and central europe tower houses were exceedingly popular across other parts of europe as well especially in northern and central italy where by the end of the twelfth century feuds between ruling families often turned deadly
families ruling different sections of italian cities started to erect towers meant to be safe havens when the need arose
standing as symbols of strength and prestige the higher the tower the more influential and powerful the patrician family
in the tuscan town of san gimignano known as the city of beautiful towers the ruling families built seventy two towers
today fourteen of them survive the tallest being torre grossa which is 54 meters 177 feet high and dates from 1298

the tower houses on the continent especially in france did not differ much in structure from the british ones
in fact when erecting their towers the british and scottish nobles drew some inspiration from the french towers as mentioned above
tower houses in france were more fortified than those in england because hostilities were common due to international conflicts such as the hundred years war and to internal feuds
consequently french tower houses display formidable and impressive additional defenses
a few surviving examples include the well preserved tower house of chevenon which was built by jean iii de chevenon between 1395 and 1406
the rectangular three storied tower house at rosieres has a roof covered parapet and corner bartizans and the more slender but taller tower house of coraboeuf was built before 1450 and has a ground floor entrance and bartizans
some of the tower houses listed as historical monuments have been purchased by private owners and turned into rental houses for tourists
one such example is the thirteenth century maison du sénéchal in the fortified village at the base of the royal château de najac aveyron in midi pyrenees
there are a few surviving examples of tower houses in central europe but one of the best preserved is the ducal tower at siedlecin in lower silesia poland
it dates from 1315/1316 and is representative of a medieval seat built for both residential and defensive purposes near the river bóbr crossing by duke henryk i of jawor 1292 96/1346

the most siginificant alteration since the fourteenth century is the addition of a roof in the sixteenth century
adjacent to the tower is a manor house which also dates from this period
the tower has a basement with three stories of living rooms above remarkably intact
the massive tie beams are the oldest surviving wooden ceiling in poland
dendrochronolocial research has revealed the trees used for their construction were cut down in 1313 and 1314

like longthorpe tower in england the south wall has a remarkable set of murals commissioned by duke henryk
the paintings depict sir lancelot of the lake and his marvelous exploits
they are undisputedly the tower ’s greatest treasure
today the ducal tower of siedlecin is the only place in the world where lancelot paintings have been preserved in situ
