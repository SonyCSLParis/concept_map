medieval castle history

the earliest types of fortifications originated in the lands of the fertile crescent egypt
china also had settlements which were protected by large walls
the northern part of europe started their defensive structures later than the eastern part and as soon as the bronze age came hill forts started popping up in lands right across europe
construction of castles used the early forms of architecture and all castles were built according to the surrounding region and country which they were protecting
the castles were built to house military units and nobility
