castles castles were built during the middle ages as fortified homes for kings and nobility
why did they build castles
during the middle ages much of europe was divided up between lords and princes
they would rule the local land and all the people who lived there
in order to defend themselves they built their homes as large castles in the center of the land they ruled
they could defend from attacks as well as prepare to launch attacks of their own from their castles
originally castles were made of wood and timber
later they were replaced with stone to make them stronger
castles were often built at the top of hills or where they could use some natural features of the land to help with their defense
after the middle ages castles were n't built as much especially as larger artillery and cannon were designed that could easily knock down their walls

it could be filled with water and there was typically a drawbridge across it to get to the castle gate
