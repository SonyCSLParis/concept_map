medieval european castles wonders are there any to suggest for me to look at i am currently trying to design a european city and castle and draw it out but the best i can do right now is draw a sand castle so are there any good ones out there that you do n't mind sharing
time period is during the middle ages and also it can be anywhere in europe from the east to the west

royal castles as far as i know were fortified just like any other one but they generally were much more luxurious than something along the lines of the welsh castle that i showed you which was a purely military installation
castle building really changed in the 15th century when artillery became powerful enough to break down castle walls
with the obsolescence of military oriented castles you see a change to indefensible palace castles like neuschwanstein in germany

yeah cities i want to also know what the houses looked like and the regular streets of a big city when thinking of a medieval castle town i always think of rothenburg germany which has many original houses from the medieval period
these were generally wattle and daub structures with timber frames
