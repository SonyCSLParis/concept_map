bramshill has a distinguished and fascinating history
early mentions of the historic estate can be traced to the domesday book of 1086 however the recognisable mansion of today owes itself to the designs and efforts of edward 11th lord zouche of harringworth who acquired the estate in 1605
over a ten year period edward reconstructed the mansion culminating in a visit from king james i in 1620 and the archbishop of canterbury in 1621
the property then exchanged hands between the earl of antrim and sir robert henley before sir john cope purchased the mansion in 1699 where it would remain with the cope family for 236 years
during the second world war the house was used by the red cross before serving as a home for the exiled king of romania and his family
the estate was purchased in 1953 by the home office and from 1960 the mansion and surrounding grounds were used as a police training college
the mansion is in a highly desirable commuter location with regular rail services from nearby winchfield and fleet both providing direct services into london waterloo in less than fifty minutes
the site also lies within ten miles of both the m4 and the m3 which gives access to london and the national motorway network and heathrow 35 miles and gatwick airports 53 miles
