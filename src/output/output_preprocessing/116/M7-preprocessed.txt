jacobean architecture jacobean architecture
style of english architecture of the reign of king james i and vi 1603–25 not greatly differing from elizabethan architecture and largely continuing into the reign of charles i 1625–49
it was essentially a mélange of flemish french and italian renaissance influences with pronounced emphases on themes drawn from flemish mannerism including jewelled strapwork and grotesque ornament
assemblages of orders emblems heraldic devices herms and obelisks abounded while curved and dutch gables were also favoured
traces of gothic especially perpendicular architecture remained notably the continuing use of mullioned and transomed windows and the late medieval e- and h plans were also used
good examples of jacobean architecture are hatfield house herts 1607–12 bramshill surrey 1605–12 and audley end essex 1603–16
however inigo jones 's contributions also took place in the reigns of james i and vi and charles i but his sophisticated italian style is not described as jacobean
there was a jacobean revival in c19 notably in country houses and it was also mixed with the queen anne style to produce a singularly curious hybrid e.g. r. n. shaw 's new zealand chambers london 1872–3 demolished bibliographyairs 1995);cruickshank ed 1996);lampugnani ed dinsmoor 1986);mowl 1993);pe boe 1951 sturgis et al
