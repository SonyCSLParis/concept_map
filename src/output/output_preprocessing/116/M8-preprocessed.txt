bramshill house history original house the 1086 domesday book lists one of the two manors of bromeselle as held by hugh de port whose family were in possession of it for nine generations
the last of the de port line william de port died in 1346 without leaving a male heir
in the early 14th century sir john foxley baron of the exchequer built and endowed a chapel in the village of bramshill his first wife constance de bramshill may have been the heiress of the bramshill family
their son thomas foxley became mp for berkshire in 1325 and was appointed constable of windsor castle in 1328 soon after the accession of the 14 year old edward iii
in 1347 he obtained a licence to build a manor house or small castle at bramshill which included a 2,500 acre wooded park
the house built between 1351 and 1360 had thick walls vaulted cellars and an internal courtyard measuring 100 feet by 80 feet
based on the similarity of the surviving vaults under bramshill house and those under what became the servants hall and steward 's room at windsor castle it may have been a copy of william of wykeham 's work there
the estate remained in the hands of the foxley family and their heirs the essex family until 1499 when it was sold to giles daubeney 1st baron daubeney
giles 's son henry daubeney sold the property to henry viii and in 1547 edward vi granted the estate to william paulet whose heirs sold it in 1600 to sir stephen thornhurst of agnes court kent new manor house in march 1605 edward la zouche 11th baron zouche a favourite of james i bought the property from thornhurst
a house was earlier planned on the site for henry frederick prince of wales whose heraldic feathers are displayed above the central pediment
lord zouche demolished a large part of the building and began to build the bramshill house of today
henry shaw describes the new house which zouche built as a specimen of elizabethan architecture merits particular attention exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable with a suite of apartments both large and lofty
the amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence
 an inventory taken in 1634 after zouche 's death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments and revealed that the maids chamber was of a very high standard james zouch grandson of edward la zouche sold the property to the earl of antrim in 1637 at which time the house 's furniture was valued at £ 2,762
during the reign of charles i the house was partly destroyed by a fire
on 25 june 1640 lord antrim sold bramshill for £ 9,500 to sir robert henley
in 1673 it was the property of his son sir andrew henley 1st baronet
sir john cope purchased the property in 1699 and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935
the cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703 converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century
they were responsible for much of the interior with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920
after his victory over napoleon the duke of wellington was offered his choice of house by parliament he visited bramshill but in 1817 chose stratfield saye instead
sporting events numerous paintings and prints depict games and social events taking place on the lawn one such painting by joseph nash now in the national fencing museum depicts 17th century rapier practice with a number of upper class men women and children as spectators
the cricket ground at the house first played host to a first class match in 1823 when an early hampshire team played an england xi
hampshire won by five wickets
two further first class matches were played there in 1825 when hampshire drew against godalming and defeated sussex
a final first class match was held there in 1826 when a combined hampshire and surrey team played and lost to sussex
modern times in 1935 the house was purchased from the cope family by ronald nall cain 2nd baron brocket the house 's last private owner
it was used by the red cross as a maternity home during the second world war after which it became the home of the exiled king michael and queen anne of romania for several years
bramshill house became a grade i listed building on 8 july 1952 and was acquired by the british government the following year as a dedicated site for police training
it became the location of the national police college in 1960
from 2005 two buildings on the site housed the european police college until it was moved to budapest in 2014
by the late 1980s the estate had become expensive to maintain and according to sir john wheeler chair of the home affairs select committee by 1989 it was in a poor state of repair
the daily mail reported that the police were criticised for subsequent lavish spending on the estate including £ 1,800 for a beehive £ 750,000 on restoring a bridge and £ 2 million for the access drive
in july 2013 the home office placed the house and estate on the market for £ 25 million citing costs of £ 5 million to run it annually
it was sold to the heritage property developers city country in august 2014
bramshill house architecture exteriorthe 15 bedroom bramshill house is one of the largest and most important jacobean mansions in england described as one of the glories of english architecture by the historians anthony blunt and james lees milne
the architecture of the three storey building was inspired by the italian renaissance and was executed mainly by german builders
it is approximately 140 feet in length
the design is traditionally attributed to the architect john thorpe although no records remain to confirm the attribution
the building stands on the edge of a plateau overlooking the park to the south
the plan of the house is unusual partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building it extends at right angles to the primary façade
the elevations are symmetrical facing outwards but the interior court is narrow and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides
bramshill house is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east
there are three vaulted cellars to the west
the house is built of red brick laid in english bond dressed with stone with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings
stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows
an open carved parapet surmounts the building
the roof consists of red tiles and there are large gables on the west side
the chimney stacks are rectangular
north and south the north façade has three bays separated by windows and features a loggia typical of early 17th century houses with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches
the central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched dutch gable which shelters a small statue of lord zouche or james i. there are small obelisks at either side of the gable
thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side building on the gatehouse of the earlier foxley house
the southern façade was described by nikolaus pevsner as among the most fanciful pieces of jacobean design in
it is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing with five inner sections
the outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor
the inner two sections feature the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor but the ground floor features two arches which form part of the central loggia
the stone central bay 20 feet wide is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the doric ionic and corinthian orders surmounted by a florid perforated pediment
in addition there is an oriel window on the first floor above the main entrance
an important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace 25 feet in width between the projecting wings a kind of architectural foreground to the garden
the terrace is bounded by a 3 feet 3 inches high balustrade
the arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of italian domestic architecture used in villas
the triglyphs and ornamented metopes together with the simple capitals of the columns indicate the doric order but are light enough to be ionic
east and west the east façade is the longest about 124 feet wide and two storeys high
it features four full height angular bays with two windows between while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel
on this side there is a troco terrace with a lawn as well as two arcaded openings at the side on either wing of the house
the southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables one of which is older and octagonal
carved in the wall at the side is a frieze consisting of four squares each depicting an animal a lion an elephant a wild boar and a camel
the west façade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables the windows on the ground floor are sashed
interiorthe mansion is richly furnished with period pieces
many of the rooms have large tapestries on their panelled walls depicting historical figures and scenes
those in the drawing room contain scenes from roman history and were based on designs by peter paul rubens who supervised the work in brussels
these tapestries were initially made for dudley carleton 1st viscount dorchester zouche 's brother diplomat but in the end he rejected them for another set how the first set came to bramshill is not known
rubens sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the munich gallery alte pinakothek
the ground floor contains in the west section the former dining room and kitchen
the openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under sir william henry cope uncovering an original doorway with a four centred pointed arch
cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted
the billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas
the great hall to which an arcaded porch gives direct access retains the basic design of the original construction
it has a dais and a jacobean stone screen 13 feet high decorated with 92 shields
resident families emblazoned the shields with the arms of ancestors and family members
the entablature of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of 2 feet 6 inches
beyond the dais double doors lead into the terrace hall at the foot of the staircase
across from this is the former dining room containing a large tapestry believed to be made by an english artist representing forest scenery in very subdued colours
during the time of the cope family in the 1880s the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy
the kitchen and the adjoining room had back to back fireplaces
drawing room and library the drawing room containing four bay windows of different sizes is panelled with oak for its entire height of about 16 feet
one of the upper panels surmounted by its corinthian entablature is a frieze depicting a fig grape and pomegranate each with foliage and blossoms
one of the lower panels part of the dado in the same room has a section of projecting mouldings
the upper panel is 2 feet 10 inches by 2 feet 4 inches the lower 2 feet 7 inches by 2 feet 6 inches
the massive chimneypiece in the drawing room is classically designed believed to be inspired by one of the great italian architects of 16th century mannerism giacomo barozzi da vignola
it is two storeys in height the lower being doric and the upper ionic
the distribution of the members is regular and the shafts of the columns are variegated marble
the upper compartment of the chimney piece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre
the fireplace is 6 feet wide and 4 feet 8 inches high and retains the ancient andirons used for burning wood
these are large and well adorned particularly in the lower part
the ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house
the plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship 1 foot 7 inches wide it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern with an evident florentine influence
in the 1880s the library had a collection of 5,000 volumes about half the number of books the cope family owned at the time
staircase and first floor the standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from eversley manor house and probably date to the mid-17th century although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century
the walls above the stairs and on the first floor landing contain some very large paintings including several portraits
beyond the staircase are the state rooms and what was known as the wrought room
the room has an ornamental ceiling with a renaissance chimneypiece
two of the bedrooms the two white rooms were originally connected to what was called the flower de luce room but the doors were boarded up
the long gallery fills the first floor of the northern range 126.5 feet long and with a richly decorated stucco ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece it formerly contained a very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters
also on the first floor is the chapel drawing room in the south wing connected to the drawing room
the copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel which is entered through it
the current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the virgin mary st. stephen st. mary magdalene and st. john the evangelist by alexander rowan and dated by pevsner to about 1840
the tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier in the early 19th century it had hung in the red drawing room
when the chapel ceiling was restored by sir william cope it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood
the large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel
