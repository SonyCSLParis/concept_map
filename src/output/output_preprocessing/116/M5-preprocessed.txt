he was a royal ward from 1570 under the care of william cecil

they had two daughters elizabeth and mary but shortly after mary 's birth in 1582 zouche abandoned his wife and they lived apart until her death in 1611
eleanor 's father wrote to lord burghley complaining of her treatment:'my lord souche sic put away this his lady twenty nine years ago and refusing her all allowance was by law sentenced there unto which he not performing was excomunicate from which he went beyond sea and returning was ordered to pay her 50s the week from which poor allowance with a small addition from her friends hath this baron 's wife ever since lived
she was oft dangerously sick that physic was chargeable
he never disbursed a penny and now dead she might have rotted in her chamber ere he would have buried her

he was also interested in horticulture his house in hackney included a physic garden and he employed matthias l'obel as his gardener
the house in hackney lay on the north side of homerton high street probably on the site of the present dean close
the herbalist john gerard visited hackney and was given foreign seeds from zouche 's garden
zouche ceased to be a hackney resident before his death in 1625 and it is likely his house was sold in 1620 to sir julius caesar master of the rolls
in 1605 zouche purchased the manor of bramshill in hampshire and almost immediately began to build the mansion that currently stands on the site
james i stayed at bramshill in 1620 and the next year george abbot archbishop of canterbury went down to bramshill to consecrate a chapel for lord zouche
6 the visit had disastrous consequences for the archbishop when he accepted zouche 's invitation to a stag hunt where abbot accidentally killed a gamekeeper who strayed into his line of fire
although all the witnesses including zouche agreed that it was a tragic accident abbot 's reputation never recovered from the fact that he was the only archbishop of canterbury ever to kill a man

mystery of more children on the mayflower in 1959 a document was found in the house of sir jasper more that solved a mystery concerning four children who travelled to america on the mayflower in 1620
it was first printed by richmond herald college of arms sir anthony wagner in 1960
sir anthony was a childhood friend of sir jasper more
it was also published in the times
10 the document was entitled a true declaracon of the disposinge of the four childrtn of samuell more in answer to katherine more 's petition to the right honorable ~ sir james ley knight and baronet lord chief justice of england and dated 1622
11]in 1620 lord zouche provided counsel and other help in this incident involving him and his longtime secretary samuel more who was in his employ at the time of zouche 's death in 1625
12][13
samuel more was the eldest son of a respected parliamentarian from shropshire richard more
he had married in 1610/11 to a cousin katherine more,[14 and by 1616 was charging that she had committed adultery with a longtime lover conceiving four children by him
15 there followed four rancorous years and twelve court appearances which culminated in the four children being sent without their mother 's knowledge,[16 as indentured servants in 1620 bound for the colony of virginia on the ship mayflower
11 this was done on the counsel of lord zouche who was a virginia company commissioner,[17][18 acting on the request of samuel more and his father richard who were searching for a location far away to which the children could be sent
19 due to winter weather the ship did not reach virginia but instead anchored far to the north in cape cod harbor with three of the four more children dying the first winter
20 only five year old richard more survived
