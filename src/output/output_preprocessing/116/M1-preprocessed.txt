how a new york society girl came to inherit the ghost of an english bride june 6 2013 by freaky folk tales the mistletoe bride in 1923 one of the most touching and melodramatic of legends connected with the ancient castles of england was brought vividly to the attention of an american readership by the reported appearance of the mistletoe bride this most thrilling of old english family legends tells of a bride who was lost on her wedding day and not found until fifty years afterward
several versions of the legend are in existence
they represent the strange and tragic events as occurring in many different old families and castles
although there is some uncertainty concerning the supposed scene of this old tragedy owing to its great antiquity the researches of historians and antiquarians have proved that it most probably occurred at bramshill house in hampshire the seat of the very ancient cope family
t. f. thiselton dyer who made the most exhaustive study of old english romances and mysteries writes in his strange pages from family papers the chest in which the mistletoe bride was found is shown to visitors at bramshill house hampshire the residence of sir john cope
now this statement was of peculiar interest because in 1923 a charming american society girl miss edna hilton had just become the bride of captain denzil cope heir of sir anthony cope the chief of the ancient family that had long occupied the old house
the mistletoe bride bramshill house mrs cope was well known in new york society as she was one of the hilton family that inherited part of the stewart millions
for several years before her marriage she lived in paris where her mother mrs edward baker hilton had a magnificent apartment
young mrs cope now virtually became the owner of the famous chest in which the poor bride was locked up and lost
americans who knew her were intensely curious to know what experiences she would have with such a gruesome relic
it was said that persons staying in the house were kept awake at night by the stifled moans of a woman in terrible agony
they would hear muffled sounds like those of a person beating on the interior of a thick wooden chest
there was little surprise in the considerable gossip that attached itself to the new mrs cope and her unusual home
the chattering classes of new york society discussed the matter at length
what would the new bride do with the tragic chest would she have the hardihood to climb into it herself
would she send it away for fear of it being haunted by the bride who died in it
would she remove the great lock that was the real cause of the tragedy
the papers of the day did not have to wait long before actual testimonies of encounters with spectres began to emerge from the strange old house
one visiting english society woman reported during the night i had the most terrifying experience
shortly after midnight i was awakened suddenly with a sensation that i was not alone in the bedroom
then from behind the ancient oak panelling i heard noises of light hurrying footsteps
what followed was even more terrifying
i heard moans of the most heartrending kind and then strange sounds like hands beating upon a wooden partition
the moans so terrified me that i fainted away and it was daylight when i recovered consciousness
i made an excuse for leaving the castle and hurried away the mistletoe bride bramshill house not long after this one of the old retainers at the castle who subsequently soon departed declared that in the stillness of the night he heard the clatter of bony feet hurrying up the stairway into the attic
with this came an accompanying sound like the swish of skirts and later on a muffled thump like the falling of a cover of a heavy chest
while the story of the mistletoe bride has figured in several novels and plays it is most familiar through the dainty old song of that name by thomas haynes bayly
it was a great favourite in days gone by and perhaps even today there are some who remember it
the old song begins the mistletoe hung in the castle hall the holly branch shone on the old oak wall;and the baron ’s retainers were blithe and gay and keeping their christmas holiday
the baron beheld with a father ’s pride his beautiful child young lovell ’s bride;while she with her bright eyes seemed to be the star of the goodly company 
they sought her that night and they sought her next day and they sought her in vain while a week passed away;in the highest the lowest the loneliest spot young lovell sought wildly but found her not
and years flew by and their grief at last was told as a sorrowful tale long
past;and when lovell appeared the children cried,“see the old man weeps for his fairy bride 
closed with a spring and dreadful doom the bride lay clasped in her living tomb
in his song bayly says that it was lord lovell ’s bride who hid from her lord in the old oak chest
he does not mention the bride ’s name but from various other sources it is known that she belonged to the ancient family of the copes who possess the chest in which she died
bramshill house was bought by lord zouche a noted statesman adventurer and philosopher of the elizabethan period
he was a friend of the famous william cecil the chief minister of queen elizabeth and was closely associated with francis bacon the earl of leicester the earl of essex sir walter raleigh and other great characters of that period
lord zouche used all of his wealth in building his mansion
ever since then it was considered one of the noblest and most beautiful monuments of elizabethan architecture in england
it is also one of the largest of english mansions
to the new mrs cope the size of the house must have appeared daunting
the great house stretched a distance of 150 feet at its greatest length and was built in the form of an e the middle bar of the letter having the main entrance at its front end
high above the entrance was a great statue of lord zouche the founder of the house in full armour within an architectural niche
the finery was contained within great oak panelled halls and gilded salons and immense corridors stretching out in vistas that ended in dim shadows
there were almost incalculable treasures in the form of pictures old furniture immense tables curiously carved chests old plate and beautifully wrought metal work
so vast were the apartments that even persons who had spent their lives there would not have been familiar with all of them
in the tremendously thick walls there were said to be many secret chambers
one was the study to which lord zouche retired for his philosophical and scientific work
the great house was so costly that the descendants of lord zouche were not able to keep it
it then passed into possession of the copes a very ancient family who hitherto had their principal seat at banbury
they enjoyed one of the earliest created baronetcies
most of the cope baronets had borne the christian name john but several had been christened denzil like the new incumbent
one of the early sir johns had a very beautiful daughter who became affianced to lord lovell a very wealthy young nobleman
his title by the way had long become extinct and the family had completely disappeared
the wedding festivities were held in sir john cope ’s stately mansion
when the wedding was under discussion christmas happened to be approaching and sir john thought it would be a splendid idea to combine the happy event with the usual festivities of the season
weddings were attended with unrestrained revelry in those days and was an occasion of tremendous merry making and feasting
the wedding festivities even in the noblest families were often conducted with a gaiety and abandon than would have seemed shocking to the refined tastes of the modern age
the guests after partaking of vast amounts of wine and spirits sometimes fought for the vestiges of the bride ’s most intimate apparel and before finally leaving the house insisted upon arranging the happy pair on the nuptial couch
for these reasons the wedding at bramshill house was one of the greatest and merriest that had ever been known in england
the great house was filled with distinguished guests from all parts of the country
most of the nobility and the great landed squires came with their families
the banquet was of amazing lavishness
a great wild boar roasted and stuffed and arranged with head and tusks raised up in a life like manner was borne into the banquet hall on a gigantic platter by the cope retainers musicians played and sang appropriate music up in the minstrels galleries all the time
details of the fare served on this wonderful occasion are still preserved in the archives of the ancient house
two hundred geese and two hundred ducks were among the substantial delicacies provided for the guests
these birds were especially fat and luscious for the copes had for centuries held the honourable court office of sergeant of the poultry to his majesty the king
wine was consumed in proportionate quantities for sir john possessed a rare store of malmsey malvorsie cyprus canary and goodness knows how many more
after dinner there was dancing and music in the great hall
the little bride grew weary of the feasting and drinking and merry making
she drew her husband and a few of the younger men and girls together and proposed that they should play hide and seek
in this simple game a girl hid herself and the first man who found her had the privilege of kissing her
i will begin said the bride
give me five minutes to hide myself and then see if you can find me
they all turned away until the time was up and then started to hunt for her
the young bridegroom was naturally anxious to be the first to find her
they hunted and hunted but without success
for several hours they laughed at the girl ’s trick thinking how clever she was to hide herself so thoroughly
at last it dawned on them that the matter was serious
guests and servants were formed into parties and searched the house from top to bottom
every room every closet was searched
the evening wore away and the night came
the distracted bridegroom was left without a bride
many persons thought that the bride with female capriciousness had run away from the house
days passed and months and years and she was never heard from
the unhappy lord lovell never believed for a moment that his bride had deserted him
he was sure from the first that some tragedy had befallen her
he spent his whole life searching for his lost bride
he did not want to leave the place where he had last seen her and was willingly accommodated by her sorrowing father
lord lovell grew old and withered but his passionate quest for his lost bride kept him alive
the younger generation thought him a harmless madman
one day fifty years after the wedding he was running his hand for the thousandth time over the oaken panelling of a room on the top floor
he touched a spot of the elaborately carved woodwork accidentally
the panelling flew open and revealed a secret closet
within stood an ancient oak chest ironbound dusty with years solid and beautifully carved
it had evidently been a secret repository for important documents
lord lovell felt that he was near the end of his quest
he secured tools and broke open the ancient chest
within lay the body of his lost bride now a fleshless skeleton wearing the beautiful wedding robes in which he had last seen her
the wedding dress was yellow and stained with age and corruption
her fleshless hand was raised in a pathetic attitude as it trying to open the door of her tomb
the mistletoe bride bramshill house evidently the little bride had learned of the secret closet in some way and had run to it thinking to give her pursuers a hard puzzle
she stepped into the chest and pulled the lid over her
it closed with a strong spring and she was unable to open it
the lid was heavy and fitted closely and she died a most agonising death
that the body never betrayed its presence by any odour was explained by the fact that it was on the top floor
it was near a chimney and the warmth helped to carry the odour away through the roof
when lord lovell had completed his life long quest he had nothing more to live for
he faded away and died in a few weeks
the tragedy is one that naturally grips the popular imagination
hence it has for centuries been made the subject of poems and ballads
the cruel death of the beautiful bride on her wedding day is perhaps the most tragic combination of circumstances that could possibly be imagined
the mind becomes fascinated with terror as it imagines and dwells on the feelings of the bride who finds herself condemned to a slow and agonising death at the very moment when she expected to be enjoying the most delightful day of her life
perhaps her living death lasted through the whole night following her wedding day
it is hard to say just how long breathing could have continued
the air in the chest alone would not have kept a person alive for that time
the heavy lid fits very closely but it may be possible that sufficient air may have entered from the outside to support life for some hours beyond that made possible by the capacity of the chest alone
if air did enter in this way it would have made the girl ’s martyrdom more lingering and cruel
did she hear the footsteps of her bridegroom searching for her in the night
that is barely possible
it is not surprising however that her cries could not be heard for the old oak chest was immensely thick with a tight fitting lid and then in addition there was the barrier of the thick oaken partition which would have shut out her cries from the searchers
for many years thereafter the classic chest was exhibited to visitors at bramshill park
when edna hilton married her husband took her to bramshill park for a period
but the copes were far too wealthy to be restricted to one residence in england and as it was quite in the order of events that the young couple should later move to oxfordshire
and move to oxfordshire they did lovell castle to be precise where the spectre appears to have followed them for shortly after they took residence it became the scene of manifestations lurid enough to make the stoutest heart quake and the most normal pulse race a good deal faster
but perhaps these are tales of haunting best left for another day to be continued
