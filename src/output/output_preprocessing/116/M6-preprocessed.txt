a chimne'ij -piece in the great hall at hard wick hall derbyshire the seat of his grace the duke of devonshire k. g. date 1597 ^havdwick hall stands in a fine park adorned byvenerable oaks and upon a very high ridge of ground commanding amost extensive and delightful prospect into the adjacent country moreespecially towards the west
the mansion was built in 1597 by elizabeth countess of shrewsbury daughter of john hardwick esq this lady had been married twice before she became the wife of the earl of shrewsbury first to robert bailey esq and sir wi uiamcavendish and it was not till after the death of her first two husbands that she erected this stately edifice
there are very few mansions like hardwick which give so clear and complete an idea of the architec tural taste of the times in which it was built and by the singular o oodtaste of the possessors it has been suffered to remain in its primitive state with much of the ancient furniture to this day
over this chimney piece in the great hall is a beautiful arabesque compartment of verylarge size in which is fully displayed the armorial achievement of the countess of shrewsbury the lozenge formed shield is charged with asaltier engrailed and in chief three roses her paternal arms of hard wick as now quartered by the present duke the supporters are twohinds each collared the whole painted and emblazoned
in the great hall is the history of patient grizel in old tapestry and in the galleryis a very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters

35eldest son of king james i. who died at the age of eighteen in theyear 1612
bramshill house was the residence of edward lord zouch of harringworth a nobleman highly favoured by king james who appointed him lord warden of the cinque ports and constableof dover castle
bramshill park is not large but there is an historical anecdote con nected with it which gives the spot some interest
dr. george abbot archbishop of canterbury who took an active part in all the greattransactions of state when in a declining state of health used in thesummer to retire into hampshire for the sake of recreation and hadaccepted an invitation from lord zouch to hunt the fallow deer in hispark at bramshill
during the enjoyment of his sport he one dayaccidentally killed that nobleman 's keeper by an arrow from a crossbow which he had aimed at one of the herd
this misfortune threw the archbishop into a deep melancholy and the prelate ever afterwardskept a monthly fast on tuesday the day on which this fatal accidenthappened
the archbishop 's conduct was submitted to inquiry but itdid not lessen him in the king 's favour who observed that an angelmight have miscarried in this sort and accordingly his majesty grantedhim pardon and declared him still capable of all the authority of aprimate
in the reign of charles i. bramshill house was partly destroyed byfire a circumstance which is noticed by fuller
in 1673 it was theresidence of sir andrew henley bart but has been for a considerabletime the property of the family of the present possessor one of whichbuilt the mansion at kensington now called holland house plate xxx
the oriel window in the western elevation of bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 in the architecture of bramshill house is to be observed the attempt at italian improvement then newly introduced
the main building three stories in height andabout one hundred and forty feet in extent is constructed with brick with stone dressings to the numerous large and lofty windows thequoins also are of stone and the whole is surmounted by an opencarved parapet of the same material
the central compartment of the36 elizabethan architecture principal front about twenty feet in width is built wholly with stone and displays a profusion of ornamental decoration including the veryfine oriel window shown on the plate
this portion of the building an interesting architectural specimen is earned up with terminal pilastersof the doric ionic and corinthian style from story to story and issurmounted by a florid pediment which is perforated
the oriel or compas window in the centre of the front is sin gularly beautiful in design with much lightness and elegance in itsdetails
this species of window is one of the most ornamental featuresin the exterior of a building and equally cheerful in the interior
inthe instance here given the beauty of its proportions renders it anexample particularly worthy of attention
plate xxxi
the elevation of the eastern side of bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 this front towards the east exhibits comparatively little ornament but shows that general unifor mity in design was preserved even although it was necessary forinternal convenience to vary the situation and size of particularwindows
in the centre of this front is a bold projection in which isthe arch of entrance and above it a bay window
this projection likethe rest of the building is crowned with an ornamental pierced parapet and the whole is surmounted by a large gable containing a recessedniche and statue of king james i. this front is about one hundredand twenty four feet in extent and two stories in height plate xxxii
the elevation of the southern side of bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 the extent of this front is aboutone hundred and ninety three feet and in height to the top of theparapet forty six feet its principal feature and most important dif ference from the other fronts of this noble building is a terrace twenty five feet in width between the projecting wings a kind of architecturalfore ground to the garden which is extremely beautiful
the terrace isbounded by a balustrade and the general effect is very striking

balustrades from the deanerij at lincoln andfrom bramshill house
date 1603 the first subject of this plateis a very beautiful crest or ornamental parapet of the deanery houseat lincoln rising three feet above the building constructed about thesame period as bramshill house
the second example shown is the pierced parapet which crownsthe whole of the house at bramshill
the height of the parapet isthree feet seven inches and the small piers about fourteen inches inwidth are about four feet five inches distant from each other the effectof the pierced work between them is very fine a more light andelegant parapet is rarely found even in the compositions of the best italian architects
the parapet a great improvement to the elevation is an architectural feature that in the elizabethan era was much varied but for simplicity of design it would be difficult to produce a finerinstance
the balusters of the terrace at bramshill which form the remainingexample are excellent in their proportions and well adapted to thepurpose for which they are applied
the height of the balustrade isthree feet three inches plate xxxiv
the arcade at bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 the arcade on the terrace of the southern front is hereshown it is a feature of domestic architecture borrowed from italy where the terrace answered the purpose of exercise and became animportant accessory to every villa
in the present design it may beobjected by the classical architect that the imposts of the arches restupon the pillars and convey an appearance of instability
this ideahas been combated by mr. woods in his letters of an architect,"who admits that the judgment does not easily reconcile itself to archesupon columns or on posts for a column is only an ornamented stonepost but he confesses that there is a delightful hghtness and airinessof effect produced by the distribution difficult to be obtained by othermeans
the enrichments of the arcade at bramshill are extremelypleasing
the order intended is doric but in this instance it is made38 elizabethan architecture to assume all the lightness of the ionic the trigh phs and ornamentedmetopes together with the simple capitals of the columns are the onlydistinctions by which the identity of the order is determined plate xxxv
the stone screen in the hall at bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 the screen at the lower end of theancient halls was a necessary arrangement to mask the entrances fromthe offices and much embellishment was usually lavished upon it
inruder times it was customary to inscribe this part of the mansion withnotices of invitation and welcome to the hospitality then ostentatiouslyexhibited as at halnaker house in sussex now belonging to the duke of richmond where the doors are labelled with the words le bien venue and come in and drinke coarsely carved
the screenat bramshill bears numerous shields seemingly intended for emblazon ment of the arms of the neighbouring gentry who might be welcome tothe spread of good cheer inseparable from the domestic establishmentof a large mansion
the simple inscription at montacute house in somersetshire and yours my friends answered the same benevo lent purpose as the emblazoned frieze at gil hng castle where themembers of every division of the county of york are separately distin guished by their family insignia
the height of the screen in the hallat bramshill is thirteen feet and the depth of the entablature con taining a double row of sculptured shields is two feet six inches
inthe spandrils of the arches are introduced small female figures one ineach emblematical of justice and wisdom industry and plenty
theorder intended in this enriched portion of the hall is corinthian but thearchitectural features are so modified by the exuberance of decorationas to be scarcely perceptible
a section of the screen is given on thesame plate by which its relative thickness may be determined and inthe details the arabesque ornaments of the sculptured shields are shownat laro;e

date 1603 in the mansions of our old no bility the next room in point of importance to the hall was the guest description of the plates 39chamber into which the company retired sometimes called the drawing room a name abbreviated from withdrawing room the phrase isgenerally supposed to be of more modern date but in the age of elizabeth whetstone in his heptameron says the queene sent forthe chosen company who were placed in the drawinge chamber proving the use of the term even before the torrent of puritanical zealhad subdued ancient splendour and french taste had been introducedin the reig n of charles ii
the drawing room at bramshill is lighted by four bay windows ofdifferent sizes and to its whole height about sixteen feet is panelledwith oak the ribs or styles being carved and the surface of the panelleft plain
the frieze is a beautiful design of a running pattern offoliage and fruit which is shown at large on the next plate togetherwith the mouldings and size of the panels
the richness occasioned bythe variations from uniformity of surface in these large rooms is verystriking plate xxxvii

ceilings at bramshill house in hampshire
bate 1603 the ceilings at bramshill are not less characteristic ofthe elizabethan period than the other architectural parts of the man sion those of the old library and drawing room have been selectedas excellent examples and it is not often that such fine specimenshave been preserved
the designs which aiford a pleasing variety are so well arranged that but httle of the plain surface is left and thecompositions abundantly ornamented are managed with all the skillnecessary to produce a light and elegant effect

the chimney piece in the drawing room at bramshill house in hampshire
date 1603 the massive appear ance of this chimney piece is not injudiciously contrasted with thelighter panelling and richly worked ceiling of the same apartment itis altogether executed in a more solid and less ornamental style of art
the design is classical and after the manner of vignola it compre hends two stories in height the lower being doric and the upper ionic
the distribution of the members is pure and regular thecolumns with their capitals and entablature are well suited to eachother and the whole is surmounted by a sculptured pediment whichlises to the cornice of the room
the shafts of the columns are ofvariegated marble and the upper compartment of the chimney pieceis composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material disposedin a manner rather formal over the surface
the frieze of the upperorder is also formed of coloured marble in the centre and over thecolumns the entablature is broken which considerably relieves theeffect and preserves the appearance of solidity produced by the boldrelief given to the several parts
the basement seems almost too lowfor the order above it
the fire place six feet in width is four feeteight inches high and retains the ancient andirons or dogs used forburnmg wood these are of the larger sort and are much ornamented particularly at the low^er part
a profile of the projection of the chimney piece is shown on the plate

the mansion wasbuilt about the year 1610 by john topp esq one of the ancestors of francis topp who was created baronet by king charles ii in 1688
the drawing room may be pronounced one of the best examples ofinterior decoration in the elizabethan style now remaining in wiltshire and the more iiiteresting from the very excellent preservation in whichits ornamental features are carefully maintained
in length this beautiful apartment is thirty three feet eight inches and in breadth exclusive of a large oriel at the upper end it is twentyfeet two inches in height the room is not more than eleven feet
it issituated in one of the angles of the mansion and is lighted on two of itssides by large bay windows
the oriel or deep recess at the upperend of the room is above eight feet square and the bays of its finetransom window contain some armorial compartments in stained glass
the chimney piece shown in the plate is two stories in height both areof the corinthian order and the coupled columns of the lower storysurmount a pedestal
in the ornaments of the frieze and the uppercompartments of the chimney piece invention has produced a variety ofarabesque forms
the whole apartment is panelled with fine oak insmall panels with bold and simple mouldings on the walls no surbaseis indicated but the corinthian pilasters are raised on very highpedestals which are enriched on the upper parts by carved ornaments taking the form of small arches their spandrils and centres filled witharabesques
the pilasters support a highly decorated frieze or mo dillioned cornice which as well as the pedestal is shown at large onthe plate
within the apartment at the lower end a most beautifulporch of carved oak is introduced which was evidently so placed tobreak the force of cold air issuing from the door
this highly enrichedportion of the room is surmounted by figures of diana minerva andf42 elizabethan architecture

the centre compartment of the arcade at hatfield house hertfordshire the seat of the marquess of salisbury date1611 hatfield house is situated on an eminence commanding viewsin every direction of an undulated country equally remarkable for itsnatural beauty and excessive fertility the park is watered by the river lea and is distant six miles from st. alban 's and seven from heitford
this house is perhaps the very first in the kingdom where a view oflandscape scenery was considered in the design its situation possessesgreat advantages to recommend the choice the ground rising with agentle ascent the mansion on every side presents itself as a noble andcommanding object
the architects john thorp bernard jansen gerard christmas robert and john smithson and nicholas stone were all in high repute at the time hatfield house was erected and itis rather singular that a building which displays a combination of archi tecture on such a magnificent scale and has attracted much admirationon account of the grandeur and beauty of its proportions should haveremained so long without the architect 's name being known but tonone of the great names of that interesting period which are extant has the merit of this excellent design yet been attributed
there iscertainly enough of the florentine manner in the beautiful arcade onthe southern front to induce an opinion that the design was procuredfrom italy but no proof can be obtained that such was really the case
the two wings on the principal front of hatfield house are con nected by a magnificent centre raised with two orders of architecture and with its entrance porch which is highly enriched may be con sidered as the most commanding feature of the edifice
the basementdescription of the plates
43story comprises an arcade or corridor extending the whole lengthbetween the wings and constructed upon the italian plan affordingmeans of exercise in the air but sheltered from the sun or rain
thedoric order adopted in this arcade agrees with the proportions usedby san gallo of florence and other italian masters the shafts resting on pedestals are partly fluted and partly covered with arabesqueornament
the tower mhich is over the central compartment of thearcade rises to the height of seventy feet and is divided into threestories having a bold projection which breaks the uniform line of thefront
the second story of the tower is of the ionic order and thethird corinthian in the last are sculptured the full armorial bearings ofthe noble founder of the mansion
the parapet is pierced \\dth the dateof the year at the completion of the building 1611 and above that arehis lordship 's armorial crest and coronet plate xlii
a compartment in the upper storij of the south front of hatfield house
date 1611 hatfield house occupies agrand parallelogram two hundred and eighty feet in length and seventyfeet in width
on the southern fi ont two wings project at right angles each one hundred feet with a breadth of eighty feet forming together with the centre division three sides of a court one hundred and forty feetin extent the extreme length of the fi ont being three hundred feet
the material of which the mansion is constructed is principally brick but the cases and mullions of the windows the ionic pilasters andarchitectural enrichments as well as all the prominent parts mostexposed to injuiy are of stone
in these the destructive effect of timeis scarcely perceptible while it has given the whole the mellow pictu resque character of age the weather stained and mossy bricks har monizing admirably with the gray hue of the stone tad wath thesurrounding landscape
it is also behoved that no house in the king dom erected at so early a date remains so perfectly entire as this
the elevation possesses perfect unity of design and execution in whichthe chaste and vigorous feeling characteristic of the elizabethan period is remarkably prevalent
the windows of the upper story which givehght to the long gallery are square headed and mullioned and are44 elizabethan architecture admirably proportioned to the spaces between the ionic pilasters hereintroduced to relieve the plainness of the surface
the entablaturecharged with arabesque ornament is surmounted by an elegantlypierced paraj^et at the height of fifty feet from the ground
hatfield plouse forms one of the subjects in mr. robinson 's vitruvius britannicus but the details now shown are not given in that valuablework amongst the illustrations is however a most beautiful view of thegallery to which these windows belong the length of this galleryis one hundred and sixty three feet but notwithstanding its extremelength and richness of architectural character the eng ravino- is finishedwith accuracy while the general peculiarity of effect is at the sametime admirably preserved
