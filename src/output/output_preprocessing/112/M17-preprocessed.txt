interview tomm moore talks the secret of kells’written by kristy puchko on october 5 2010
the secret of kells is an independent animated film out of ireland that broke into the us as a surprise pick for the 2009 academy awards beating out hayao miyazaki ’s ponyo for a best animated feature film nod
the film may have been the underdog going up against pixar ’s up henry selick ’s coraline disney ’s princess and the frog and wes anderson ’s fantastic mr. fox but first time director tomm moore was just happy to be on the ride
the oscar race drew tons of attention to the masterfully crafted and lushly designed animation culled from irish tradition and celtic aesthetics
and now moore is in new york city to promote the secret of kells dvd and digital comic during the ny comic con and i had the chance to speak with moore about his groundbreaking debut feature and what else he has in store
the look of the secret of kells is both eclectic and inventive
can you tell us about your inspirations for the film tm the main inspiration of course is the book of kells itself which is a national treasure in ireland and kind of one of the high points of medieval art
so we looked at that a lot and we looked at other medieval art from around that time but we were also inspired by comics like bone and calvin and hobbes
especially bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes paintings but also the painter gustav klimt and alphonse mucha
you know the kind of poster artists of the art nouveau period
and then there ’s a really great animated feature that was never finished called the thief and the cobbler by richard williams who was the animation director on who framed roger rabbit
and then genndy tartakovsky the guy who did samurai jack
oh i can see that
tm
yeah
we kind of oddly were inspired by the look of samurai jack but also how he was able to get such a cinematic look out of the budget for tv animation we thought that that was pretty clever because we were working under similar confines but also the look of eastern european animation especially from hungary we actually worked with a studio in hungary on the animation and that was great
then there ’s movies like ivan the terrible and german expressionism influenced some of the ways we try to use the shadows to kind of show what ’s going on in the characters lives or how they are actually behaving themselves
stuff like that
your film blended so many styles it was really fascinating to watch
tm we were able to show there is stuff you can do with drawings that you ca n’t do with realism art
that ’s the thing with cg animation it tends just to mimic live action filmmaking but with cartoon characters whereas animation can have its own language that ’s different to live action filmmaking
i think 2d animation in particular has a whole other graphic tradition that goes back further than film that it can draw from
like your use of triptychs in the secret of kells
tm exactly it functions almost as a split screen or a comic book but it goes back a lot further
i was up at the cloisters here in new york over the weekend and there are some beautiful triptychs up there
i was very shocked to see so much medieval art in new york
it does tend to get overshadowed by the shininess of times square
is this your first time in new york tm
no i was here just after the oscars
we had a kind of a release around st. patrick ’s day but this is my first time actually getting to see a bit of ny so it ’s great
and then i ’ll be spending the weekend at comic con and that ’ll be fun too
i guess i ’ll have to restrain myself from buying too many comics
i ’m a bit of an addict
i ’ve already spent quite a bit of money on comics and i have n’t gotten to comic con yet
the secret of kells has a strong focus on the importance of storytelling specifically visual storytelling
some have tied this theme to an argument for the value of hand drawn animation in a world that ’s leaning more and more on computer generated animation
what are your thoughts
tm some of the cgi that ’s getting made i mean i really love
but as a medium it has so much more that it can do than just realism
i think that there ’s the potential with cg to do some really interesting things that we have n’t seen yet
but just for me particularly for this film because it ’s about artists creating something by hand 2d animation seemed the right medium
plus that ’s the kind of animation i prefer to do and i prefer to watch
that ’s the kind of project i ’d always seek out i suppose
2d animation is in kind of a good place now because it ’s become something kind of different like stop motion it ’s not the main way that animation is done anymore
so now whenever a project is done in 2d it ’s kind of special
it looks different from everything else which i think is a good thing for 2d. because that means it ’s coming back to being more of an artistic choice rather than a business choice
in a cast full of colorful characters it ’s hard to pick a favorite
but personally i loved aisling
how was her character developed
tm aisling is based on my younger sister when we were that age
originally when we had the idea for the secret of kells i mean you ’re making a movie based on the creation of the book of kells it ’s made in a monastery you do n’t want it to become like a submarine movie
so i wanted to have some female element in it
which is obviously very strong in the irish catholic celtic christianity heritage
cause there ’s such an adoration of the goddess and that turned into an adoration of the virgin mary of course
but there ’s a very strong tradition in the celtic revival poems they are called aisling poems because aisling means dream or vision in gaelic tm cont
the poet would fall asleep and he ’d dream about ireland coming to talk to him in the form of this beautiful woman
and of course that ’s all very solemn and very lord of the rings
so we kind of turned that on it ’s head a bit by making her a little girl and tried to get the dynamic of an older brother and a younger sister rather than the very formal kind of matriarchal kind of idea
but she does represent that kind of goddess figure that kind of older belief system that preceded christianity growing up in that culture there ’s a very peculiar type of catholicism in ireland especially in rural ireland where you ’ve got a lot of old pagan beliefs and ideas about fairies and stuff mingled in with catholicism
so it ’s interesting to me that the old faith and the new faith have mingled in ireland but there ’s a universal truth in the stuff i think that ’s what ’s interesting for me
for the film we were kind of encouraged to keep it quite universal and not get too specific about catholicism and i think that was probably the right move because it kind of opened up the idea
where people may have been turned off if they thought there was some kind of overtly catholic or christian allegory which it ’s not
it is intended to be universal
you ’ve blogged about the development of the secret of kells in the early stages of the film ’s production
then the film ’s oscar campaign relied heavily on viral advertising
how do you feel the blogosphere is influencing the movie business
tm i ’m not sure
i started doing the blog almost naively
almost like a personal kind of diary
i was kind of thinking people like me might be interested in it
i just wanted to make it for anyone who might be interested in the process of it
so that ’s how we started doing the blog but then over time it almost became a marketing tool and we started building a bit of a following amongst the animation community
and they helped spread the word i think
i thought that was a big part of what helped the broader publicity is that we had so much support in the blogosphere i also look on the blogs and twitter and everywhere to get a broader opinion on a film aside from say just critics or general publicity
you know
it ’s a way to look around the curtain and see what everyone else is saying before you actually go and see a film
what was your favorite animated film when you were a kid tm i remember really liking disney ’s robin hood and the don bluth movies and all those kinds of cartoons
you know stuff that was kind of accessible to me
especially in ireland because don bluth had a studio in dublin
i remember there was excitement everytime another movie came out because there would be promotions and stuff in our town with people dressed up as the characters and stuff
the idea that animation on that level was being made in ireland kind of made it seem more accessible
i like secret of nimh and all those early ones
as an adult is there another animated feature that really stands out for you personally tm my neighbor totoro from hayao miyazaki
it ’s probably like my favorite animated feature
that ’s one that i ’d love to make that kind of film eventually
that ’s intense you beat him out for the oscar nomination
tm chuckles that was pretty weird
i do n’t think about that too much
i really loved ponyo by the way
it was cool
i remember i was wearing a totoro hoodie at one of the oscar parties and someone say hey that ’s the competition
i was like wow i can never think of him as the competition
it was fun you know
it was n’t something i particularly expected so it was a bit of a whirlwind i remember the night before the nominations my wife said oh do you think there ’s a chance the secret of kells will be nominated
and i was like not a chance at all
i knew we were in the running but i did n’t think we ’d be there at all it was pretty surreal
the secret of kells comes out on dvd october 4 in the us
what special features will fans get to see on the dvd tm it was really nice to do such a lush job on the dvd here in the states in ireland we did n’t have as many features and in france i ’m not a particularly good french speaker
so i did n’t do a commentary just an interview that they ’d have to translate
but the commentary on the us version has got myself and my co director nora twomey and the art director ross stewart
there ’s also a whole director ’s presentation that i did showing some of the earliest designs from ten years ago all the way up to how they look in the movie the other thing that ’s kind of cool is that ten years ago when i finished college we made a kind of concept trailer for the project as it was going to be at the time
it was called rebel at the time and that ’s on there
that trailer has three minutes of really old ten year old animation
you can see a kind of different and anti similar version of the finished project
so it ’s cool to be able to present all that on the dvd here in the states
and then there ’s a prequel graphic novel
tm it ’s great you can get a little tiny prequel in the blu ray box
but also you can see the artwork a bit larger if you want to download it from comixology
and then you get can a look of it on an i pod or your computer screen or your i phone or whatever
so that ’s kind of cool
and at comic con in new york over the weekend we ’re going to do a presentation on it which is pretty exciting too the thing is with the comics for the secret of kells is it was an opportunity to tell more of the story like a little bit of the background for the characters
stuff that we could n’t squeeze into the movie
previously you ’ve illustrated two comics about the early life of st. patrick an sclábhaí and an teachtaire in gaelic
any chance they ’ll be translated for english speaking audiences
tm if enough people say that they want them i ’m sure we could find a way
i ’ve been thinking about it actually because this new format the comixology format where you can see the stuff on your i pod makes it much easier to distribute comics
you do n’t have to go through all the printing costs and everything
so hopefully there ’d be a way to get those
i ’ll be keeping an eye out for that
what can you tell us about your next feature song of the sea tm song of the sea is kind of a film that ’s grown out of some of the research and
stuff i was doing on the legends of irish history and all
it brought up a kind of melancholy feeling in me the sense of this stuff being lost in a modern world
so the song of the sea is about the last little selkie girl
she ’s a little child who can transform from a child into a seal it ’s based on an old scottish irish legend
and she ’s the last one
and she ’s trying to find her way back to the sea with her brother
and along the way they discover all the creatures from irish folklore that are disappearing or blending into the landscape
so it ’s a story about a kid on a journey but also a bit about the way old things are sort of fading in a modern world hopefully it wo n’t take as long to get finished as the secret of kells
thank you so much for your time tomm
do you have any words for aspiring animators
tm you learn patience and persistence when learning to be an animator you know
so that ’s all there really is to say
just keep going
just keep at it
it you have an idea or a vision to do something just keep at it
just keep at it and you ’ll get there
the secret of kells is now available on blu ray and dvd and is also available on netflix instant watch
