introductionone of the great masterpieces in the history of irish art and a world famous example of early christian art the book of kells leabhar cheanannais is the most famous of the illuminated manuscripts produced by irish monks about 800 ce also known as the book of columba or the gospel of colum cille the book of kells includes the four gospels of the new testament written in latin decorated with innumerable illuminations illustrations and miniature images in a blaze of colour
although unfinished it is a wonderful example of medieval christian art and one of the best surviving examples of the hiberno saxon style or insular art
it is on permanent display at trinity college dublin library in ireland
the name book of kells comes from the abbey of kells in county meath ireland where it was preserved during medieval times
when was the book of kells written where was it written and who was the author of the manuscript
these questions remain the subject of considerable debate among scholars of monastic irish art and there are a number of theories
according to the most widely accepted explanation the book of kells was created at the monastery in iona and illuminated by at least four different artist monks whose names are lost to history
other art scholars have suggested that the manuscript may have been produced at lindisfarne holy island off the coast of northumberland then moved to iona and thence to kells
or lastly it may have been produced at an unidentified scottish monastery
note
for the world 's earliest known illuminated gospel text please see the garima gospels 390 660 from ethiopia origins and history of the book of kells the greatest achievement of irish medieval art the book of kells was formerly held to be earlier than the lindisfarne gospels which are dated approximately from 700 ce but is now generally assigned to the late eighth or early ninth century
it can only have been made in one of two places iona or kells
it seems probable though that due to its resemblances to the lindisfarne gospels it was at least begun at iona a traditional centre of holy learning and illumination from where saint columba launched his mission to christianize scotland and where he was later buried the base from which lindisfarne had been colonized about the year 635
unfortunately vikings frequently raided the island burning the monastery and killing the monks
in 804 after two viking raids the monks of iona fled from their exposed island monastery to meath in ireland
they obtained a grant of land at cenannus kells and established there the metropolis of the columban order
but they regretted abandoning iona and made various attempts to resettle there carrying with them the sacred objects and books of the monastery
finally in 849 all were brought back to kells the great manuscript probably with them
that the manuscript was at kells two centuries later we know from an entry in the annals of ulster 1007
and as it is hardly probable that such a work should have been begun during the troubled years between 804 and 849 and since most of its decorative art points to a date within the eighth century it is reasonable to assume that an important part of it had been produced in the scriptorium of iona before the viking raids drove the monks to meath
in any case the most probable date of the book of kells is between 760 804 and 815 20 and it is likely that different painters were working at it for several years
again in view of a. m. friend 's evidence that in its canon tables and evangelist portraits it has borrowed motifs from the continental ada group these elements must be dated at the earliest about the close of the eighth century
the removal of the book of kells along with the relics of saint columba to the irish mainland failed to secure its safety
in 1007 it was seized by vikings who plundered its jewelled cover
it was later unearthed in a ditch miraculously intact with only a few sections missing
after the surrender of the monastery of kells to the crown by abbot richard plunket in 1539 the manuscript passed into the hands of one geralde plunket of dublin possibly a relative of the abbot and from plunket to james ussher a highly versatile and accomplished scholar of the day and one of the earliest students of trinity college dublin
finally the manuscript passed with ussher 's library to trinity college where it is today
who wrote the book of kells scribes illustrators
at the beginning of the eleventh century the book belonged to the church of kells and was called the great gospel of colum cille
 this was supposed to be because the book was written and illuminated during the time of saint columba saint columcille c.521 97 perhaps even by columba himself
however when it is said that the book of kells may have been written by columba it is not meant that he was also the artist from whose pen the elaborate ornamentation of the volume proceeded
columba was reputed to have been a most industrious indeed almost fanatical scribe
but the scribe and the illuminator were seldom the same person
the illuminations were frequently executed much later than the manuscript itself and the original plan of the book of kells was apparently so vast that it could not be completed in a short time
the spaces to be decorated were left blank by the scribe
several painters possibly at different periods were employed to fill them there are indeed still to be seen some pages where the ornaments of the framework are unfinished being only partially sketched in outline
furthermore it is highly unlikely that columba even wrote the script since paleographic research shows that the style of latin script used did not emerge until well after his death
in response some experts in irish art consider it may have been created in 797 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of saint columba 's death
four illuminators or artists the scholar francoise henry believes that among the several artists who may have worked on the illumination at different periods four are readily identifiable on stylistic grounds
one artist she feels was obviously entrusted with the cruciform cover page known as the page of the eight circles the great chi rho and the initial page of each of the gospels except the quoniam
she sees in him the goldsmith someone familiar with work in precious metals in enamel and in niello
the delicacy of his work is impressive as is his interest in asymmetry
francoise henry recognizes another individualist in the portraitist of the three evangelists the page composed of square frames and the quoniam at the beginning of the gospel of saint luke
the third is the illustrator the author of the virgin and child the tunc crucifixerat and the temptation
finally a fourth artist is responsible for many less important contributions

how the book of kells compares with other manuscripts the script employed in the book of kells is the beautiful round uncial of all the best irish manuscripts
it differs little in that feature from the book of durrow
but here their similarities cease
the scale of the book of kells is different from that of the book of durrow and the mood of its expression is vastly different the calm meticulous distinction of the earlier book gives way to a flamboyant magnificent exuberance there is nothing of that constrained perfection of order and organization inherited from the cathach of saint columba c.610 20 which mark both the book of durrow and the lindisfarne gospels
no manuscript we have seen before approaches the book of kells for elaborate ornamentation
each of the gospels was prefaced with three pages of full length decoration a depiction of the evangelists symbol a portrait of the evangelist himself and an initial page
in addition there were extra pages of decoration at two key passages in the text the incarnation of christ and the crucifixion
last and most unusual of all a series of narrative illustrations were planned three of which have survived
in addition the cover pages have a cruciform composition followed by a series of porticos framing the canon tables
the carpet pages of pure ornament of the book of durrow are replaced in the book of kells by cruciform pages bearing the symbols of the evangelists and the same symbols disposed in various ways over and under the arcades give the canon tables a fantastic appearance
the chi rho introducing the genealogy of christ in saint matthew is ornamented as richly as the initial pages of the gospels
a continuous chain of ornamentation runs through the text
the capitals at the beginning of each paragraph two three four to a page are made of brightly coloured entwinements of birds snakes distorted men and quadrupeds fighting or performing all sorts of acrobatic feats
other animals wander about the pages between the lines or on top of them
in addition one of the most striking and unusual features of the book of kells is this profusion of animated capitals a feature of irish illumination which may owe its origin to the ornamented letters ending in coiled celtic spirals in the book of durrow
eastern influence on the design of the book of kells oriental and particularly coptic influence is generally recognized throughout the book of kells coptic clearly in the group of red dots on the robes of the evangelists mark and john
furthermore the figure of the virgin and child seated on a throne surrounded by attending angels appears frequently in coptic art
francoise henry points out a striking analogy between the the virgin and child page and a ninth century coptic manuscript in the pierpont morgan library in new york catalogue of the manuscripts of the pierpont morgan collection
it is true that the coptic manuscripts are all so far as is known later than the irish
but coptic manuscripts of the ninth to the fourteenth centuries were evidently based on a well established ancient tradition originating in the sixth or even the fifth century
this assumption is supported by an early coptic binding with a decorative arrangement of broad ribbons and crosses which suggest the existence in the sixth century of full pages of ribbon interlacing
the later coptic manuscripts which we know probably embody many archaic elements
but it would appear that there must have been a direct connexion between early irish christianity and the tradition of byzantine art decoration seen in the monasteries of egypt as well as the highly orientalized greek christianity of the south east mediterranean
illuminations in the book of kells for all the wealth and variety irish manuscript illumination has to offer it is the book of kells that is generally recognized as the supreme achievement in this field
symbols of the evangelists the emphasis placed on the evangelists symbols was unprecedented
in addition to the traditional symbol pages at the start of the gospels they featured in the canon tables the portraits and other prefatory sections
they were also used in a number of different ways sometimes as ornamental motifs sometimes as heraldic beasts and sometimes as potent talismans
as such they underwent a variety of transformations
in one instance a peacock 's tail becomes attached to a lion 's head while in another the eagle of st john holds the gospel in a human hand
only two of the portraits have survived providing one of the weaker aspects of the decoration but the four initial pages are superb
in each case the first letter runs the full length of the page and the words themselves are completely indecipherable to the untutored eye
instead the calligraphy becomes a pretext for a dazzling display of spiral and interlace patterns from la tene celtic art designs
it also offers the artist an opportunity to exercise his imagination to the full
on the st john 's page for example the letters c and i are transformed into a man playing a harp while on the st luke 's page the characters iam merge together to become an instrument of torture
monogram page chi ro and others the decoration on the pages which mark the incarnation of christ is even more spectacular
the format of the monogram page is similar to the examples in the lindisfarne and lichfield manuscripts but the sheer profusion of detail is astonishing
hidden away among the loops and spirals there are vignettes of cats and mice fighting over a communion wafer an otter clutching a fish and a row of angels displaying the gospels
in most other manuscripts the monogram page provides the sole decoration at this point but in the book of kells the incarnation passage is commemorated with two other illustrations
there is a splendid carpet page the only one in the kells manuscript and a portrait of christ
the latter was a great rarity in insular manuscripts as was the notion of adding decoration to the crucifixion passage
sadly this is one of the sections of the book that was never completed
there is an ornamental initial page but this faces a blank sheet where doubtless a depiction of the crucifixion was planned
the narrative illustrations hint at a new figurative direction in celtic art
with their preference for abstract or stylized forms celtic craftsmen usually shied away from themes of this kind and only a few isolated examples can be found in the earlier gospel books
here there are three and it seems likely that the complete manuscript would have included several more
the surviving illustrations depict the temptation of christ the arrest and the virgin and child
the latter is particularly interesting partly because it is the earliest known version of this subject in an insular manuscript and partly because it demonstrates the hesitancy of an artist working in an unfamiliar genre
the figures of the virgin the infant christ and the attendant angels were probably borrowed from an eastern icon but they sit uneasily beside the more obviously celtic elements the writhing beasts in the border the beard tuggers in the semicircular insets and the savage head on the back of the virgin 's throne
celtic style designwork for the origins and history of celtic designs the evolution of motifs such as celtic interlace designs zoomorphic patterns and symbols including celtic knots and celtic crosses all part of the heritage of the ancient celts see celtic culture
legacythere is no question but that the book of kells is ireland 's finest example of biblical art and its richest illuminated manuscript in graphic invention colour and fantasy
nevertheless its overpowering brilliance should not blind us to the quiet distinction elegant restraint and sensibility of its earlier cousin the book of durrow
both have their place one in a sense the high point of controlled beauty almost an artistic understatement the other a sumptuous baroque conflagration with nevertheless a tight architectural structure
and both share those peculiar characteristics that set them apart from the illuminated work of other cultures and other areas and which curiously relate them in spirit to the visual approach and the visual appetites of the exploring artists of the present period in the twentieth century a thousand years and more since the dates of their production
other irish illuminated gospel books the book of kells is one of a number of illuminated books created by irish artists in monastries in ireland scotland and england
