the book of kells
the book of kells is referred to in the annals of ulster as being the chief relic of the western world
 it contains 678 illustrated calf skin or vellum pages with the last two being without illustration
the major part of the book was probably written in the columban monastery 's scriptorum on the island of iona in scotland and was coloured using natural dyes made by the monks
the ink has not faded in 1000 years
there is a lot of nonsense talked about the four symbols that are used in the book of kells:- lion man calf and eagle
most historians say that they are supposed to represent the four apostles
they do not represent the apostles but represent the twelve tribes of israel to whom the apostles were sent by christ
the four symbols are the four brigade emblems of the twelve tribes of israel who camped around the tabernacle in the wilderness during their forty year punishment and wandering in the wilderness under moses
the encampment was square with three tribes camped on each of the four sides
the centre tribe of the three on each side was the brigade leader so their standard was the dominant one on each of the four sides
those four tribes were judah reuben joseph ephraim and dan
judah 's standard is a lion reuben 's standard is a man joseph ephraim 's standard is a wild ox calf which today has become a unicorn and dan 's standard is an eagle
the irish people are mostly descended from dan and came to ireland at various times under various names as they migrated by different routes and arrived at different times having picked up new names along the way
one of those names makes their identity more obvious than the others and that name is the tuatha de danaan the tribe of dan who was the fifth of jacob israel 's twelve sons
jacob israel 's twelve sons fathered the twelve tribes of israel
prior to the de danaans were the nemidhians sons of heaven who came from carthage which was a phoenician danite settlement or sanctuary nemidh in what is now tunisia
the phoenician sailors of ancient history were mostly israelites from the tribes of dan gad and simeon
phoenicia was a region not a country just as europe is a region and not a country
after the tuatha de danaans came to ireland there were at various times further immigrations of danites under the name milesians sons of mil who was a danite warrior from which the name milesian later came to mean warrior and of course later still as dan ish vikings and norsemen
the eagle is the tribal standard or ensign emblem of dan and the danites discovered america in the b.c. era and again as vikings eric the red leif ericsson etc long before columbus and later helped to populate it as irish immigrants which is why there is dan 's eagle holding the olive and arrows of joseph their brother joseph 's secondary emblems on the american coat of arms

tradegoods from ancient carthage have been found in various locations in north america as recorded in a book written by an eminent harvard university professor called barry fell
the four tribal standards previously mentioned as being on the pages of the famous book of kells are also mentioned by christ to his apostle john in christ 's apocalypse revelation
revelation apocalypse 4:6
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind
4:7
and the first beast was like a lion judah and the second beast like a calf ephraim and the third beast had a face as a man reuben and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle dan 4:8
and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him three tribes each tribe with two wings and
they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come
4:9 and when those four beasts 12 tribes give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever,4:10 the four and twenty elders the prophets fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying,4:11 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
jesus told his disciples and the writers of the four gospels:- matthew mark luke and john to go to the lost sheep of the house of israel the ten lost tribes scattered abroad and to make disciples of all nations
james the lord 's brother later wrote to all twelve tribes after the final dispersion of the remnant of the remaining two tribes by the romans in his letter in the new testament
the four emblems represent the tribes of israel to whom the gospels were to be preached and that is why they are quite rightly on the pages of the book of kells in ireland because the irish are israelites as i have previously explained

james 1:1 james a servant of god and of the lord christ jesus to the twelve tribes of israel which are scattered abroad greetings
