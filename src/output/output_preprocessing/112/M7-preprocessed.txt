book of kells2
the book of kells is not simply a religious manuscript
true it contains the four gospels of mark mathew luke and john and that was the sole original purpose of the book
but its age and its design although damaged allow us a glorious glimpse into the art and style of ancient ireland
the book is quite simply considered a crowning glory of the celtic art form and possibly one of the most important treasures of western europe 3
experts are uncertain where the book of kells was first begun but evidence points to the isle of iona which was the center of st. columba 's influence and the home of his church
later during the viking raids of the 9th century it was moved for its protection to kells monastery county meath ireland
here it remained for almost two hundred years until it was stolen in 1007
its golden cover which was probably encrusted with gems was ripped from the book and the remainder was thrown in a ditch
the book was soon recovered but not before it received some water damage to the front and back pages
unfortunately its cover was forever lost
4 the book of kells remained in the monastery at kells until 1541 when the roman catholic church took it for protection
in 1661 it was returned to ireland and given to trinity college of dublin by archbishop ussher
it has remained at the college since then and is the most important work that the university library contains 5
over the years approximately 30 of its pages have been lost the remaining 340 contains the four gospels a list of hebrew names and the eusebian cannons
but these are not the hallmarks of the book as it is the artwork contained on the remaining leaves of calfskin pages that are its major achievement 6
the book is resplendent with artwork covering almost all the styles known at the time
it is estimated that this artwork took a team of illustrators thirty years to complete
all of it meticulously done by hand and in amazing intricacy and color
the most resplendent of the pages open the four chapters with illustrations of the saints along with individual pages that depict events in the life of christ 7
the detail in the book of kells is amazing with no one symbol duplicated elsewhere in the book
in one spot there are over 158 lacings of a white ribbon contained in a square inch and nowhere can there be found an error by the artist even after searching with a magnifying glass
it is no wonder that for many years it was believed that only angels could only have written the book of kells
