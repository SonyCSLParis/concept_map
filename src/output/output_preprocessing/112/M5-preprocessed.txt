about the book of kellsmost famous illuminated manuscript also known as the book of columba
ornately illustrated manuscript produced by celtic monks around ad 800 in the style known as insular art
the name book of kells is derived from the abbey of kells in kells county meath in ireland where it was kept for much of the medieval period
the date and place of production of the manuscript has been the subject of considerable debate
traditionally the book was thought to have been created in the time of columba also known as st columcille possibly even as the work of his own hands
however it is now generally accepted that this tradition is false based on palaeographic grounds the style of script in which the book is written did not develop until well after columba 's death making it impossible for him to have written it
evidence shows the book of kells was written around the year 800 ad.there is another tradition which has some traction among irish scholars which suggests that it was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint 's death
the manuscript was never finished
there are at least five competing theories about the manuscript 's place of origin and time of completion
first the book may have been created entirely at iona then brought to kells and never finished
second the book may have been begun at iona and continued at kells but never finished
third the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at kells
fourth it may have been produced in the north of england perhaps at lindisfarne then brought to iona and from there to kells
finally it may have been the product of an unknown monastery in scotland
although the question of the exact location of the book 's production will probably never be answered conclusively the second theory that it was begun at iona and finished at kells is currently the most widely accepted
regardless of which theory is true it is certain that the book of kells was produced by columban monks closely associated with the community at iona
the book of kells contains the four gospels of the christian scriptures written in black red purple and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script preceded by prefaces summaries and concordances of gospel passages
today it consists of 340 folios
it is believed that some 30 folios have been lost
when the book was examined by ussher in 1621 he counted 344 folios
the extant folios are gathered into 38 quires
there are between four and twelve folios per quire two to six bifolios
ten folios per quire is common
some folios are single sheets
the important decorated pages often occurred on single sheets
the folios had lines drawn for the text sometimes on both sides after the bifolia were folded
prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages
the vellum is of high quality although the folios have an uneven thickness with some being almost leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent
the book 's current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm
originally the folios were not of standard size but they were cropped to the current standard size during an 18th century rebinding
the text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm
each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text
the manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing etc
the book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years but was apparently never finished the projected decoration of some of the pages appearing only in outline
the book as it exists now contains preliminary matter the complete text of the gospels of matthew mark and luke and the gospel of john through john 17:13
the remainder of john and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen in the early 11th century
the extant preliminary matter consists of two fragments of lists of hebrew names contained in the gospels the breves causae and the argumenta of the four gospels and the eusebian canon tables
the book of kells contains the text of the four gospels based on the vulgate
it does not however contain a pure copy of the vulgate
there are numerous variants from the vulgate where old latin translations are used rather than jerome 's text
although these variants are common in all of the insular gospels there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts
it is thought that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar
folio 309r contains text from the gospel of john written in insular majuscule by the scribe known as hand b
folio 309r contains text from the gospel of john written in insular majuscule by the scribe known as hand b
the manuscript is written in insular majuscule with some minuscule letters usually c and s
the text is usually written in one long line across the page
fran√ßoise henry identified at least three scribes in this manuscript whom she named hand a hand b and hand c. hand a is found on folios 1 through 19v folios 276 through 289 and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript
hand a for the most part writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall ink common throughout the west
hand b is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128
hand b has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page
hand c is found throughout the majority of the text
hand c also has greater tendency to use minuscule than hand a. hand c uses the same brownish gall ink used by hand a and wrote almost always seventeen lines per page
the text is accompanied by incredibly intricate full pages of artwork with smaller painted decorations appearing throughout the text itself
the book has a broad palette of colours with purple lilac red pink green and yellow being the colours most often used
the illustrations in the book of durrow by contrast use only four colours
surprisingly given the lavish nature of the work there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript
the pigments used for the illustrations had to be imported from all over europe
the lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving insular gospel book
there are ten surviving full page illuminations including two evangelist portraits three pages with the four evangelist symbols a carpet page a miniature of the virgin and child a miniature of christ enthroned and miniatures of the arrest of jesus and the temptation of christ
there are 13 surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the gospels
there are many pages where only some of the text on the page is decorated
eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration
it is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost
in addition to these major pages there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials scattered throughout the text
the extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of hebrew names
this fragment occupies one column of folio 1 recto
the other column of the folio is occupied by a miniature of the four evangelist symbols now much abraded
the miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees in order to view it properly
the four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book
they are almost always shown together so that the doctrine of unity of message of the four gospels is emphasised
