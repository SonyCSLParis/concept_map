old library and the book of kells trinity ’s most compelling tourist attraction is the book of kells kept in the eighteenth century old library on fellows square
on the library ’s ground floor beautiful pages are displayed not just from the book of kells around 800 ad but from other works such as the book of armagh early ninth century and the book of mulling late eighth century
the books themselves are preceded by a fascinating exhibition turning darkness into light which sets irish illuminated manuscripts in context ranging from ogham the earlier celtic writing system of lines carved on standing stones to ethiopian books of devotions pre eminent for the scale variety and colour of its decoration the book of kells probably originated at the monastery on iona off the west coast of scotland which had been founded around 561 by the great irish scholar bard and ruler st colmcille st columba in english
after a viking raid in 806 the columbines moved to the monastery of kells in county meath which in its turn was raided four times between 920 and 1019
although they looted the book ’s cumdach or metal shrine cover the pagan norsemen did not value the book itself however and despite spending some time buried underground and losing thirty folios it survived at kells up to the seventeenth century when it was taken to dublin for safekeeping during the cromwellian wars
the 340 calfskin folios of the book of kells contain the four new testament gospels along with preliminary texts all in latin
it ’s thought that three artists created the book ’s lavish decoration which shows pictish germanic and mediterranean as well as celtic influences
not only are there full page illustrations of christ and the virgin and child but an elaborate decorative scheme of animals and spiral roundel and interlace patterns is employed throughout the text on the initials at the beginning of each gospel and on full length carpet pages
upstairs is the library ’s magnificent long room built by thomas burgh between 1712 and 1732 and enlarged with a barrel vaulted ceiling in 1860
as a copyright library trinity has had the right to claim a free copy of all british and irish publications since 1801 of its current stock of four million titles 200,000 of the oldest are stored in the long room ’s oak bookcases
besides interesting temporary exhibitions of books and prints from the library ’s collection the long room also displays a gnarled fifteenth century harp the oldest to survive from ireland and a rare original printing of the 1916 proclamation of the irish republic made on easter sunday in dublin ’s liberty hall
