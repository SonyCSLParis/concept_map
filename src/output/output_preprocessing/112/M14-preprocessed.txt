the book of kells at trinity college dublinby christa thompson december 17 2013 tweetshareireland ’s finest national treasure during my recent visit to dublin ireland i was able to make my way over to the old library at trinity college home to the book of kells exhibit
making its way from a scriptorium of the monastery founded near 561 by st. colum cille on iona just off the western coast of scotland the book of kells has become widely known as the most stunning elaborate and lavish work of insular illumination in history
made ca 800 or even earlier by celtic monks is an illuminated manuscript written in latin that contains the four gospels of the new testament
mainly based on the vulgate it also contains passages from early versions of the bible the vetus latina
its extravagant illustrations and ornate details surmounts other insular gospel books
it ’s manuscript ’s pages are decorated in great detail depicting humans animals and mythological beasts
bordered with celtic knots and vibrant patterns the imagery in the book of kells is infused with christian symbolism
book of kells facts it attracts over 500,000 visitors annually
manuscript has 340 folios
written on calf vellum
lettering is in iron gall ink
colors imported from far away lands many made from plant and animal pigments
named after the abbey of kells in co meath where it lived for centuries
the entire manuscript can be viewed on the library ’s digital collections portal
the manuscript was never finished
the fairytale traveler experience at the book of kells the entire first floor of the book of kells exhibit is set up nicely as a self guided tour through blown up illuminated replicas of the manuscript
i strongly advise you spending the 5 euro to get the audio mp3 player with headphones that you keep
well worth the extra cheddar
you ’re not allowed to photograph the exhibit downstairs so best i can explain is it ’s stunning well laid out and easy to work through
it is guided by numbers leading to the back where there are 2 displays of actual manuscripts that they rotate out
the ornate details are surreal and quite honestly mind boggling
upstairs in one of the most beautifully crafted libraries in the world dating back to the 18th century is the long room
the long room houses 200,000 of the library ’s oldest books in its oak bookcases
it also boasts a small display for bram stoker with a first edition copy of the famous gothic novel dracula
