nirvanaas i walked through the front gates of the monastery my breath was taken away
a monk was waiting for us in front of five beautiful stone statues which were displayed in a bank of water
the monk beckoned us to a white building
before entering we removed our shoes and walked into a bright carpeted room
on the floor were seven orange cushions that faced a large gold buddha
the monk introduced himself before giving us a brief introduction to buddhism
he explained that there were two main kinds theravada and mahayana and that this monastery followed the teachings of theravada
there are 227 rules that the monks must follow in order to practice one example is that it is forbidden to have any sexual relations with women
he also said that the monks must study for one year at the monastery and that they must travel to impart their knowledge to other buddhists for one year
after giving us his introduction he allowed us to ask him some personal questions
some of the questions were 1 how often are you allowed to meet your family
every six months
2 what made you convert from catholicism to buddhism ten years ago i read a book on buddhism and ever since then i had been intrigued
the concepts made sense but i did n't understand how to put it into affect so i decided to learn more about it
3 how often do you eat twice a day- breakfast and dinner
4 who funds the monasteries
 lay people
once the introduction was over he gave us a tour of the monastery
he showed us structures that represented different stages in the buddha 's quest for enlightenment
there was a stone statue of a starving buddha and another of the buddha after he had found a balance
the monk explained that in order to attain enlightenment the buddha realized that he can not suffer by starving himself nor can he indulge in his desires by eating too much
the buddha had to find a balance between the two
he also he showed us the bodhi tree which was the tree under which the buddha found enlightenment and a flower from the tree under which the buddha was born
once the tour of the monastery was complete we returned back to the white building for our meditation session
while we were meditating the monk instructed us on where to focus our mind
he went through the different parts of the body while reminding us to pay attention to any other sensations
after our session the buddha offered us some general advice
but
the day was n't over yet
after visiting the monastery we visited borobudur temple which is a mahayana buddhist temple from the 9th century
certain parts of the temple had been buried for thousands of years due to the volcanic ashes
it was only in 1814 that it was re discovered
for a few years after that unesco and the indonesian government started a project to restore the temple
the temple was not too tall but it was extremely wide
there were four entrances that led to different levels which symbolized the different stages required to reach enlightenment
each level had stone carvings that illustrated stories
for example on the first level which is that of desire there were stories about gossip prostitution and alcohol
our tour guide took us to each level and explained some of the stories
at the top of the temple the view was stunning
it was interesting to learn about the same religion but in two different scenarios
the temple was quiet and serene whereas borobudur was a historic landsite that was bursting with people
overall it has been the best day so far
