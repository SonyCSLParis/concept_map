candi borobudur the largest buddhist monument in the world”5 of 5 stars reviewed august 4 2015 our taxi picked us up at 3.30 am we were going to borobudur the largest buddhist monument in the world
this was such an odd time to visit some place on a holiday but we were told that one must reach there for a stunning sunrise
this temple is often considered as one of the world ’s wonders sits on a hill top in the island of java
we were to reach manohara resort about 45 kilometres from our hotel in jogjakarta
entry fees were around 350,000 indonesian rupees per head
we were given a torch were asked to follow the guide
it was pitch dark had absolutely no idea about what was in store for us
we kept on walking climbing never ending big stairs
with 7 kg camera equipment on my back it was tough but cool early morning weather expectations of getting some phenomenal shots kept me going
reached the desired level after some very tough climbing heaved a sigh of relief that i could manage it
as the ambrosial hour passed things started becoming visible
whole structure was massive an architectural marvel
its sheer size evoked a sense of grandeur
it is an extraordinary structure with an equally amazing history
temple covers an enormous area overlooking the lush green rice plantation fields was built without using any cement mortar or glue
it is a massive interlocking stone blocks structure
this 9th century mahayana buddhist temple consists of nine stacked platforms six square three circular topped by a central dome is decorated with 2700 bas relief panels 504 buddha statues
little is known about the architect gundharma who designed it in the rein of sailendra dynasty
pilgrimage begins at the base of the structure ascends to the top through three levels of buddhist spirituality kamadhatu world of desire rupadhatu world of forms arupadhatu niraakaar or formlessness
each stage is represented by a higher stage of enlightenment
central dome is surrounded by 72 buddha statues inside the perforated stupas
it is designed in buddhist architecture with major influences of indian gupta art and indigenous indonesian traditional art
borobudur is simplified javanese pronunciation of vihara buddha uhr
a sanskrit word meaning the city of buddhas
borobudur was constructed around the same period as the shiva prambanan temple which is depicted by significant hindu structures in the temple
it is a legacy of culture coexisting powers shared harmony
buddha images dwarpals guards lions etc all indicate the mixed hindu buddhist influence
bas reliefs depict daily life in java hermits life of buddha kings queens apsaraas gods asuras figures of surasundari holding a lotus flora fauna
birth life of siddhartha is also depicted along with the mother maya father suddhodana
in 14th century temple was abandoned with the decline of hindu kingdoms javanese conversion to islam
it lay hidden for centuries under thick forest volcanic ash
it was discovered by british ruler of java in 1814 by sir thomas stamford
later the temple was also looted by the local officers rulers taking away artefacts buddha statues bas reliefs as trophies
many artefacts can now be seen in java museum even in the national museum of bangkok
monuments also suffered damages due to soft soil around it earthquakes volcanic eruptions
in 1991 unesco declared it as world heritage site
in 1985 it was damaged by bomb attacks of islamic terrorists 2006 earthquake 2010 mount merapi 27 kilometres from the temple volcanic eruptions also had its sadistic effect on this beautiful structure
temple is now well guarded because of threat by isis
at first all the buddha statues look same but there are small differences in asanas mudras
many statues are headless with the heads decorating museums private houses
as the sun rises all structures become more clear more fascinating
place can be very hot in the day time so it is best to visit early morning
temple is also used as a place for pilgrimage buddhist in indonesia come here every year celebrating vesak
it is one of the few sites where you feel lucky that you have visited seen photographed it
just like angkor vat prambanan you start feeling something special blessed
one starts to begin to feel the extent of which we humans are capable of doing with little or no knowledge
sunrise is stunning most amazing
most of the visitors were western tourist soaking in the spirituality of the place
i had a good time clicking few decent pictures
