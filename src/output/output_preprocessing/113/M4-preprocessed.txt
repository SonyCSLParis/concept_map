16 june 2014 12:26 dhwtythe magnificent ancient buddhist temple of borobudur(read the article on one page)indonesia is the country with the largest muslim population in the world
prior to the coming of islam however this archipelago was dominated by hinduism and buddhism
one of the most iconic monuments attesting to this pre islamic era is the borobudur temple compound in the kedu valley which is situated on the southern part of central java
the borobudur temple compound consists of three monuments namely the temple of borobudur and two smaller temples located on the east on a straight axis to the main temple
the main temple of borobudur itself is the largest buddhist temple in the world
this 60,000 m³ monument is 34.5 m high and has a square base of 123 m x 123 m. borobudur was built in three tiers
the base of this temple consists of a pyramid formed by five concentric square terraces
this is followed by the trunk of a cone with three platforms
on the very top is a monumental stupa a mound like structure containing buddhist relics
the walls and balustrades of borobudur are decorated with fine low reliefs depicting various buddhist scenes
this temple was built as a mahayana buddhist temple around the8th and 9 th century a.d. by the sailendra dynasty
this dynasty originated either from south india or indochina
their presence in java helped establish the island as a centre of buddhist scholarship and worship
this is evident in the fact that chinese coins and ceramics have been found at the site indicating that it pilgrims from as far away as china once visited this sacred site
in addition these artefacts suggest that borobudur was abandoned by the 16 th century a.d. this may be due to the fact that the arrival of islam on java during the 13 th and 14 th centuries a.d. shifted the centre of javan life to the eastern part of the island
nevertheless borobudur was left to decay on its own
over the next couple of centuries volcanic eruptions deposited ash on the site and borobudur was engulfed by the lush vegetation that grew out of the fertile volcanic ash
although borobudur was a largely forgotten site it would not remain so forever
in the early 19 th century sir thomas stamford raffles the british governor of java and the founder the city of singapore heard about borobudur and took an interest in it
hence an excavation was organised to uncover the temple
whilst this excavation brought borobudur back into the limelight it was had damaging effects on it
by exposing the temple to the elements the temple began to deteriorate further
furthermore stones were casually removed by villagers to be used as building materials while buddha heads and other treasures were removed by collectors to be sold to private and public collections around the world
in 1948 the plight of borobudur came to the attention of the newly formed republic of indonesia
as a result the preservation of this cultural heritage became a central priority of the government
two decades later the save borobudur campaign was launched through the indonesian government and unesco
this was one of the most ambitious international preservation projects ever attempted as the monument ’s lower terraces were completely dismantled so that each stone could be individually identified catalogued cleaned and treated for preservation
in addition the relief panels were also cleaned and treated to withstand the elements
furthermore an extensive drainage system was put in place behind the walls and under the floors of the galleries to reduce erosion
eight years and $ 25 million later the restoration of borobudur was finally completed
nevertheless conservation of this temple has to be continued over the years
for instance just several months ago borobudur was threatened by the eruption of mount kelud
in order to protect the temple some of the stupas were quickly covered in order to protect them from the volcanic ash
the fact that this incredible buddhist monument continues to be treasured and protected in a predominantly muslim country is testament to its significant value as a cultural and historical icon of indonesia
