borobudur is a buddhist stupa and temple complex in central java indonesia dating from the 8th century and a unesco world heritage site
this is one of world 's truly great ancient monuments the single largest buddhist structure anywhere on earth and few who visit fail to be taken by both the scale of place and the remarkable attention to detail that went into the construction
set as it is in the heart of the verdant kedu plain the backdrop of mighty active volcanoes only enhances the sense of awe and drama
understand[edit]history[edit]there is no definite written record of who built borobudur or why it was built
it was likely founded as a religious site in the 8th century at the peak of the sailendra dynasty in central java
the construction is thought to have taken a period of 75 years and completed in about 825 ad
the details of hinduism and buddhism from this period in java 's history can be baffling for visitors
together with the records of many royal marriages between hindu and buddhist nobles many hindu and buddhist monuments were constructed in the region at this time
borobudur and the nearby hindu prambanan temple complex were more or less contemporaneous
a common thread of stories suggest that borobudur lay abandoned and hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and thick jungle growth
popular theories are that the local population just became disinterested when there were mass conversions to islam in the 15th century or they were simply driven away by a large volcanic eruption
it was never forgotten entirely though with local folklore ensuring that stories of the great monument lived on
rediscoveryfollowing the anglo dutch java war java was briefly under british administration from 1811 to 1816
the british governor was thomas stamford raffles the founder of singapore and he took a great practical and academic interest in the history of the mystical island of java
on a tour to semarang in 1814 he was informed about a huge lost monument deep in the jungles near yogyakarta and he sent a dutch engineer to investigate
it took two months to clear the jungle and partially reveal the amazing monument but it was not until 1885 that the complex was unearthed in its magnificent entirety
raffles also presided over the re discovery of nearby prambanan and it is somewhat ironic that the very brief british rule of java led to the uncovering of both these ancient monuments
appreciation and protection was surprisingly slow to develop and borobudur became the domain of unscrupulous souvenir hunters
modern day archaeologists speculate that this was due to the european obsession with ancient egypt at the time borobudur was just too remote and too far away to get the attention it undoubtedly deserved
there was even a dutch proposal to dismantle the monument and scatter it piece by piece to museums around the world
thankfully good sense prevailed and by the end of the 19th century the site was left largely intact and as importantly extensively photographed and a five year restoration programme was undertaken in 1907
modern day borobudur
in 1956 unesco began an assessment process for the full scale restoration of the monument
finally in 1968 a major plan to restore borobudur was created and this huge project involved a complete overhaul of the monument up until 1983
the unsteady foundations were stabilized everything was meticulously cleaned and a major drainage system installed
after the works were finished unesco formally listed borobudur as a world heritage site in 1991
since then the profile of borobudur has increased enormously and it is now a major international tourist attraction
its statues reliefs and stupas have spawned millions of replicas which adorn properties worldwide
this huge popularity has its downsides
both deliberate vandalism and general wear and tear are of great concern for the future integrity of the monument
pleas for visitors not to touch anything are made in the form of signs by broadcast warnings and by the presence of guards but this does not stop the problem
many have called for the monument to be closed to casual visitors and for access to be only via timed guided tours
as well as being the single most popular tourist attraction in modern day indonesia borobudur has resumed its role as an important place of worship and pilgrimage for indonesian buddhists
visitors should be understanding and respectful of this especially during major buddhist holiday periods
the 2006 yogyakarta earthquake which badly damaged nearby prambanan left borobudur unscathed
the 2010 eruption of mount merapi[edit]borobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of mount merapi in october and november 2010
volcanic ash from merapi fell on the temple complex which is approximately 28 km 17.5 mi west southwest of the crater
during the strong eruption of 3–5 november for example a layer of ash up to 2.5 cm 1 in thick fell onto the temple
this also killed nearby vegetation
experts feared that the acidic ash might severely damage the historic site
the temple complex was closed from 5–9 november 2010 to clean up that ash fall and the upper levels remained closed to the public until late september 2011
upon reopening the upper levels the borobudur conservation agency announced that visitor numbers to those levels were restricted to under 82 people
unesco donated us $ 3 million as a part of rehabilitation costs to rid the temple 's stones of volcanic sediment then to plant trees to stabilise temperatures and finally to support the living conditions of local residents
more than 55,000 stone blocks from the temple structure had to be dismantled to enable restoration of the drainage system which had been clogged by slurry after rains
this restoration programme is predicted to be finished in november 2011
orientation[edit]borobudur lies in the kedu plain a very fertile volcanic plain between the twin volcanoes of mount sumbing and mount sundoro to the west and mount merbabu and mount merapi to the east
visit time[edit]every year more than 3 million people visit borobudur
borobudur is not only a favorite of foreign tourists but also domestic tourists mainly students of all ages usually in may and june
if you are planning a visit try not to visit during school holiday season it is worth investigating those dates
another date in the indonesian calendar to consider is that of idul fitri and up to a week after

the official government park authority for borobudur editget in[edit]by plane[edit]the nearest larger airports are yogyakarta 's adisucipto international airport iata jog and solo 's adisumarmo international airport iata soc
both are well connected domestically and also offer some international connections to singapore and kuala lumpur
airasia for example flies from singapore to yogyakarta daily
it is possible if one rushes oneself a bit to visit borobudur on a day trip from bali or jakarta
one can also fly direct to semarang 's achmad yani international airport iata srg with batavia air from singapore and with air asia from singapore and kuala lumpur and make your way to borobudur from there 2–3 hours by road
by bus[edit]the public buses to borobudur from yogyakarta are aimed mostly at indonesian visitors and only a few tourists venture aboard
if you are adventurous though the trans jogya service runs from central yogyakarta to jombor bus terminal in northern yogyakarta bus 2b/2a rp 3,000 where you can change to another bus to get to borobudur
it takes about 60–90 minutes and should cost around rp 10,000 20,000 one way
if you are a tourist the bus conductor may try to charge you more than the local rate so if you are on a very tight budget you can negotiate a little for a better price
buses run regularly from magelang to borobudur via muntilan and are widely advertised there
the journey time is about 1 hour
to get from or to the hindu temples at prambanan take a yogyakarta bus and get down at jombor terminal 90 min rp 15,000 for foreigners rp 7,000 for indonesians
from jombor take trans jogya route 2b to prambanan 45 60 min rp 3,000

by minibus[edit]travel agents in yogyakarta sell door to door minibus tour packages for around rp 75,000
this is a good deal and a straightforward way to reach the monument although some operators may stop off at batik and silver factories along the route
by car[edit]borobudur is about 40 minutes north of yogyakarta by car
most of the route is on a well maintained for indonesia four lane in many places highway and there are frequent bus services see above
a taxi from central yogyakarta to borobudur costs around rp 200,000 and from yogyakarta airport about rp 225,000
by train[edit]the nearest stations are in yogyakarta which is the major rail hub of central java

from the main tugu station it is easy to arrange taxi or bus transfers to borobudur
get around[edit]the only practical means of getting around borobudur is on foot
a toy train of limited practical use shuttles around the temple and between the museum and entrance gate for rp 5,000
if you are staying in the area most local hotels and guesthouses will rent bicycles for about rp 30,000 50,000 per day
this is a good way of exploring the other sights and local villages around borobudur

the site is open to public entrance from 6am-5pm
hiring a guide who can explain the reliefs in some detail costs rp 75,000 100,000 per hour
some guides may insist on a minimum time of two hours
you should ask for a guide in the evening before going to tour in the morning
it is also perfectly possible to roll up and find a guide available it all depends on how busy the site is
guides speaking european languages other than english may be available
in april 2011 it was announced that to assist in the ongoing preservation of the temple future visitors would be required to view the temple in groups of no more than 30 persons and must be accompanied by taman wisata candi borobudur twcb staff members
visitors are required to wear a sarong whilst visiting the temple although the rule does n't appear to be strictly enforced
if you do not bring your own then one is provided free with the entrance ticket
these are available at a post located at the bottom of the temple entrance stairs and should be returned before leaving at an exit post
the main site is approached through a large open and pleasant park inside the complex
the monument[edit][add listing]borobudur consists of six square platforms topped by three circular platforms and is decorated with no less than 2,672 relief panels and 504 buddha statues of various types
the main dome located at the centre of the top platform is surrounded by 72 buddha statues seated inside perforated stupas
the square base is 118 m 387 ft long on each side and the highest point 35 m 114 ft above ground level
the whole monument is constructed from dark grey andesite stone and so synonymous has this become with borobudur and other temples on the kedu plain that indonesian for the material is simply batu candi temple stone
climbing the structure takes a little bit of effort and the dark stone absorbs the sun 's heat rapidly to make walking and climbing quite hot work by early afternoon
if you have but modest stamina or heat tolerance you should start as early in the day as possible and take plenty of water with you
some free bottled water and coffee usually comes with the ticket for international visitors
the single structure can be divided into layers as follows the platform or foot at the base of the structure which was clearly post the original construction and hides some reliefs is of uncertain provenance and function
the main theories are that the platform was added to censor reliefs depicting earthly desires or rather more likely to buttress the subsiding structure and prevent it from collapsing
a section of the platform has been excavated at the southeast corner showcasing some of the hidden reliefs underneath
the bulk of the structure consists of six square terraces connected by steep staircases
each terrace has reliefs in two layers on both sides recounting the story of the buddha 's past lives and his enlightenment
the correct way to view the reliefs is to start from the east gate the main entrance and circulate clockwise
above the square terraces the structure opens up to reveal the final three circular terraces
comparatively plain and unadorned there are no more reliefs here just seventy two lattice work stupas domes housing half hidden buddha statues many headless some lost entirely
a bombing some years ago destroyed nine of them but they have been well restored
the peak of the structure is a central stupa
the two chambers inside the stupa are empty and it is unclear whether they were empty from the beginning as a representation of nirvana or whether they originally contained statues which were looted or lost
the site museum contains what might be a missing statue
the monument 's three divisions the square terraces and central stupa at the peak are regarded as one division symbolise the three realms of buddhist cosmology namely kamadhatu the world of desires rupadhatu the world of forms and arupadhatu the formless world
there are six different postures of buddha 's statue from the bottom level to the top
these are contact with earth giving and helping meditation fearlesness teach and learn and turning the wheel of dharma
the wall reliefs[edit]you can think of borobudur as a very large teaching graphic recounting the life story of the buddha his teachings and his progress towards nirvana
if you want to truly understand the reliefs it is best to employ a guide to explain the stories to you
in summary the 2,760 reliefs tell four key sets of stories in the form of carved illustrations and sanskrit inscriptions the law of karma or karmavibhangga
these are mostly hidden by the post original construction masking at the foot of the monument
the reliefs tell stories and give examples of the nature of karma with depictions of both praiseworthy including co operative working practices and planned parenthood and blameworthy including torture rape and theft activities
the masking was disassembled in 1890 before being painstakingly rebuilt and photographs were taken of the reliefs at this time
these photographs are displayed in the borobudur museum
the birth of buddha or lalitavistara
before the story starts there are 27 panels showing preparations for the final earthly incarnation
the story then begins with the descent of the lord buddha from heaven and continues until his first earthly sermon as prince siddhartha
the jatakas and avadanas
jatakas are stories about the buddha before he was born as prince siddhartha
avadanas are similar to jatakas but the main figure is not buddha himself
both are depicted in the same series of reliefs
the journeys of sudhana searching for ultimate truth or gandavyuha
this is the story told in the final chapter of the avatamsaka sutra about sudhana 's tireless wandering in search of the highest perfect wisdom sunrise[edit][add listing]normally around 5h30 to best see sunrise you have to go to a little hill see map near by manohara hotel be aware of the people that will try to guide you there if you do n't know the way(if you agree you can pay them max 10.000rp
the entrance to the viewpoint is 15,000rp for locals and 30,000 for foreigners
normally by motorbike it takes 1h15m-1h30 m from yogyakarta
however the manohara hotel see sleep runs a daily borobudur sunrise tour for rp 320,000 for foreigners rp 185,000 if you are a hotel guest and rp 220,000 for indonesians which gets you a flashlight and a lift up to the temple gate at 4:30am
this is in time to see the sunrise and to explore for an hour and a half before the hordes arrive
this is well worth the money
the sun rises in the same direction as the entrance you used to gain access to the temple
the top few levels offer a great view wherever you position yourself
if you 're so inclined grab a private spot facing east and enjoy your own precious few minutes of reflection or photography
the borobudur museum[edit][add listing]there are two museums located within borobudur archaeological park the karmawibhanga museum and the samudraraksa museum
these museums are housed inside the park just a few hundred metres to the north of the temple
these museum ticket are already included within the borobudur entrance ticket so visitor are free to enter the museum
the samudraraksa museum displays the actual size replica of borobudur ship
it also displays the maritime technology and trade network of 8th century asia and africa especially the maritime trade of indian ocean
in 1982 a british naval history scholar called philip beale was visiting borobudur when he noticed 10 panels depicting ocean going ships
he surmised that these ships may have been a part of a famous shipping route the cinnamon route that linked indonesia to africa many centuries earlier
this led beale to build a model ship based on those depictions and that is now housed in its own dedicated space within the museum
the karmawibhanga museum displays archaeological findings around borobudur the restoration process as well as the photographs of karmawibhanga relief on the hidden foot of borobudur
it does a sometimes haphazard job of presenting the restoration process
perhaps the most interesting exhibitions about this are those of the law of karma reliefs with explanatory comments and the photo gallery of late 19th century shots of the complex before it was restored
the museum is open daily 06:00 18:00 and entry is included with the main borobudur ticket
around borobudur[edit][add listing]between
yogyakarta and magelang lies the volcanic kedu plain
this was clearly an important area in pre-10th century javanese history as it contains a whole host of ruins both buddhist and hindu dating from the same era as borobudur and easily reached from there
if you have a car the most accessible of these together make an interesting use of the late part of the day on the way back to yogyakarta after you have seen borobudur
alternatively if you are staying in the borobudur area rent a bicycle and explore these temples together with the verdant local countryside
candi mendut near borobudura combined ticket for entrance to both candi mendut and candi pawon costs rp 3500
you should be able to visit any of these in the hours of daylight
candi mendut from borobudur head back towards muntilan on the main road for 3 km 1.8 mi and candi mendut is signposted off a small left hand turn off the main road 
a buddhist temple that is thought to have acted as a way point on the road to borobudur
it was first discovered in 1834 and holds the distinction of being the first ancient monument in the whole of indonesia to be restored from 1897
some of the statues and reliefs here are of the highest quality and it is well worth a visit
mendut is notable as the start of the modern day waisak procession
editcandi pawon is only 2 km 1.25 mi from borobudur and you can not miss driving past it when heading back towards muntilan and yogyakarta
both candi pawon and candi mendut are on a perfect straight line with borobudur
this temple was restored in the early 20th century
editcandi ngawen is in ngawen village just to the south of muntilan on the main road heading towards yogyakarta about 15 km 9 mi from borobudur
this buddhist temple dates from 824 ad and has some interesting wall reliefs
editcandi canggal candi gunung wukir
dates from the 8th century and is at gunung wukir on the main road heading back towards yogyakarta from muntilan
the best landmark is the chinese cemetery which you should look for on the right after leaving muntilan

follow this until the end and walk the last few minutes to candi canggal

it is often very quiet at this time and the sunset behind the mountains to the west is scenic
festivals[edit][add listing]on waisak buddha 's birthday held on the night of the full moon in may an elaborate and colourful multi day buddhist festival is held at borobudur culminating in a candle lit procession from candi mendut to borobudur
if you are lucky enough to be visiting at this time the procession is magical event to witness
at other times just walking the waisak procession route from borobudur to candi mendut or vice versa is an excellent experience
every june the park authority arranges a performance of the mahakarya borobudur
this ballet uses traditional javanese dance to tell the story of the conception and construction of the temple
the event takes place at the aksobya open theatre against the backdrop of borobudur and is a lavish production
tickets rp 300,000 800,000 buy[edit][add listing]persistent touts hassle tourists on the approaches to the temple but are usually kept away from the temple itself
be firm and polite about your intentions and they will soon get the message
be careful when you exit the temple as there are confusing signs pointing to exit gates which lead you through a maze of stalls
if you want to avoid the maze of handycraft stall do not turn left and follow the nearest exit sign just move straight forward to the exit located nearest to the entrance
if you do intend to buy some souvenirs here then make sure your bargaining skills are at their best
pedlars sell small statues that they claim are carved from lava stone but most are cast coloured cement
identifying genuine lava stone is easy enough as the stone is quite light for its size compared to the weightier concrete
nonetheless if a concrete buddha head will suffice you should not pay more than rp 20,000
their first offer is around rp 150,000 just tell them that you already bought for rp 20,000 and they will give you this price
an authentic lava stone version carved by a skilled craftsman will cost and be worth considerably more
should you be in need of cash there is a bank negara indonesia bni atm close to the main park entrance
muntilan[edit][add listing]muntilan is a market town on the main route from yogyakarta to magelang
when leaving borobudure muntilan is 13–14 km 8.5 mi back towards yogyakarta on the main road jalan magelang
it is also where transport for borobudur turns off the main road and it has developed as a leading manufacturing centre of carved stone borobudur replicas
as a typical market town in central java it is worth walking along the main street to have a sense of where tourism has not taken over completely as most tourists rush through a significant number of adjacent villages and areas treat this as their market town and it is possible to see the businesses and people who rely on javanese custom rather than tourist
in most cases though the food stores will still provide tourist food rather than what the local eats you would need a javanese or indonesian friend or guide to specify you want to eat local
muntilan is also a significant roman catholic heritage site being the location of the van lith mission in the nineteenth century it is also the place where senior members of the jesuits who served in yogyakarta and central java are buried
during the second world war muntilan was the site of a japanese prisoners camp
while very few tourists ever consider the back roads to the western slopes of merapi most roads that lead up to the western and north western slopes and village area leave from muntilan
also if you are using local transport rather than borobudur specific transport the stopping place at the markets is where you change transport
it is possible to catch mageland and semarang bound buses at this point as well
if you are thinking of buying a stone buddha stupa or wall relief this could be your port of call
eat and drink[edit]the bus station area is home to a multitude of hawker stalls selling standard indonesian street food and all manner of drinks
be aware that most close by 5pm
otherwise the only dining options are in hotels

yogyakarta is a student town with many colleges and universities and you will often find many students at borobudur who are keen to be friendly with you
take this how it is meant they are genuinely friendly and rightly very proud of their heritage and keen to talk to you about it
to avoid the largest crowds skip weekends when large numbers of domestic tourists visit along with the occasional school trip of students sent by their teachers to practice their english on overseas visitors
alternatively visit as early as you can in the morning
