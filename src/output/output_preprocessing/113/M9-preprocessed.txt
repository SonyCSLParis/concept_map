descriptive analysis the borobudur temple compounds is a large site with many buddhist statues
the one featured in the picture is just one of many
it was made of stone like the rest of the site is
the stature is shown in a seated position
the buddhist statue is seated inside of a circular platform
the platform has many individual stones which create the circle
each stone has a hole in the top of each
the holes that are seen on top are not visible from the picture enough to tell how far that they go down the stone
each stone almost touches each other there is a small crack in between each
they may at once have been touching
each stone is shaped like an hour glass figure
the two hands of the statue are touching each other in front of the rib cage region
three fingers are sticking up on one hand
the other hand as the thumb and index finger interlocked with each other
the body is proportional
the eyes lips nose head arms and body all go together
the only thing that looks like it is not proportional is the ears
they are very long and large compared to everything else
the statues eyes are closed
there are three rings going around the neck giving the statue a neck that looks tight
the statue has hair on the head
it goes all around and comes to a ball shape on the middle top
the hair is shown by circles going around in lines on the head
the body of the buddhist statue has no definition to it
the viewer does not see any muscles
it is only known where the elbows are because the arms are bent
the stone of the buddhist statue is in good condition
there is some discoloration throughout the stone though
some parts are lighter and some parts are darker than others
the stone may have some damage
it appears as if some may have been eroded away
the statue over all is in very good condition though
behind the statue the viewer sees large objects made of stone more part of the temple
these objects are made of different colored squares of stone
this part of the temple looks rougher
it appears as though there may have been more damage and erosion here compared to the buddhist statue
formal and contextual analysis this buddhist statue as well as the entirety of the borobudur temple compounds was used as a place of worship for buddhists on pilgrimages
there are three tiers of the compounds which are meant to symbolize the three stages of buddhist cosmology kamadhatu- world of desire rupadhatu- the world of forms arupadhatu- the world of formlessness
this is important in determining the importance of this particular statue which is located right before the top of the temple which represents the world of formlessness or arupadhatu
this realm is the highest division of the threefold world
the world of formlessness lies above the world of form and the world of desire
it is the immaterial realm of the spirit which is said to be free from the limitations of matter and from all thought of matter
this definition gives a deeper insight to the context in which the buddha is displayed
buddhist statues use something known as mudra to convey their meanings
these are simply hand gestures that carry a universal iconography throughout the buddhist faith
the statue found at the borobudur temple compounds mudra is known as the gesture of turning the wheel of dharma
this has a few different meanings within it the thumb and index finger of the right hand stand for wisdom and method combined the other three raised fingers symbolize the teaching of the buddhist doctrine which leads sentient or consciousness beings to the paths of the beings of three capacities enlightened beings
the position of the left hand symbolizes the beings of the three capacities which follow the combined path of method and wisdom
the mudra and the placement of the buddha right before the top which is used to represent the world of formlessness conveys a direct message to the buddhist on his pilgrimage
it tells whoever is on their pilgrimage that through the wisdom and method of the buddhist faith it is possible for them to become a being of three capacities and free themselves of thought
since the buddhist faith calls for buddhists to leave all worldly attachments behind and become a wander which implies a somewhat lonely lifestyle the statue would serve as a positive reminder to the buddhist on their pilgrimage as to what they are striving for
the buddha â€™s seated position is a common one and many look similar to this one with its eyes closed
this is used to show the buddha is in great concentration in his meditation
once you can understand the context in which this statue is displayed and its symbolism you are able to learn a lot about the culture of buddhist of this time
the statue conveys messages of wisdom method and faith to achieve an enlightened state of being
this shows that these aspects of a buddhist life were important to them in the 8th and 9th century
