bowie is also known for the style of knife he carried which came to be known as the bowie knife
 stories of his frontier spirit have made him one of the most colorful folk heroes of texas history
he was born in kentucky and spent most of his life in louisiana
bowie worked as a land speculator for several years but many of his land deals were fraudulent based on forged titles
he gained fame in 1827 when he participated in the sandbar fight and killed the sheriff of rapides parish with a large knife
newspapers printed the story of the fight and within the next few years bowie 's fame and that of his knife spread around the world
in 1830 bowie moved to texas where he became a mexican citizen and married the daughter of the then vice governor of the province
bowie was often away from home in the early years of his marriage and spent several months looking for the lost los almagres mine
his death at the alamo ensured that bowie would be remembered as a hero whatever wrongs he may have committed
his story belongs to that of the push to the west where individuals like bowie bent on bettering their lot no matter what the costs thrived in fulfillment of the american dream
early years james bowie was born april 10 1796 in logan county kentucky the ninth of ten children born to rezin bowie and elve ap catesby jones
his father had been injured while fighting in the american revolution and in 1782 married the young woman who had nursed him back to health
the bowies moved a great deal first settling in georgia where they had six children and then moving to kentucky
at the time of bowie 's birth his father owned eight slaves seven horses 11 head of cattle and one stud horse
the following year the family had acquired 200 acres 80 hectare along the red river
in 1800 rezin bowie sold his property and the family spent two years in missouri
they moved to spanish louisiana in 1802 when he was six[1 settling on the bushley bayou in rapides parish
2 3]the bowie family moved again in 1809 settling on bayou teche in louisiana
they found a permanent home in opelousas parish in 1812
4 each of their homes was on the frontier and even as a small child bowie was expected to help clear the land and plant crops
he and his siblings were educated at home and learned to read and write in english
bowie and his elder brother rezin could also speak read and write spanish and french fluently
5 the children were also taught how to survive on the frontier
bowie became proficient with a pistol rifle and knife
he and his siblings were also taught to fish and how to run a farm and plantation
6 bowie had a reputation for fearlessness and as a boy one of his indian friends taught him how to rope alligators
7 he also battled with an array of other ferocious wild animals including bears and mustangs
1]at age 15 bowie left home and settled in rapides parish,[3
8 where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating it down the bayou for sale
3 9 in june 1819 bowie joined the long expedition
led by dr. james long the expedition of 75 men wished to free texas from spanish oversight
10][11 the group encountered little resistance and after capturing nacogdoches declared texas an independent republic
the depth of bowie 's participation is unclear but the invasion eventually collapsed
12]land speculator shortly before bowie 's father died in 1818 or 1819 he gifted bowie and his brother rezin each ten servants horses and cattle
for the next seven years the brothers worked together to develop several large estates in lafourche parish and opelousas parish
9 louisiana was gaining population rapidly and the brothers wished to take advantage of rising land prices by speculating in land but did not have the capital required to buy large tracts of land
13 to raise money they entered into a partnership with pirate jean lafitte in 1818
the united states had previously outlawed the importation of slaves and to encourage citizens to report the unlawful activity most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction
bowie made three trips to lafitte 's compound on galveston island
he would buy smuggled slaves from lafitte then bring the slaves directly to a customhouse and inform on himself
the customs officers would put the slaves up for auction and bowie would buy them back
due to the state laws he would receive half of the price he had paid
he could then legally transport the slaves and resell them in new orleans or areas further up the mississippi river
14 once they had collected $ 65,000 the brothers opted out of the slave trade and began speculating in land
15 16]in 1825 the two brothers joined with their younger brother stephen to buy acadia a plantation near alexandria
within two years they had set up the first steam mill in louisiana to be used for grinding sugar cane
3][9][17 the plantation became known as a model estate but on february 12 1831 they sold it and 65 slaves for $ 90,000
with their profits bowie and rezin bought a plantation in arkansas
9]bowie and his brother john were involved in a large court case in the late 1820s over their land speculation in louisiana
when the united states purchased the louisiana territory in 1803 the country had promised to honor all former land grant claims and for the next 20 years tried to determine who owned what land
in may 1824 congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from people who claimed they had been overlooked
the arkansas superior court received 126 claims in late 1827 from arkansas residents who claimed to have purchased land in former spanish grants from the bowies
although the superior court confirmed most of these those confirmations were reversed in february 1831 when further research showed the land had never belonged to the bowies and that the original land grant documentation was forged
the u.s. supreme court upheld the rejection in 1833
18][19 when the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the bowies they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed to the court left with no evidence they declined to pursue a case
20]bowie knifea bowie knife
bowie 's fame came about as a result of a feud with norris wright the sheriff of rapides parish
the two had participated on opposite sides of political party squabbles and competed against each other in land speculation ventures
bowie had support wright 's opponent in the race for sheriff and wright a bank director had been instrumental in turning down bowie 's loan application
the two met by chance on a street in alexandria one afternoon and wright fired a shot at bowie
an uninjured bowie was enraged and tried to kill wright with his bare hands
wright 's friends intervened and stopped the attack and bowie resolved to carry his hunting knife on his person from then on
21 the knife he carried was likely given to him by his brother rezin,[17
this and had a huge blade that was nine and one quarter inches long and one and one half inches wide
22]the following year on september 19 1827 bowie and wright attended a duel on the vidalia sandbar outside of natchez mississippi
bowie supported duelist samuel levi wells iii
wright supported wells opponent dr. thomas harris maddox
the duelists each fired two shots and as neither man had been injured resolved their duel with a handshake
23 other members of the groups who had various reasons for disliking each other began fighting
bowie was shot in the hip after regaining his feet he drew a large knife described as a butcher knife and charged his attacker
the attacker hit bowie over the head with his empty pistol breaking the pistol and knocking bowie to the ground
wright shot at and missed the prone bowie who returned fire and possibly hit wright
wright then drew his sword cane and impaled bowie
when wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on bowie 's chest and tugging bowie pulled him down and disemboweled him with his knife
24 wright died instantly and bowie with wright 's sword still protruding from his chest was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group
the doctors who had been present for the duel managed to retrieve the bullets and patch bowie 's other wounds
25]newspapers picked up the story which became known as the sandbar fight
bowie 's fighting prowess and his knife were described in detail
witness accounts all agreed that bowie did not attack first and the others had focused their attack on bowie because they considered him the most dangerous man among their opposition
26 the fight cemented bowie 's reputation across the south as a superb knife fighter
17]there is disagreement among scholars as to whether the knife used in this fight was the same kind of knife now known as a bowie knife
many different accounts exist of who designed and built the first bowie knife
some claim that bowie designed it and others attribute the design to noted knifemakers of the time
27 however in a letter to the planter 's advocate rezin bowie claimed to have invented the knife
28 and many bowie family members and most authorities on the bowie knife tend to believe it was invented by bowie 's brother rezin
29]after the sandbar fight and subsequent battles in which bowie successfully used his knife to defend himself his knife became very popular
many craftsman and manufacturers made their own versions of the knife and many major cities of the southwest had bowie knife schools which taught the art of cut thrust and parry
30 his fame and that of his knife spread to england and by the early 1830s many british knife manufacturers were producing bowie knives shipping many of them to the united states for sale
31 the design of the knife continued to evolve and it is generally agreed to have a blade 8.25 inches long and 1.25 inches 3.175 cm wide with a curved point
it had a sharp false edge cut from both sides and a cross guard to protect the user 's hands
32]texasestablishing himself after fully recovering from the wounds he suffered in the sandbar fight in 1828 bowie decided to move to texas
33 the 1824 constitution of mexico banned religions other than roman catholicism and gave preference to mexican citizens in receiving land
34 he was baptized into the roman catholic faith in san antonio on april 28 1828 sponsored by the san antonio alcade mayor juan martin de veramendi and his wife josefa navarro
35 after that he returned to his travels in louisiana and mississippi
in 1829 he became engaged to cecilia wells but she died in alexandria on september 29 two weeks before their wedding
17]on january 1 1830 bowie and his friend isaac donoho left thibodaux for a permanent residency in texas
they are documented as having stopped at nacogdoches at jared e. groce 's farm on the brazos river and in san felipe where bowie presented a letter of introduction to stephen f. austin from thomas f. mc kinney one of the old three hundred colonists
on february 20 bowie and his friend took the oath of allegiance to mexico and then proceeded to san antonio de bexar
17 at the time san antonio de bexar known as bexar had a population of 2500 people mostly of mexican descent and bowie 's fluency in spanish helped him to establish himself in the area
36]later that year bowie was elected a commander of the texas rangers
although the unit would not be officially organized until 1835 stephen f. austin founded the group by employing up to 30 men to help keep the peace primarily by chasing indians
other areas began similar volunteer militias and bowie had been elected by a group of the volunteers
37]bowie became a mexican citizen on september 30 1830 after promising to establish textile mills in the province of coahuila y tejas
38 bowie entered into partnership with veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in saltillo
39 with his citizenship assured bowie now had the right to buy up to 11 leagues of public land
he convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land and turn it over to him giving him 700,000 acres 2,834 km² of land to speculate with
bowie may also have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants and then buy it from him
39 the mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation
40]on april 25 1831 bowie married 19 year old ursula maria de veramendi the daughter of his business partner who had become the vice governor of the province
several days before the ceremony he signed a dowry contract promising to pay his new bride 15,000 pesos in cash or property within two years of the marriage
at the time bowie claimed to have a net worth of $ 223,000 most of it in land with questionable titles
bowie also lied about his age claiming to be 30 rather than 35
41 the couple built a house in san antonio on land de veramendi had given them near the san josé mission
after a short time however they moved into the veramendi palace living with ursula 's parents who supplied them with spending money
42 the couple had two children marie elve born march 20 1832 and james veramendi born july 18 1833

44]san saba mine
in the first years of his marriage bowie was often away from home either pursuing indians with the rangers or for business deals and silver mine hunts
43 shortly after his marriage he became fascinated with the story of the lost los almagres mine said to be west of san antonio near the ruin of santa cruz de san sabá mission
22 the mine had been operated by the local indians before being seized by the spanish
after mexico won independence from spain government interest in the mines waned
a number of hostile indian tribes roamed the area including comanche lipan apache and karankawa and without government troops to keep the tribes at bay mining ceased
it was believed that after the mexican citizens left the area the lipan apaches took over the mines
43]bowie quickly obtained permission from the mexican government to mount an expedition into indian territory to search for the legendary silver mine
on november 2 1831 with his brother rezin and nine others bowie set out for san saba six miles 10 kilometers from their goal the group realized that they were being followed by a large indian raiding party and stopped to negotiate
the attempts at parley failed and bowie and his group were forced to fight for their lives for the next 13 hours
when the indians finally retreated bowie had reportedly lost only one man while over 40 indians had been killed and 30 more wounded
15][22]the group returned to san antonio on december 10 and bowie wrote a report in spanish of the expedition
the report was later printed in several newspapers further establishing bowie 's reputation
45 the following month bowie set out again with a larger force
after two and a half months of searching the group returned home with nothing to show for their efforts
17 the group also wanted to gain revenge for the previous year 's attack
the indians had learned they were coming however and fled and although bowie and his group rode for several hundred miles they never saw an indian
46]despite his increasing fame bowie never talked of his exploits
47 captain william y. lacey who spent eight months living in the wilderness with bowie described him as an humble man who never used profanity or vulgarities
48]texas independence tension was beginning to rise between the mexican officials and the mainly anglo citizenry as the mexican legislature passed new laws between 1830 and 1832 that seemed to discriminate against american colonists in the province of coahuila y tejas
in response to the rumblings mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province including san antonio de bexar
49 in july 1832 bowie who was in natchez heard that the mexican commander of nacogdoches jose de las piedras had demanded that all residents in his area surrender their arms
17 bowie returned to texas and on august 2 1832 joined a group of other texans in marching into nacogdoches to present their demands to piedras
49 before the group reached the building housing the town officials they were attacked by a force of 100 mexican cavalry
the texans returned fire and after the cavalry retreated initiated a siege of the garrison
49 after a second battle in which piedras lost 33 men the mexican army evacuated during the night
bowie and 18 companions ambushed the fleeing army and after piedras fled marched the soldiers back to nacogdoches
17 bowie later served as a delegate to the convention of 1833 which drew up a document formally requesting independent statehood in mexico
50]several months later a cholera epidemic broke out in texas and many believed the disease would reach san antonio
believing his family would be safer in the mountains bowie sent his pregnant wife and their daughter to the family estate in monclova in the company of her parents and brother
the cholera epidemic instead struck monclova and between september 6 and september 14 ursula her children her brother and her parents died of the disease
51 bowie on business in natchez heard of his family 's deaths in november
from then on he drank heavily and became careless in his dress

50]bowie returned to land speculation in texas in 1834 after the mexican government passed new laws allowing land sale in the state
he was appointed a land commissioner tasked with promoting settlement in the area purchased by john t. mason
his appointment ended in may 1835 when santa anna abolished the coahuila y
tejas government and ordered the arrest of all texans including bowie doing business in monclova
bowie was forced to flee mexico and return to the san felipe nacogdoches area of texas
17]santa anna began preparing for war sending large numbers of mexican troops to texas as the anglos in texas began agitating for war
bowie worked with william b. travis the leader of the war party to gain support for war with bowie even visiting several indian villages in east texas to try to convince the reluctant tribes to fight against mexico
17]stephen f. austin returned to texas in september 1835 and was soon elected the commander of the volunteer army in texas
bowie joined the army with a small party of friends from louisiana and austin quickly named him a colonel
on the orders of austin and general sam houston who commanded the texas regular army bowie and captain james w. fannin scouted the area south of bexar
on the 28th of october a mexican force consisting of three hundred cavalry and a hundred infantry attacked bowie and his 92 horsemen
at the end of the skirmish bowie had lost only one man while the mexican army suffered 16 fatalities and had 16 men wounded
17]following the battle bowie tried several times to resign his commission preferring to contribute to fights when needed but less interested in holding a formal command
17 after a brief absence from the army he returned in late november and accompanied by 40 cavalry successfully took a packtrain guarded by mexican troops which carried food for the mexican garrison livestock in a battle known as the grass fight
52]the alamo houston received word that mexican general santa anna was coming to san antonio with a large force of soldiers
bowie volunteered to lead volunteers to defend the alamo a fortress like structure that had served as home to missionaries and their indian converts for 70 years then abandoned and used as barracks by several armies before the events of 1835
bowie asked for volunteers and 30 men agreed to accompany him
they arrived on january 19 where they found a force of 104 men with a few weapons and a few cannon but little supplies and gunpowder
53 houston knew that there were not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given bowie orders to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification
bowie and the captain of the forces james c. neill decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery someplace safer and they did not want to destroy the fortress
on january 26 one of bowie 's men james bonham organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the alamo
bonham signed the resolution first with bowie 's signature second
54]they were joined in the next few weeks by william travis with 30 men and davy crockett with 12 additional men
after the alamo 's commander colonel james c. neill left the mission the men elected bowie as their commander
he celebrated by getting drunk
after that spectacle bowie agreed to share responsibility with travis
17]fearing for the safety of his wife 's relatives in san antonio bowie asked her cousins getrudis navarro and juana navarro alsbury as well as alsbury 's 18 month old son alijo to come to stay inside the walls of the alamo
55]bowie had been ill and two doctors including the fort surgeon were unable to diagnose his illness
56 on february 21 bowie broke his hip after falling 15 ft 5 m from a scaffold while trying to mount a cannon
57][58 he was thereafter confined to his bed and travis became the sole commander of the forces
58 santa anna and his army reached the outskirts of san antonio de bexar several days later,[59 and the army began a siege of the alamo on february 24
santa anna raised a red flag to alert the men that he would give no quarter
60]the alamo circa 1846 travis sent juan seguin to recruit reinforcements on february 25 and 32 additional men were able to join the texans in the fort
61 according to louis moses rose the only man known to have deserted the texan forces at the alamo when travis realized that the mexicans would prevail in the upcoming battle travis drew a line in the sand and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line
all of the men crossed the line except for rose and bowie who was lying on his cot in the courtyard
bowie asked that his cot be carried over the line and crockett and several others assisted him in joining the others
62 after its initial publication this account was confirmed by several other eyewitnesses[63][64 but the story can only be authenticated by the word of the reporter who admitted to embellishing other articles and thus many historians refuse to believe it

64]bowie perished with the rest of the alamo defenders 188 total on march 6 when the mexicans attacked before dawn
after the conclusion of the battle santa anna ordered the alcade of san antonio francisco antonio ruiz to confirm the identities of bowie travis and crockett
65 santa anna first gave orders for bowie to be buried saying he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog,[66 but later changed his mind and had bowie 's body placed with those of the other texians on the funeral pyre
65 to burn bodies was in violation of all military honor which required that a soldier receive a proper burial
to burn bodies disrespectfully in a mass heap inflamed the emotions and outrage of all that heard of it leading to the rallying cry remember the alamo
when bowie 's mother was informed of his death she calmly stated i 'll wager no wounds were found in his back
67 various eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of bowie 's death
according to a newspaper article a mexican soldier claimed to have seen bowie brought from his room on his cot alive after the conclusion of the battle
the soldier maintained that bowie verbally castigated a mexican officer in fluent spanish and the officer ordered bowie 's tongue cut out and his still breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre
this account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses and it thought to have been invented by the reporter
68 other witnesses maintained that they saw several mexican soldiers enter bowie 's room bayonet him and carry him alive from the room
69 various other stories circulated with witnesses claiming that bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head
70 alcade ruiz however said that bowie was found dead in his bed
70 the most popular and probably the most accurate"[71 version is that bowie died on his cot back braced against the wall and using his pistols and his famous knife
 70 one year after the battle juan seguin returned to the alamo and gathered the remaining ashes
he placed these in a coffin inscribed with the names of bowie travis and crockett
the ashes were interred at the cathedral of san fernando
72]legacydespite his continual pronouncements of wealth after bowie 's death his actual estate was found to be very small
his possessions were sold at auction and brought in only $ 99.50
73 his larger legacy is his position as one of the legendary characters of the american frontier

11]bowie is remembered as a rugged frontiersman and an individual bent on bettering his lot no matter what the costs
he was strong willed and adventurous
bowie was highly ambitious and would strive long and hard to see to the realization of his goals
he is most often associated with the knife that bears his name
