first consultation and convention san felipe de austin 1 oct 1832
the first two assemblies of colonists who had come to texas at the invitation of the liberal principles of republicanism established by the republic of mexico under the constitution of 1824 were organized as a mechanism of explanation of concern and the cause of unrest among the settlements
ironically the colonists were in support of future centralista dictator antonio lopez de santa anna who had taken up the cause of republicanism and restoration of the principles of 1824
times prior to the convention were cause for optimism since the xenophobic and racist bustamente 's military leader had left the state and general mexia had confirmed to santa anna the loyalty of the colonists
the call for this convention was issued september 14 1832 by horatio chriesman the first alcalde of san felipe and john austin the second alcalde of brazoria fifty six elected delegates from the municipalities presented credentials and took seats
stephen f. austin was elected president defeating william wharton and francis w. johnson was elected secretary
wharton was appointed chair of the committee to prepare the memorials to the government reflecting proceedings of the meetings
representatives from san antonio declined participation and no representatives from la bahia were present during the main meeting but appeared toward the end at which time rafael manchola was elected to be among the representatives to communicate proceedings of the meeting to government officials

memorial to the mexican government
san felipe de austin october 4 1832 to the federal congress of mexico your memorialists representatives of all the anglo americans of texas in general convention met taking advantage of that sacred republican privilege of making known their wants and grievances which is guaranteed them by the constitution of their adopted country respectfully represent that they have viewed and still view with sentiments of deepest regret and mortification the passage and present existence of the eleventh article of the law of the sixth of april 1830
this law is obnoxious to your memorialists for many reasons independent of its withering influence on all the hopes of texas it implies a suspicion of our fidelity to the mexican constitution
such suspicion we humbly conceive to be utterly unwarranted and we will endeavor to prove it so by making a review of our conduct from the passage of the first colonization law up to the present time
in the year 1823 the congress of the mexican nation invited the citizens of the united states of the north to become inhabitants of texas giving to each family one sitio of land for so doing
this donation of land sounds large at a distance
considering however the difficulties with which the taking possession of it is envisioned it will not be thought so munificent a bounty nor so entire a gratuity
had these lands been previously pioneered by the enterprise of government and freed from the insecurities which beset a wilderness trod upon by savages had they been in the heart of an inhabited region and accessible to the comforts and necessaries of life had the government been deriving an actual revenue from them could it have realized a capital from the sale of them then we admit the donation would have been unexampled in the history of national liberality
but how different from all this was the real state of the case
the lands in question were situated in a wilderness of which the government had never taken possession
they were not sufficiently explored to obtain that knowledge of their character and situation which would be necessary to a sale of them they were in the occupancy of savages they were shut out from all commercial intercourse with the world and inaccessible to the commonest comforts of life nor were they brought into possession and cultivation without much toil and privation patience and enterprise loss of lives from indian hostilities and other causes
under the smiles of a beneficent heaven however r the untiring perseverence of the immigrants triumphed over all natural obstacles it reduced the forest to cultivation- made the desert smile established commercial intercourse with the rest of the world and expelled the savages by whom the country was infested
from this it must appear that the lands of texas although nominally given were in fact really and dearly bought
it may be here premised that a gift of land by a nation to foreigners on conditions of their becoming citizens is immensely different from a gift or sale from one individual to another
in the case of individuals the donor or seller loses all further claim upon the lands parted with but in this case the government only gave wild lands that they might be redeemed from a state of nature that the obstacles to a first settlement might be overcome and that they might be placed in a situation to augment the physical strength power and revenue of the nation
is it not obvious that mexico now holds the same jurisdiction over the colonized lands of texas that all nations hold over nineteen twentieths of their territory
for the first six or seven years after the commencement of our settlements in texas we gratefully admit that our enterprise was animated and our hardship alleviated by the liberality and kindness of the mexican government
we insist however that this beneficent disposition of the government was followed by gratitude and loyalty on our part
the only portion of our conduct during this period that could be tortured into anything like disloyalty was the fredonian disturbance in nacogdoches in 1826
and when it is considered by whom these disturbances were originated and by whom quieted instead of exciting the suspicion of the government we respectfully conceive that the transaction should have confirmed its confidence in our patriotism
the disturbances alluded to originated with some fifteen or twenty infatuated individuals
the great mass of the settlers were opposed to their mad design which opposition they testified by capturing the conspirators and putting them in custody before the arrival of a single mexican soldier
was there anything in this calculated to awaken the suspicions of the government
bad and desperate men there will always be found in every community
there will always likewise be a portion capable of being easily misled and it is not really a matter of astonishment that in this instance the bad the desperate the dissatisfied and the misguided are limited to so insignificant a number
excepting this disturbance which was opposed by ninety nine hundredths of the settlers and which was quieted by their zeal and patriotism we repeat it that up to the passage of the law of april 6 1830 our conduct was orderly and patriotic
the passage of this law was a mortifying and melancholy occurrence for texas
it was mortifying to us for it blasted all our hopes and was enough to dishearten all our enterprise
it was peculiarly mortifying because it admitted into texas all other nations except our friends and countrymen of the united states of the north except the fathers and brothers of many of us for whom we had emigrated to prepare comfortable homes and whose presence to gladden our firesides we were hourly anticipating
yes this law closed the door of immigration on the only sister republic worthy of the name which mexicans can boast of in this new world
it closed the door on a people among whom the knowledge and foundations of national liberty are more deeply laid than any other on the habitable globe
it closed the door upon a people who have brought with them to texas those ideals of republican government in which from birth they had been educated and practiced
in short it closed the door upon a people who generously and heroically aided mexico in her revolutionary struggle and who were the first and foremost to recognize and rejoice at the obtainment of her independence
is it for a moment to be supposed that the european parasites of power to whom now alone the door of immigration is left open that those who have been taught from infancy to believe in the natural inequality of mankind who have been unacquainted with constitutions even in name who politically speaking have never been accustomed to think or legislate for themselves who reverence the arm of monarchial rule who pay adulation at the feet of an hereditary nobility and who have contemplated republics only in theory and at a distance is it we repeat to be supposed that immigrants of this description will contribute more to the advancement of liberty and the welfare of the republic than immigrants from that land of liberal sentiments that cradle of freedom that mother of constitutional heroes the united states of the north if such be the fact habit and education must go for nothing and all experience is set at naught and a contradiction
your memorialists having as they trust and respectfully conceive shown to your honorable bodies that their conduct up to the time of the passage of the law of april 6 1830 was orderly and patriotic will now turn your attention to their conduct since that period
this law was sufficient to goad us on to madness in as much as it blasted all our hopes and defeated all our calculations inasmuch as it showed to us that we were to remain scattered isolated and unhappy tenants of the wilderness of texas compelled to gaze upon the resources of a lovely and fertile region undeveloped for want of a population and cut off front the society of fathers and friends in the united states of the north to prepare homes and comforts suited to whose age and infirmities many of us had patiently submitted to every species of privation
but what was our conduct
as peaceful citizens we submitted
the wheels of government were not retarded in their operation by us
not a voice nor an arm was uplifted
we had confidence in the correct intentions of the government and we believed and hoped that when the momentary excitement of tile day had subsided a returning sense of justice and liberality would give this law a brief duration
for more than two years we have remained in this peaceful this unmurmuring attitude
in this time the heroic and patriotic general santa anna arose as the vindicator of liberty and the constitution
we had confidence in the purity of his motives
we believed that the evils which he battled to redress were of an alarming and crying magnitude of no less magnitude than all utter disregard of the constitution on the part of the vice president and his ministers
with general santa anna we united as fellow laborers in the same sacred cause preferring rather to perish in defense of the violated charter of our rights than to live in acquiescence with acts of arbitrary and unconstitutional power
what we have done in this matter is known to the government and to tile world
it was all in defense of the rights liberties and guaranties that were spurned and trampled upon
here we would ask what was there in all this to induce suspicion of our disloyalty to the constitution was it in our remaining quiet for more than two years after the passage of the law of the 6th of april
was it in declaring for the constitution and hazarding all we held dear in its defense
would it not have been easy to have taken advantage of the troubles in the interior and to have declared and battled for independence
was there ever a time more opportune and inviting why did we not then declare for independence
because in the holiest sincerity of our hearts we assure you and we call almighty god to witness the truth of the assertion we did not then and we do not now wish for independence
no there is not all anglo american in texas whose heart does not beat high for the prosperity of the mexican republic who does not cordially and devoutly wish that all parts of her territory may remain united to the end of time that she may steadily and rapidly advance in arts arms agriculture commerce manufactures and in learning virtue freedom and all that can add to the splendor and happiness of a great nation
as all evidence that we wished not for independence nor for coalescence with the united states of the north your memorialists would respectfully refer your honorable bodies to the following fact viz a short while since it was rumored among us that the president of the united states of the north exposed a determination to make the neches river instead of the sabine the line between the two republics
this hitherto unheard of claim provoked the indignation of every inhabitant of texas and our constituents have with one voice called upon us to memorialize your honorable bodies on the subject of the injustice of such a demand
may it please our honorable bodies your memorialists trust that they have conclusively shown that the whole tenor of their conduct has been characterized by good order and patriotism
the destructive influence of the law of the 6th of april 1830 upon the prospects of texas has only been incidentally alluded to the effect of that law being too obvious to require expatiation or argument
the law is likewise as injurious to the national revenue at large as to us individually for it is evident that the greatness the power the wealth and independence of a nation depend upon a proper development of its resources
can the resources of texas be properly developed with this law hanging over it
we believe not
we believe under such circumstances it would remain the comparative wilderness it now is
experience shows that native mexican- will not settle in it but should they do so it would not augment the physical force of the nation for it would only be taking population from one part of the republic to place them in another
will europeans settle
we believe europeans of the right description to benefit the country will not for many reasons
our hopes then for the development of the resources of texas are naturally turned to the united states of the north to a people who have been trained in the school of republicanism whose physical constitutions are adapted to the climate and who have been brought up to the cultivation of such articles as will always be the staples of texas
against them alone however the door is closed which we contend is equally injurious to its and to the national revenue
another point of view in which the law of the 6th of april is objectionable and has been productive of numberless difficulties is this the garrisons with which all parts of texas have been lately crowded must have grown out of this law and have been sent here to enforce it
they could not have been sent here for our protection for when they came we were able to protect ourselves and at the commencement of the settlements when we were few weak and scattered and defenseless not a garrison no not a soldier came to our aid
in the presence and vicinity of these garrisons the civil arm has generally been paralyzed and powerless for many of the officers were law despisers who set the political authorities at defiance brought them into contempt and trespassed in every respect upon the rights and privileges of their fellow citizens
when all of these things are considered we can but believe that the former characteristic justice and liberality of your honorable body will return to our aid and bring about an immediate repeal of this to us ever to be deprecated measure
that justice that liberality we now most respectfully solemnly unanimously and confidently invoke
william wharton chairman luke leassier jonas harrison george sutherland patrick c. jackresponses and impact of the consultation
the following report of 16 oct to the ayuntamiento of bexar summarizes the meeting and was an appeal for support of the residents of bexar to support its goals pursuant to a call of the alcalde of this municipality a general meeting of the inhabitants of texas through delegates took place in this town on the 1st inst
fifty eight delegates being present
the object of the meeting was to make to the general congress an exposition of the situation of texas
after full deliberation it was concluded to represent to the congress agreeably to article 2d of the law of may 7th 1824 that texas has the proper requisites to form singly a state separate from coahuila
it was further agreed to claim a reform of the maritime tariff and the abrogation of article 11th of the law of april 6th 1830 prohibiting the immigration of natives of the united states of the north
a request was also made to the government to appoint a commissioner for the settlement of land matters and to establish an ayuntamiento between the san jacinto and sabine rivers also to grant certain lands to the ayuntamientos of texas by the sale whereof they might raise the funds needed to erect school houses and support schools of the spanish and english languages
in view of the exposed situation of the country to indian depredations the convention agreed upon framing a provincial regulation for the militia
they also appointed a standing or central committee in this town and subordinate committees in every section represented in the body
it was made the duty of the central committee to correspond with the subordinate committees inform them concerning subjects of general interest and in case of emergency to call another general meeting or texas convention
this committee was further instructed to open a correspondence with the people of bexar and to invite them to cooperate in the furtherance of the foregoing objects
the general meeting under a sense of the high importance of the matters discussed and acted upon agreed upon sending a delegate to saltillo and mexico charged with the duty of earnestly urging them upon the consideration of the government and to that end they selected citizen william h. wharton as their representative
it was the earnest wish of the convention that some suitable person either from bexar or goliad should accompany the delegate from this town and co operate with him in the presentation to the government of the matters confided to his management but they took no step in that direction not knowing whether the people of those sections would approve of what had been done
but after the meeting had concluded their business the delegates from goliad arrived and having manifested to the committee their hearty acquiescence in the conclusions reached by that convention and expressed the wish of the people of goliad that a delegate should be appointed from their district to accompany citizen william h. wharton on his mission before mentioned and don rafael manchola having been suggested it was agreed by the committee jointly with the delegates from goliad that he receive the appointment subject to the concurrence of all the subordinate committees
it was also agreed that the expenses of the delegates should be defrayed by means of voluntary contributions and for this purpose the subordinate committees are instructed to open subscriptions aggregating the sum of four thousand dollars out of which each delegate shall be paid the sum of two thousand dollars
all the foregoing i communicate to your body by order of the convention hoping that the people of bexar will approve the measures adopted and proceed to the appointing of a committee in that city charged with the duty of a correspondence with the committee of this town
it is hoped also that you will approve the appointment of don rafael manchola to proceed to saltillo and mexico in company with mr. wharton for the purposes above stated and that you will acquaint the central committee in this town as soon as possible with your decision and furnish them the names of the members of the committee appointed in your city
so soon as the documents embodying the several subjects acted upon by the convention shall have been translated into spanish copies thereof will be sent to the committee of your city for the information of the public
god and the prosperity of texas
f. w. johnson chairman james b. miller secretary the meeting was an open one and results were communicated frankly and openly to the mexican government at all levels
the memorial and the above letter with additional proceedings of the meeting was presented to the ayuntamiento of bexar hoping that their fears and doubts about the purpose of the meeting would ease and they would join in the objects of the consultation
through the next several months the ayuntamiento of bexar represented by alcalde jose angel navarro expressed sympathy with the objectives but doubts of the utility of the consultation and its results and failed to overtly support it
although the municipality of gonzales was represented actively by henry brown and claiborne stinnett the gonzales ayuntamiento remained officially neutral through opinions delivered by alcalde ezekial williams
the convention established an action committee chaired by francis w. johnson with james b. miller as secretary
william h. wharton and don rafael manchola were appointed commissioners to saltillo and mexico city to present the memorials to the authorities
at first texans were encouraged by the response of jefe politico don jose m. de la garza in san antonio de bexar who wrote a letter to stephen f. austin containing the statement it can not be doubted that certain measures adopted by the government in regard to colonization were neither frank nor liberal
nor can it be doubted that abuses have been committed by military men in texas since 1830 nor that they have not been remedied and that the government of the state has in several instances been disregarded and insulted
the wish of every true patriot is to see the end of all such evils the country in peace and its happiness and progress uninterruptedly established
however at about the same time and unknown to texans at the time but found in historic archives years after to the governor of coahuila and texas la garza expressed the following and similar views in view of the actual state of affairs in this department i.e. all texas and especially of the peculiar situation of the district of nacogdoches in consequence of the determined and wide spread insurrection that took place in the north american settlements from the colorado to the sabine of which i informed your excellency by last mail a true mexican can but bitterly deplore his misfortune and feel sorely the foreign hand that came boldly to rob him of his rights employing physical force while even rational arguments from such a source ought hardly to be tolerated when we consider how lately these americans have been admitted to mexican citizenship
part of a letter of 8 nov also found in the mexican archives was to stephen f. austin with an enclosure to the san felipe ayuntamiento from ramon musquiz of bexar who would be the successor to garza as jefe politico
according to author john henry brown in history of texas:"musquiz informs the ayuntamiento that their action in regard to the convention was illegal and unwarranted by the constitution and existing laws and must be considered as derogatory to the supreme government that the step taken by them was in direct violation of the supreme order of january 10th 1824 which prohibits as dangerous all such popular meetings and gives it as his opinion musquiz that their conduct---'vindicates the wisdom of that supreme order he charges them with exercising powers that belong exclusively to the sovereign authority of the state that their actions were nullities hints at punishments and charges them forthwith to dissolve their standing and all subordinate committees
 col stephen f. austin the president of the first consulation replied san felipe nov. 15 1832esteemed friend i agree with the sentiment expressed in your appreciated letter of the 8th inst just received he is to be pitied who has the misfortune to be at the head of public affairs in revolutionary times but the only safe rule to follow is to do one 's duty regardless of the judgment of others
by this rule i have ever aimed to shape my actions and my conscience is at rest
on several occasions i have found myself begirt with weighty embarrassments but to the law of duty just mentioned as to a polar star i have looked for guidance and my aim has ever been to promote the true interests of the nation and of texas
with regard to the convention of which you speak i can assure you it did not originate with me but i am satisfied that some good will result from its action
already the public is better satisfied and we have bad more quiet than we had some time anterior thereto
as to your communication to the ayuntamiento in relation to the convention i believe that it would have been better not to have written it
revolutionary times are not like peaceable times
colonel bradburn could with the least prudence have avoided all the evils that like a pall have for some time mantled the country
i tell you candidly that in my opinion it would be very impolitic to translate and print your communication
i shall not do so
the ayuntamiento may do as they please
in times like the present any measure is bad that tends to irritate and produce excitement every measure is good that is calculated to soothe bind up and bring about tranquillity and good order
i have but little hope of obtaining anything from the government of mexico
there is little probability that we shall soon have a stable and peaceable order of public affairs and i give it as my deliberate judgment that texas is lost if she take no measure of her own for her welfare
i incline to the opinion that it is your duty as chief magistrate to call a general convention to take into consideration the condition of the country
i do not know how the state or general government can presume to say that the people of texas have violated the constitution when the acts of both governments have long since killed the constitution and when the confederation itself has hardly any life left
i can not approve the assertion that the people have not the right to assemble peaceably and calmly and respectfully represent their wants
in short the condition of texas is bad but we may fear to see it still worse
i am settling up all my affairs and in april i will go to the north for six months or a year
in texas things present no hopeful aspect but still when away i shall be glad to be informed how matters go on
i hope you will from time to time let me hear from you telling me of current events especially of such things as indicate the vitality or death of the constitution also as to whether or not a presidential election has occurred and what new hope may have sprung up as to an early and peaceful settlement of the affairs of our country
in the meanwhile please command your affectionate friend s.f. austin
little constructive frank and open response by the state or federal authorities at saltillo or further south in mexico to the memorial and appeals generated from the convention was observed by the colonists resulting in the call for a second convention
second consultation and convention san felipe de austin apr 1833
with the feeling that the central government or the government of coahuila and texas gave little or no serious consideration to the memorial from the first consultation presented to them a second convention composed of fifty six delegates a majority of whom had served as members of the first convention of 1832 was organized largely by william h. wharton president and thomas hastings secretary
the diverse opinions concerning strategy and objectives for texas emerged more clearly ranging from those who were for repeal of the bustamente decree of 1830 and tariff relief those for petitioning for independent statehood with assurance of loyalty to the government without a constitution and those for drafting a constitution with independence
among the latter were those favoring independence as a state within the republic of mexico and those for separation from mexico altogether
stephen f. austin was for petition for independent statehood but without drafting a constitution while william h. wharton who was elected president instead of austin for the consultation was for the latter course

committees largely with the same agenda as the first consultation were charged to prepare memorials to the federal government for the acceptance of the proposed constitution;for the organization of texas into a state of the federal mexican union;for
the repeal of the eleventh article of the decree of april 6 1830 forbidding the further immigration of north americans into texas;for tariff laws to encourage immigration agriculture and commerce
a constitution was drafted by a committee comprised of sam houston chairman nestor clay r. a. williamson james kerr oliver jones luke leassier and henry smith
it was thought to have primarily been written by houston who used extensively principles in the united states constitution with some articles clearly jacksonian and more radical than any state constitution
one hotly debated article successfully backed by houston banned banking institutions
david burnet who along with houston first appeared in texas politics at this consultation was charged with preparation of memorials to the mexican government for statehood
the petition for independent statehood was based on a decree of 7 may 1824 of the mexican congress so soon as texas shall be in a condition to figure as a state of itself it shall inform congress thereof for its resolution followed by the precise practical arguments of distance different interests dependence on coahuila economic potential and others
david b. edward in the history of texas published in 1836 prints the following two treatises as documents presented to the congress of the republic of mexico to the sovereign general congress of the republic of mexico
the inhabitants of all texas met in general convention at the town of san felipe de austin by means of delegates for the purpose of making known their wants to the government most respectfully represent that they desire the separation of texas from coahuila believing such separation indispensable to their mutual happiness and prosperity and that ultimately such division would produce the most happy results to the mexican republic
differences in coahuila and texas
coahuila being so far distant from the population of texas and so widely variant from it in interests the rights and wants of the people of texas can not be properly protected and provided for under the present organization admitting the several departments of the government of the state to be prompted by the utmost purity of intention in their efforts for the administration of justice
coahuila and texas are dissimilar in soil climate and productions in common interests and partly in population
the representatives of the former are numerous and those of the latter few in consequence of which any law passed peculiarly adapted for the benefit of texas has only to the effect of a generous courtesy
laws happily constructed for the benefit of coahuila and conducive to its best interests might be ruinous to texas such are the conflicting interests of the two countries for instance the unconstitutional law prohibiting any but native mexicans from retailing merchandise in those places not inhabited by american colonists to the exclusion of naturalized citizens from participation in that employment
security and settlement of aborigines
another reason which should interest the sympathies of the republic and enlist the aid of government in favor of texas is its locality being adjoining the territory of a powerful nation whose established policy towards the aborigines has a tendency to flood texas with indian emigrants of a character dangerous in the extreme
the wide extent of wilderness forming a natural boundary between texas and coahuila places an indispensable barrier in the way of coahuila 's extending the efficient means of defense she might wish
this circumstance alone demands that all the energies of texas should be embodied to prevent that calamity which threatens this favored country and which nothing short of a well regulated government of a free unshackled and independent state can provide against
be it known therefore that we the people of texas view with regret and concern the present unfortunate situation of the north american tribes of indians residing in texas and much deplore the transactions which have occasioned it
it is a well known fact that the cherokees claim by way of grant a tract of land situated about thirty miles to the northwest of nacogdoches which claim they have been told is worth about as much as the paper it is written on
the shawnees also to say nothing of those other tribes which have settled in the country and have been promised possessions
the promise is still protracted
when the indian inclined as he is to believe that a promise made eventually must be fulfilled becomes too frequently the dupe of craftiness and oppression he naturally becomes discontented unfriendly and hostile and in the present instance might be made more troublesome to as than those tribes which no concessions will mollify
the indians repeated request to obtain their rights are unattended to because an accredited agent of the government has been illegally suspended by a military officer of the last dynasty who in continuance of his system of deception and conciliation and with a view to enlist their aid declared to the cherokees at the time we began to evince a disposition of throwing from our necks the insupportable weight of military oppression)---"the americans grasping for land intend making the attempt of driving all my countrymen from this state and an extirpation of you all will soon follow
 but the conflict at an end we explained to them the true causes which impelled us to arms and they seeing a large number of our native mexican fellow citizens had taken up arms in our behalf seemingly became convinced that we fought for justice to ourselves and with respect for the rights of every indian
however unfortunately just at this time and while they were being told the government would put them in possession of their lands,-some of our fellow citizens without authority ran off and concluded in a survey part of the cherokee claim or grant consequently creating by such an act a distrustful disposition on the part of those indians in conjunction with all those unlawful acts so repeatedly committed on the poor confiding indians of texas who are thus made to believe that we are actuated by the same spirit as their former oppressors
therefore do they credit any gross misrepresentation made to them giving to former apprehensions the guise of truth and they are now losing past confidence in all individual protestations or advice like the wrecked bark which having crossed a wide expanse of ocean is in sight of her destined port but without the friendly sails that propelled her and without any visible aid or probable chance of assistance
under these indian circumstances alone we most respectfully solicit and entreat your most honorable body to consider that as a state we would be enabled to take such active measures in their behalf as would convince them that they could not with impunity be unlawfully or unjustly intruded upon humbly trusting that we could do such justice to their wishes in relation to lands as could not fail to assure them of our friendship and protection ---besides enlisting those north american tribes of indians among us in favor of the state and general government by securing to them a permanence of situation and enrolling them as brother citizens of that confederacy which they so much respect and regard
rights for independent state under constitution of 1824
for the above reasons and many others which the general congress will readily conceive and in view of the decree of the 7th of may 1824 allowing the people of texas so soon as their situation would permit to appear as a distinct state to report to congress for their resolution ---also in connection with the 11th section of the federal constitution guaranteeing them a representative in congress whatever may be their population and considering duly the benefits that would result both to texas and to the nation we entertain no doubts of the favorable reception of this petition
the people of texas present the strongest assurances of their patriotic attachment to the constitution and to the republic pledging all and every interest in life for the support of their declaration
tariff relief

the inhabitants of texas and so forth ---respectfully represent that the duties on articles of necessity to the inhabitants which are not and can not be manufactured in texas for several years to come are so high as to be equivalent to a total prohibition that many other articles which are prohibited by the tariff are of the first necessity to the settlers of texas
arid as the people of this section of the republic are yet almost without resources and are generally farmers who make their support by cultivating the land and have no manufacturing establishments yet erected within the limits of texas they respectfully petition the general government to grant for three years the privilege of introducing free of duty such articles as are indispensable to the prosperity of texas
among which this convention beg leave to enumerate the following to wit provisions iron and steel machinery farming utensils tools of the various mechanic arts hardware and hollowware nails waggons and carts cotton bagging and bale rope coarse cotton goods and clothing shoes and hats household and kitchen furniture tobacco for chewing in small quantities powder lead and shot medicines books and stationery
the foregoing articles include the principal imports made use of and wanted by the inhabitants of texas
many of them are prohibited and on those which are allowed to be introduced the duties are so high that they amount to a prohibition
the trade to texas is small and the resources limited but if fostered by a liberal policy on the part of the general government it will in a few years yield a revenue of no small importance
dr. james b. miller of san felipe a member of the convention and one of those chosen to present the results of the meeting to the congress of mexico informed the jefe politico at san antonio de bexar of the detailed proceedings and outcome of the meeting emphasizing:"the convention after long and mature deliberation on the important subject decided unanimously that the people of texas are in the condition prescribed by article two of the constitutive law of may 7 1824 which sets forth how and under what circumstances their province may have a state organization separate from and independent of coahuila and thereupon they addressed a petition to the general congress praying for the admission of texas as one of the states of the mexican confederation and to said petition attached the plan of a constitution for the state to be created
 dr. miller again quoted the law of 1824 under which statehood was justified coahuila and texas shall also form a state but as soon as texas shall be in a condition to form a state by itself it shall make a declaration to that effect to the congress for its further action
 complete detailed proceedings of this meeting were thought to have never been widely printed for distribution but lost in the destruction of san felipe by houston 's army in 1836
stephen f. austin james b. miller and erasmo seguin were appointed commissioners to present the proposed constitution to the authorities of mexico
austin however was the only one of the commissioners to go to mexico city where he found farias the vice president of mexico occupying the president 's chair and santa anna plotting to abandon the republicans overthrow the 1824 constitution and establish a centralist dictatorship
despite his extensive appeals sometimes in writing at request of acting president gomez farias minister of relations carlos garcia and minister of justice ramos arispe to understand the true positions of the colonists austin failed in obtaining consideration for statehood for texas separate from coahuila
he did succeed in obtaining modification of the law prohibiting immigration from the united states into texas
as he started home in december farias obtained information that austin had written to the people in bexar urging them to join in the petition for a separate texas government
farias ordered his arrest at saltillo and he was held for about 1.5 year without a trial or contact with friends and texas
upon his release in the summer of 1835 he returned home and found texas near a state of open rebellion in response to the consolidated of power by santa anna
at a meeting in brazoria its was agreed that another general consultation was necessary this time to more strongly assert constitutional rights and to prepare for the inevitable war with mexico
