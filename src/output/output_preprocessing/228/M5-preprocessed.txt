a us citizen from arkansas moses austin had acquired land in texas in 1820
in 1823 mexico confirmed this land grant and allowed austin 's son stephen f. austin to sell plots of land to settlers so long as they were of good character
stephen austin began advertising for settlers in frontier newspapers
and he had no trouble finding takers
the land could be bought for 12.5 cents an acre one tenth the cost of unwanted land in the united states
austin 's land was good for farming crops such as cotton sugar corn potatoes and fruit trees
word spread and from missouri arkansas kentucky and tennessee illinois and ohio people came to texas to buy land
mexico responded by applying new restrictions
foreigners could hold title to no more than 49,000 acres which amounts to land 8.7 by 8.7 miles
a head of a family could acquire 4,428 acres of land 2.6 by 2.6 miles for a fee of 30 dollars paid in installments of from four to six years
the alamo in 1828 president andrew jackson offered to buy texas but mexico refused his offer
austin 's migrants meanwhile were demonstrating that they were an industrious lot
many arrived with their own tools and machinery
most had some education and the migrants were setting up schools to educate their young
concerning texas mexico was handicapped by its gap between its elite and its poor
mexico 's elite had no desire to move to texas and take up farming
mexico 's poor did not see themselves as having an opportunity to succeed as farmers in texas
the total population of texas in 1829 was about 20,000 which left much of it still unsettled
there were about 1,000 slaves and about 5,000 mexicans
leaders in mexico city became worried about immigrants taking over texas and they considered settling convicts in texas or inviting catholic migrants from europe
in 1829 president guerrero abolished slavery in mexico 's territories as a way of discouraging yankee migration
in 1830 during the presidency of anastasio bustamante mexico 's congress passed a law prohibiting foreigners from settling on mexican territory unless they had a passport issued by mexico
mexico vowed strict enforcement of laws against a further introduction of slaves and it reimposed customs duties
mexico began actively encouraging mexicans and people from europe particularly from switzerland and germany to settle in texas
this upset the anglos there
they were concerned about preserving their own culture and their ability to express themselves politically including a demand that slavery be allowed
meanwhile mexico was in political turmoil again
president bustamante was unpopular in part because of the execution of vicente guerrero in february 1831
santa anna backed an uprising against bustamante in early 1832
liberals sided with santa anna seeing him as one of them the man who had proclaimed a republic back in 1822 and had defended mexico against the spanish
santa anna rode into mexico city in early january 1833
elections were held and santa anna won in a great landslide
a liberal valentín gómez farías became vice president
santa anna found the duties of the presidency burdensome and returned to the comforts of his estate while remaining officially president
presidential duties were left to the vice president and he began a bold move against conservative forces the army and the church
he reduced the size of the army and put the army under more restrictive governmental controls
he moved to secularize education and denied the church its right to collect an involuntary tithe leaving what people gave the church a matter of conscience
anglos in texas had cheered santa anna 's electoral success believing like others that he was a liberal
the anglos held a convention in 1833 at san felipe 130 miles east of san antonio attended by around 56 delegates
it called for mexico to repeal the anti immigration section of its law of april 6 1830
texas had been united with the state of coahuila back in 1824 and the convention called for texas to become an independent state within mexico
it called also for judicial reform habeas corpus trial by jury freedom of the press universal suffrage and improved mail service
the convention sent stephen austin to mexico city with their request for reform
on june 1 1833 mexico 's military led by general gabriél durán rebelled against vice president gómez farías and kidnapped santa anna declaring the great hero santa anna to be dictator
santa anna went over to the side of the conservatives and overthrew the government from which he had been absent
austin had arrived in mexico city in july and was received with hostility
on his way back to texas he was arrested in saltillo 70 kilometers southwest of monterrey and put in prison accused of inciting insurrection in texas
santa anna repealed the constitution of 1824 and in may 1834 he sent gómez farías into exile
for months santa anna 's military attacked in various states santa anna allowing his military freedom to intimidate any segment of society inclined to rebel
in july 1835 austin was freed under a general amnesty law and returned to the united states through new orleans but in texas the unrest continued
in november the anglo americans defied santa anna by voting to defend mexico 's 1824 constitution and volunteers began arriving from the united states to take part in a war against santa anna santa anna sent his brother in law general cós with 500 troops to texas to disarm the settlers and to expel troublemakers
 cós and company arrived in september 1835
fighting erupted and during the fighting in november the anglo americans created a document known as the organic law outlining a provisional government for texas
then in december on the outskirts of san antonio at a fortress in a place called the alamo a horde of armed anglo farmers defeated cós who surrendered
santa anna finished putting down a rebellion in the state of zacatecas
he led an army toward texas and he lost half of his more than 6,000 ill clad and ill fed men crossing desert through winter weather
in february he suddenly appeared in texas with an army of 3,000
when cós had surrendered to the anglos he had promised to take his men with him out of texas and fight the anglos no more but cós joined his few hundred men with those of santa anna
the military leader of the anglos sam houston was practical and advised fighters to abandon san antonio proclaiming that standing there was futile but a couple of hundred of them refused
they decided to hold up at the place of victory against cós the alamo
most of the anglos at the alamo followed the commander there colonel william travis and stayed to fight
santa anna raised a scarlet flag on the belfry of san antonio 's church indicating that he would not be granting mercy to any anglo who surrendered
among the anglos at the alamo words were spoken about fighting to the death
in the fighting that followed around 78 mexicans died 26 of them officers and 251 mexicans were wounded
only six of the 188 or so anglo men survived
santa anna provided the women and children at the alamo safe passage through his lines
he gave them protection a blanket and a little money for survival
the six who surrendered one of whom was davy crocket were cut down the following day with swords
crocket was a celebrity in the united states and people there wanted to believe that crockett had gone down fighting to the end
santa anna assumed that he had defeated the anglos of texas and he relaxed
he dispersed his army and ordered that all anglos caught bearing arms were to be executed as pirates and that expenses for his campaign were to be raised from confiscated property
one of his generals urrea ambushed 41 anglos at los cuantes de agua dulce and most of the 41 were killed with no casualties among urrea 's force
urrea captured 400 anglos near goliad 85 miles southeast of san antonio and he requested amnesty from santa anna
instead santa anna ordered all to be executed and the executions took place on march 27 1836
the anglos in texas meanwhile on march 2 had issued their declaration of independence
on april 20 santa anna now with a force of around 1,110 men met a force of 800 men led by sam houston near the san jacinto river on the eastern side of what is now the city of houston houston 's practicality regarding the alamo of living to fight another day paid off
houson 's force overwhelmed santa anna 's
while santa anna had been napping he was taken prisoner
some anglos wanted him killed
santa anna was unnerved and asked for and was given some opium
houston treated santa anna as a guest and he won from santa anna a pledge to end the fighting and to withdraw mexico 's army from texas
a second pledge by santa anna remained secret an agreement by santa anna to prepare mexico city to receive a peace delegation from texas for formal recognition of the independence of texas
one of santa anna 's generals obeyed santa anna and withdrew mexican military personnel from texas
in november 1836 houston allowed santa anna to travel to washington where santa anna met with president andrew jackson and a delegation from texas there during a dinner santa anna tried unassertively to sell texas to the united states at a bargain price but jackson was not buying
he saw texas as already independent of mexico and he sent santa anna back to vera cruz aboard a us warship
in 1837 the united states officially recognized texas as independent
mexico refused such recognition
france established a trade agreement with texas and recognized it as independent in 1839 trade agreements and recognition by great britain holland and belgium followed months later
