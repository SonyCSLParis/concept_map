san felipe de austin history san felipe de austin was founded in 1824 by stephen f. austin as the unofficial capital of his colony
it became the first urban center in the austin colony which stretched northward from the gulf of mexico as far as the old san antonio road and extended from the lavaca river in the west to the san jacinto river in the east
by october 1823 after briefly considering a location on the lower colorado river austin decided to establish his capital on the brazos river
the site chosen was on a high easily defensible bluff overlooking broad fertile bottomlands
the location offered a number of advantages including a central location and sources of fresh water independent of the brazos
although planned on the basis of the prevailing mexican town model with a regular grid of avenues and streets dominated by four large plazas the settlement soon began to sprawl westward from the brazos for more than a half mile
by 1828 the community comprised a population of about 200 three general stores two taverns a hotel a blacksmith shop and some forty or fifty log cabins
ten of the inhabitants were hispanic and the rest were of american or european origin males outnumbered females ten to one
the town was the social economic and political center of the austin colony
its expanding but unstable population was swelled by large numbers of immigrants and other transients
austin built a residence on bullinger 's creek a half mile west of the brazos from which he directed the government of his colony for four years before handing responsibility for the management of most affairs to the ayuntamiento the principal governing body of spanish municipalities of san felipe in 1828
the colonial land office was headquartered in the town and austin assumed an active role in its operation

its population in 1835 approached 600 and many more settlers resided nearby within the boundaries of the municipality

the conventions of 1832 and 1833 were held in the town and as the site of the consultation of november 3 1835 san felipe de austin served as the capital of the provisional government until the convention of 1836 met the following march at washington on the brazos

the terrified residents hastily gathered what few belongings they could carry before fleeing eastward during the incident known as the runaway scrape
by may 1836 as news of the texans victory at the battle of san jacinto spread residents began returning and a semblance of community life was soon restored near the original townsite
yet many families never returned and the government of the republic was unable to resume operation in the town due to the lack of necessary buildings
san felipe was incorporated in 1837 and became the county seat of the newly established austin county
though a courthouse was constructed the town never recovered its former stature
by the mid-1840s the only other buildings in the settlement were six or seven log houses and a tavern
in 1846 a county election made the new community of bellville the county seat and the removal of administrative functions from san felipe was completed in january 1848
