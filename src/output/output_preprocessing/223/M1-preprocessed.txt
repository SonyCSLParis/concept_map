byzantine empire the origins of the great civilization known as the byzantine empire can be traced to 330 a.d. when the roman emperor constantine i dedicated a new rome on the site of the ancient greek colony of byzantium
though the western half of the roman empire crumbled and fell in 476 the eastern half survived for 1,000 more years spawning a rich tradition of art literature and learning and serving as a military buffer between the states of europe and the threat of invasion from asia
the byzantine empire finally fell in 1453 after an ottoman army stormed constantinople during the reign of constantine xi
a new rome the term byzantine derives from byzantium an ancient greek colony founded by a man named byzas
located on the european side of the bosporus the strait linking the black sea to the mediterranean the site of byzantium was ideally located to serve as a transit and trade point between europe and asia minor
in 330 a.d. roman emperor constantine i chose byzantium as the site of a new roman capital constantinople
five years earlier at the council of nicaea constantine had established christianity once an obscure jewish sect as rome ’s official religion
the citizens of constantinople and the rest of the eastern roman empire identified strongly as romans and christians though many of them spoke greek and not latin
did you know
one of the most extraordinary aspects of the byzantine empire was its longevity it was the only organized state west of china to survive without interruption from ancient times until the beginning of the modern age
though constantine ruled over a unified roman empire this unity proved illusory after his death in 337
in 364 emperor valentinian i again divided the empire into western and eastern sections putting himself in power in the west and his brother valens in the east
the fate of the two regions diverged greatly over the next several centuries
in the west constant attacks from german invaders such as the visigoths broke the struggling empire down piece by piece until italy was the only territory left under roman control
in 476 the barbarian odoacer overthrew the last roman emperor romulus augustus and rome had fallen
survival of the byzantine empire the eastern half of the roman empire proved less vulnerable to external attack thanks in part to its geographic location
with constantinople located on a strait it was extremely difficult to breach the capital ’s defenses in addition the eastern empire had a much shorter common frontier with europe
it also benefited greatly from a stronger administrative center and internal political stability as well as great wealth compared with other states of the early medieval period
the eastern emperors were able to exert more control over the empire ’s economic resources and more effectively muster sufficient manpower to combat invasion
as a result of these advantages the eastern roman empire variously known as the byzantine empire or byzantium was able to survive for centuries after the fall of rome
though byzantium was ruled by roman law and roman political institutions and its official language was latin greek was also widely spoken and students received education in greek history literature and culture
in terms of religion the council of chalcedon in 451 officially established the division of the christian world into five patriarchates each ruled by a patriarch rome where the patriarch would later call himself pope constantinople alexandria antioch and jerusalem
the byzantine emperor was the patriarch of constantinople and the head of both church and state
after the islamic empire absorbed alexandria antioch and jerusalem in the seventh century the byzantine emperor would become the spiritual leader of most eastern christians
the byzantine empire under justinian justinian i who took power in 527 and would rule until his death in 565 was the first great ruler of the byzantine empire
during the years of his reign the empire included most of the land surrounding the mediterranean sea as justinian ’s armies conquered part of the former western roman empire including north africa
many great monuments of the empire would be built under justinian including the domed church of holy wisdom or hagia sophia 532 37 a.d.
justinian also reformed and codified roman law establishing a byzantine legal code that would endure for centuries and help shape the modern concept of the state
at the time of justinian ’s death the byzantine empire reigned supreme as the largest and most powerful state in europe
debts incurred through war had left the empire in dire financial straits however and his successors were forced to heavily tax byzantine citizens in order to keep the empire afloat
in addition the imperial army was stretched too thin and would struggle in vain to maintain the territory conquered during justinian ’s rule
during the seventh and eighth centuries attacks by persians and slavs combined with internal political instability and economic regression threatened the empire
a new even more serious threat arose in the form of islam founded by the prophet muhammad in mecca in 622
in 634 muslim armies began their assault on the byzantine empire by storming into syria
by the end of the century byzantium would lose syria the holy land egypt and north africa among other territories to islamic forces
from iconoclasm to monasticism during the eighth and early ninth centuries byzantine emperors beginning with leo iii in 730 spearheaded a movement that denied the holiness of icons or religious images and prohibited their worship or veneration
known as iconoclasm literally the smashing of images”–the movement waxed and waned under various rulers but did not end definitively until 843 when a church council under emperor michael iii ruled in favor of the display of religious images
during the late 10th and early 11th centuries under the rule of the macedonian dynasty founded by michael iii ’s successor basil the byzantine empire enjoyed a golden age
though it stretched over less territory byzantium had more control over trade more wealth and more international prestige than under justinian
the strong imperial government patronized the arts restored churches palaces and other cultural institutions and promoted the study of ancient greek history and literature
greek became the official language of the state and a flourishing culture of monasticism centered on mount athos in northeastern greece
monks administered many institutions orphanages schools hospitals in everyday life and byzantine missionaries won many converts to christianity among the slavic peoples of the central and eastern balkans including bulgaria and serbia and russia
byzantium and the crusades the end of the 11th century saw the beginning of the crusades the series of holy wars waged by western christians against muslims in the near east from 1095 to 1291
with the seijuk turks of central asia bearing down on constantinople emperor alexius i turned to the west for help resulting in the declaration of holy war by pope urban ii at clermont france that began the first crusade
as armies from france germany and italy poured into byzantium alexius tried to force their leaders to swear an oath of loyalty to him in order to guarantee that land regained from the turks would be restored to his empire
after western and byzantine forces recaptured nicaea in asia minor from the turks alexius and his army retreated drawing accusations of betrayal from the crusaders
during the subsequent crusades animosity continued to build between byzantium and the west culminating in the conquest and looting of constantinople during the fourth crusade in 1204
the latin regime established in constantinople existed on shaky ground due to the open hostility of the city ’s population and its lack of money
many refugees from constantinople fled to nicaea site of a byzantine government in exile that would retake the capital and overthrow latin rule in 1261
the fall of the byzantine empire its legacy during the rule of the palaiologan emperors beginning with michael viii in 1261 the economy of the once mighty byzantine state was crippled and never regained its former stature
in 1369 emperor john v unsuccessfully sought financial help from the west to confront the growing turkish threat but was arrested as an insolvent debtor in venice
four years later he was forced like the serbian princes and the ruler of bulgaria to become a vassal of the mighty turks
as a vassal state byzantium paid tribute to the sultan and provided him with military support
under john ’s successors the empire gained sporadic relief from ottoman oppression but the rise of murad ii as sultan in 1421 marked the end of the final respite
murad revoked all privileges given to the byzantines and laid siege to constantinople his successor mehmed ii completed this process when he launched the final attack on the city
on may 29 1453 after an ottoman army stormed constantinople mehmed triumphantly entered the hagia sophia which would become the city ’s leading mosque
emperor constantine xi died in battle that day and the decline and fall of the byzantine empire was complete
in the centuries leading up to the final ottoman conquest in 1453 the culture of the byzantine empire including literature art and theology flourished once again even as the empire itself faltered
byzantine culture would exert a great influence on the western intellectual tradition as scholars of the italian renaissance sought help from byzantine scholars in translating greek pagan and christian writings
this process would continue after 1453 when many of these scholars fled to italy from constantinople
long after its end byzantine culture and civilization continued to exercise an influence on countries that practiced its orthodox religion including russia romania bulgaria serbia and greece among others
