warfare in the balkans 500ad to 1000adthe dark ages or early middle ages confirmed the increasing importance of cavalry in conjunction with the bow even in the balkans with its wooded mountainous terrain
the region was dominated by the byzantine empire which sought to resist new barbarian invasions from north of the danube
however by the end of this period these invaders had established themselves in the balkans
bulgars slavs avars 500 600new barbarian tribes the bulgars and the slavs were pushed south into the balkans by the avars
the slavs began to infiltrate the balkans around 500
they came in small groups first to raid and later to settle in fortified earthworks called grads eg modern belgrade
each clan was lead by a zupan
these were grouped into tribes with chieftains called voivodes or grand zupan
early slav armies consisted almost entirely of javelin armed infantry with some archers and other ill armed peasants
as they became more settled the chieftains developed a small retinue of cavalry called druzhinas
militarily they were most effective in broken terrain and when allied with bulgars or avars who provided a strong cavalry element
despite reverses such as sardica sofia in 550 they occupied most of the balkans by the end of the century
the bulgars in contrast were asiatic horseman related to the huns
the core of their armies consisted of heavy noble cavalry supported by swarms of light horse archers
in the 6th century they were subjects of the avars who had absorbed the remnants of the huns
their raids reached constantinople in 559 when belisarius was brought out of retirement to force them back from thrace
the avars were heavy bow armed cavalry who after initially being paid by justinian to attack the slavs allied themselves with the balkan slavs gepids and bulgars to ravage the balkans
under the great chief bayan they reached as far south as the aegean in 591
they were finally defeated in a series of battles on the danube at viminacium by the emperor maurice in 601
the mobility of the avars and their allies being negated by disciplined squares of byzantine troops1
whilst the avars bulgars and slavs occupied the balkans the byzantine empire reached its greatest extent under justinian 527 565
byzantine armies under belisarius and narses fought successful wars against the ostrogoths in italy the vandals in africa and the persians
byzantine empire 602 800the byzantine empire spent the 7th century on the defensive in the balkans while it fought most of its wars in the east resisting sassanid and then arab invasions
the avars regularly swept through the balkans with peace being bought with tribute
in 626 a 100,000 strong avar army including slavs and bulgars invested constantinople in conjunction with the persians
in a desperate siege the emperor heraclius fought off the combined assaults
he went on to save the empire defeating the sassanids at nineveh in 627
in the later 7th and 8th centuries the empire was limited to the coastal regions and thrace largely due to arab invasions from the east which culminated in yet another epic siege of constantinople in 717
byzantine organisation and tactics the normal tactical formation was based on two defensive infantry lines consisting of heavy infantry skoutatoi with light bow armed psiloi on the flanks
they resisted enemy attacks whilst the heavy cavalry protected the flanks and then delivered counter attacks enveloping the enemy line
the slavs occupied illyricum macedonia and greece as semi independent tribes eventually throwing off avar control
four distinct groups developed slovenes croats serbs and those who intermixed with the bulgars
intermittent wars with the byzantines continued throughout the century
emperors came to accept that the tide of slav tribes could not be halted and therefore negotiated treaties and sent punitive expeditions into the balkans when agreements were broken or dues not paid
unlike the asiatic nomads the slavs transformed themselves from marauders to settlers
the original settlers did not disappear
the illyrians were forced westward into the mountains of albania and the greeks south to modern greece and the islands
the latin speaking provincials were forced to the uplands preserving a degree of individuality reflected to this day in modern romania
the franks made some inroads into the western fringes of the balkans assisting both the byzantines and slavs by destroying the avars by the end of the 8th century
bulgariathe bulgars established an independent kingdom between the balkan mountains and the lower danube plus parts of modern day romania under isperich 643 701
under terbelis they defeated the byzantines at anchialus 708
there was a brief alliance with byzantium in 718 when a bulgarian army helped defeat the invading arab armies at adrianople
constantine v gained the upper hand in the wars of 755 772 with victories at marcellae 759 and anchialus 763
however by the end of the century kardam of the bulgars was once again forcing byzantium to pay tribute
the army of this period relied heavily on slav infantry armed with either javelin or bow
usually only a third of the force would be the effective bulgar cavalry
the 9th century bulgars under khan krum raided westwards into croatia and serbia as well as southwards
emperor nicephorus sacked the bulgar capital of pliska in 811 before being trapped in a mountain pass dying with his army
in 813 krum besieged constantinople after defeating another byzantine army at versinikia but without a fleet he was powerless to capture the city
after krums death his son omortag was defeated at the battle of mesembria 817 by leo v and the bulgars agreed to a thirty year peace
in 866 emperor michael iii and his uncle bardas invaded bulgaria
bulgarian king boris i 852 889 was forced to accept christianity and was unsuccessful in attempts to expand westwards into croatia and serbia
his second son symeon 893 927 fought a series of wars with the byzantine empire gaining macedonia thessaly and albania
in 895 he allied with the pechenegs another nomadic race of horse archers defeating the magyars in the north before turning south to defeat the byzantines driving them to the gates of constantinople
he finally brought serbia under bulgar control in 918 although he failed in croatia
however in the north he lost transylvania and pannonia to the magyars and wallachia to the pechenegs
after symeon 's death the bulgar state declined
in 967 69 a concerted invasion by the byzantines from the south and the russians by sea overran the country
the invaders fell out over the spoils and a victorious byzantine empire battles of arcadioplois 970 and dorostalon 971 annexed all of eastern bulgaria up to the danube in 972
the serbs also revolted and the magyars raided southwards at will
samuel 976 1014 re established the bulgarian state in 976 and defeated an invading byzantine army near sofia in 981
he went on to occupy all of thessaly by 989
samuel established himself in macedonia around the great lakes ochrid and prespa with fortifications and a mobile field army
byzantine emperor basil ii returned from his difficulties with the arabs to capture eastern bulgaria and then defeating samuel at spercheios 996 recovering greece and macedonia
samuel counter attacked and the war continued until the decisive battle of balathista macedonia 1014 where a fortified bulgar army in the kleidon pass was surprised by a byzantine force which traversed the mountains
after the battle basil blinded 15,000 captives earning himself the title basil the bulgar slayer
samuel died of shock when the captives returned home
basil went on to capture the macedonian forts and bulgaria became a byzantine province for the next 168 years2
the magyars the magyars or hungarians were the last steppe peoples to settle in the balkans
unlike most of the steppe tribes previously described the magyars belonged to the finno ugric language group rather than turkic or mongol
however they were still mounted archers and their method of warfare was similar to the huns and avars who preceded them
the magyars were driven from the steppe by the pechenegs3 and established themselves in hungary from 899 under their chieftain arpad driving the slavs south out of the danube valley
their main invasion effort concentrated on germany
for more than a century they invaded northern italy germany and france until their decisive defeat at the battle of lechfeld in 955
as the poet bishop liutprand exclaimed no man ever wished more desperately for food or water than these savages desire a fight their only joy is in battle
after lechfeld hungary became a settled european state converted to christianity by bavarian missionaries
serbiathe slav tribes west of the bulgars known as serbs coalesced as a state in the 9th century
they acknowledged the suzerainty of the byzantines and were converted to christianity by the missionary work of cyril and others
their loose affiliation to the empire was insufficient to fend off the bulgars
conquered by symeon of bulgaria in 918 there was a brief period of independence under prince chaslav in 931 before again being conquered by the bulgars
the serbs did not regain autonomy until the 11th century
croatiato the west of the serbs were found another slav tribal group the croats
although the original croats were probably iranian and became assimilated by the slavs
the croats original twelve tribes were invited to occupy lands in dalmatia under byzantine rule as confirmed in a treaty in 678
in the 9th and early 10th centuries croatia was overrun at different times by franks moravians bulgars magyars and the byzantines
the franks held most of slavonia and croatia following the peace of aachen 812 with the byzantines retaining the coastal towns of dalmatia4
at this time both of the croatian dukes converted to christianity
duke trpimir 845 864 gained considerable autonomy from the western empire and defeated a byzantine army in 846
at the end of his reign the croats came under the religious sway of rome dividing them from their slavic cousins to the east
after internal squabbles duke branimir gained papal recognition as the first independent ruler of croatia in 879
the new state fought off the growing strength of venice and although slavonia was overrun by the magyars duke tomislav held them off establishing the kingdom of the croats in 925
this state probably included modern croatia slavonia and much of northern and western bosnia including the dalmation coast
the settled state was rocked by civil war in 949 losing bosnia to the serbs and control of the dalmatian towns to venice
drzislav 969 997 supported the byzantines against the bulgars and was recognised as an independent monarch in 988
conclusionthe dark ages in the balkans were dominated by the invasions from the steppes
whilst on some occasions the effects were transitory other groups established themselves permanently
the outline of the modern balkans can be seen with the establishment of the states of croatia serbia and bulgaria
the byzantine empire was the dominant influence on the balkans particularly in the south and at the end of this period was in revival
