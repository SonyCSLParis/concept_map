chapter 7 late antiquity 350 600chapter outline
the byzantine empire originsdespite the efforts of constantine and justinian the unity of the roman empire could not be maintained
byzantium endured assaults by the germanic tribes the persians the nomadic huns bulgars and avars and the arabs
sources of byzantine strength strong military leadership the strong fortifications of constantinople the law code of justinian the legal code of justinian was a significant contribution to the early middle ages
the corpus juris civilis consisting of the code the digest and the institutes is the foundation of european law
byzantine intellectual life byzantine intellectual life was a stimulant for the west
the byzantines kept learning alive in the east
they passed greco roman culture on to the arabs
byzantine science and medicine in mathematics and geometry the byzantines discovered little that was new making advances in science only when science could be put to military uses
byzantine medicine was far more advanced than that of the medieval west
it was based largely on the classical and hellenistic physicians writings
greek medical science was not equal to the challenge of the justinian plague that afflicted the empire between 542 and 560
by the ninth or tenth century most major greek cities had hospitals
the growth of the christian church the idea of a church after the legalization of christianity by the emperor constantine the words christian church originally applied to the officials who ministered to christians
in early christian communities local people elected their leaders called bishops
the bishops of rome used the petrine doctrine to support the case for their authority over other christian bishops
the church and the roman emperors constantine legalized christianity in a.d 312
he embarked on an extensive church building project
in 380 theodosius made christianity the religion of the state
the arian heresy challenged the foundation of the church
the council of nicaea was held in 325 to combat the arians
the council produced the nicene creed the doctrine that christ was of the same substance as god
the nicene creed became christian orthodoxy
bishop ambrose formulated the theory that the church was separate from and superior to the state
byzantine emperors played an active role in church affairs
the orthodox church was less independent of secular control than the western christian church
bishops and the pope leadership in the early church was creative and inspirational
many talented romans such as ambrose became leaders in the early church
the church adopted rome ’s diocesan system
bishops presided over the various dioceses
the bishops of rome claimed to speak and act as the source of unity for all christians
in the fifth century the bishops of rome began to stress their supremacy over other christian communities
the development of christian monasticism st. anthony an ascetic monk who disdained communal urban existence personified the early eremitical life in the egyptian desert
saint basil opposed the eremitical life and encouraged instead coenobitic monasticism
western and eastern monasticism monasticism in the west tended to be communal or coenobitic
st. benedict of nursia developed the guide for all christian monastic life
the rule of st. benedict was influenced by earlier monastic codes
benedict ’s rule outlined a life of discipline and moderation
monks made a vow of stability conversion of manners and obedience
benedictine monasticism succeeded because of its emphasis on the balanced life and because it suited the social circumstances of the early middle ages
st. basil composed a set of regulations called the long rules that were for communities of economically self sufficient monks and nuns
monasteries spread throughout the byzantine empire
financial assistance from the emperor justinian 527–565 helped
orthodox monasticism came to differ from western monasticism
st. benedict 's rules came to dominate in the west but in greek orthodoxy each monastery had its own rules
while western monks generally stayed at one monastery orthodox monks frequently moved from one to another
in the west monasteries provided education while those in the orthodox world generally did not
christian ideas and practices christianity and classical culture
the early christians were hostile to pagan culture
saint jerome incorporated pagan thought into christianity
christian notions of gender and sexuality despite jesus treatment of women more or less as equals to men christianity absorbed the classical world 's disdain for women
women took an active role in the spread of early christianity
the church came to consider sex and sexual desire to be evil
saint augustine on human nature will and sin augustine of hippo a.d 354–430 had a tremendous impact on early christianity
he was the most important leader of early medieval christianity
his confessions delineated the pre christian struggles of the author
his city of god established the historical philosophical base of a new christian worldview
christian missionaries and conversion missionaries on the continent early medieval christianity conducted extensive missionary work
martin of tours brought christianity to gaul
in eastern europe missionaries traveled far beyond the boundaries of the byzantine empire
christianity in the british isles st. patrick took christianity to ireland
pope gregory i sent augustine to convert the britons
the roman brand of christianity won out over its celtic rival at the synod of whitby in 664 conversion and assimilation germanic assimilation into christianity was slow as the moral code of christianity made little sense to germanic warriors who valued physical strength and battlefield courage
priests used manuals called penitentials to teach people christian virtues
the rite of private confession was part of this process
in many areas the church practiced assimilation of local cultures seeking to turn pagan temples into churches and to substitute christian festivals for pagan festivals that occurred at about the same time of year
migrating peoples the idea of the barbarian the greeks and the romans invented the idea of the barbarian
for the romans these were peoples living outside the empire 's frontiers peoples without history
some germanic peoples identities were shaped by a militarily successful family
central asian steppe peoples such as the huns and the avars were loose confederations of steppe warriors
the alamanni and the slavs were loosely organized short lived bands of peoples who lacked central leadership
celts germans and huns both celts and germans practiced three field crop rotation and used the wheeled plow
the celts were accomplished ironworkers as were the germans
the germans consisted of a number of different groups none numbering more than 100,000
german migrations and pressure on the rhine danube frontier of the roman empire may have been due simply to constant warfare or to the opportunities for service and work for pay around roman camps
one significant factor in germanic migration was pressure from nomadic steppe peoples from central asia most prominently the huns
germanic kingdoms between 450 and 565 the germans established a number of short lived kingdoms
the kingdom of the franks proved the most powerful and enduring of all the barbarian kingdoms
anglo saxon england the anglo saxons achieved a model germanic state
after roman withdrawal from britannium germanic invaders angles saxons and jutes drove the native celtic britons west to wales and brittany and north to scotland
the legends of king arthur and his court represent the celtic resistance to the anglo saxons
by the seventh and eighth centuries there were seven germanic kingdoms known as the anglo saxon heptarchy
they were united under alfred the great in the ninth century
barbarian society kinship custom and class members of a german folk or tribe believed that they were all descended from a common ancestor
each tribe had its own laws and customs passed down by word of mouth
the war chieftain led the tribe
the comitatus warband that fought with the chief gradually become a warrior nobility
lawin the late sixth century german kings encouraged by christian missionaries began to have their laws written down
germanic law was a system of fines paid by the perpetrator to the victim ’s family and was designed to control violence not achieve justice
social and economic structures
the germanic tribes lived in small villages
warfare was endemic in this kind of society
males engaged in animal husbandry and women grew grain
widows inherited their husbands rights and some royal women exercised considerable political control
germanic society was patriarchal
