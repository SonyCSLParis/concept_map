constantine the great 272 to 337 adconstantine i constantine the great was a roman emperor proclaimed augustus by his troops in 206
constantine rebuilt the city of byzantium and renamed the city nova roma new rome providing it with a senate and civic offices similar to the older rome
he earned his place as ruler of the roman empire by defeating maxentius at the battle of milvian bridge in 312
following this he became western augustus ruler of the entire western roman empire until his death in 337
he is best remembered for being the first roman emperor to embrace christianity
he is also remembered for issuing the edict of milan in 313 which fully legalized christianity in the roman empire for the first time
he also presided over the council of nicaea in 325
these actions are considered major factors in the spread of christianity
the byzantine empire constantinople was built on the site of an ancient greek trading city called byzantium
it lay near both the black sea and the mediterranean sea
the location protected the city form attacks and let the city control trade between europe and asia
it was an ideal place to grow in wealth and power
after rome fell in 476 the emperors of the eastern roman empire dreamed of taking it back and reuniting the old roman empire
an emperor who ruled from 527 to 565 justinian reuniting the empire was his passion
he sent his army to retake italy
the army conquered not only italy but also much land around the mediterranean
justinian was just as passionate about the law and the church
he tasked his officials to examine all rome 's laws and remove any out of date or unchristian laws
then he organized the laws into a legal system called the justinian 's code guaranteeing fair treatment for all his citizens
along the way justinian made many enemies
two groups joined forces and tried to overthrow him
this caused riots in the streets and fires to be set to many of the buildings
justinian prepared to leave constantinople
theodora justinian 's wife was smart and powerful and convinced him to stay
together they ended the riots and saved the emperor 's throne although justinian 's soldiers killed 30,000 rioting people
after the death of justinian in 565 the empire began to decline
invasions from barbarians persians and muslims the later emperors lost all the land justinian gained
even though the empire remained a major power for several years it never regained its former strength
in 1453 the ottoman turks captured constantinople thus bringing the 1,000 year roman empire to an end
justinian was the last roman emperor of the eastern empire
after he died non roman influences took hold throughout the empire
people began speaking greek from the eastern empire rather than latin
scholars studied greek not roman philosophy
the empire lost its ties to the old roman empire and a new society developed
the people thought of themselves as romans but they were actually of the byzantine empire named after a greek town of byzantium
one reason the eastern and western societies were different was the byzantines interaction with other groups
because constantinople 's location was between europe and asia it was an ideal location for trade
merchants from all around europe asia and africa traveled to constantinople for trade
over time the byzantine society began to reflect these outside influences as well as the roman and greek roots
byzantine emperors held more power than the western emperors did
they liked to show off their great power
the power of an eastern emperor was greater because the emperor was considered the head of the church as well as the political leader
the byzantines thought the emperor was chosen by god to lead both the empire and the church
in the west the emperor was limited to political power popes and bishops were the leaders of the church
nearly all who lived in the byzantine empire were christian
christianity was central to the byzantine 's lives
byzantine artists created beautiful works of religious art to show devotion to god and the christian church
the grandest of all were mosaics made of pieces of colored stone or glass some sparkled with gold silver and jewels
more magnificent than the works of art were the churches especially the hagia sophia
built by justinian in the 530s the church has huge domes which rose high above constantinople
legend says when justinian saw the church he exclaimed glory to god who has judged me worthy of accomplishing such a work as this
o solomon i have outdone you 
in time eastern and western christianity presented differently
eastern priests could marry while western could not
services in the east were performed in greek the west was in latin
although christianity was viewed differently between east and west the leaders worked together in spite of the views
in the 1000s christianity in the east broke away from the rest of the church and formed what later became known as the eastern orthodox church
as a result eastern and western europe were completely divided
