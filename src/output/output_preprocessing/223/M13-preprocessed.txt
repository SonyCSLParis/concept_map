the byzantine sassanid war 602 628 the final and most significant of the many wars between the byzantine and sassanid empires was fought from 602 to 628
after a decade a peace khosrau ii resumed hostilities between the old adversaries
but only after the death of his ally emperor maurice
the byzantine emperor had helped khosrau regain the throne of the sassanid empire in 591 and the two remained friends until maurice was executed by phocas in 602
in that same year khosrau invaded byzantine land seemingly to avenge maurice 's death
no doubt though he also had visions of reclaiming land lost to the byzantines in the past
the pretext for invasion came when narses governor of mesopotamia rebelled against phocas and declared independence from the byzantines
phocas responded by dispatching his general germanus to edessa the region 's capital
narses in turn appealed to khorsau for help
it was just the excuse khosrau needed
and so he sent an army under the command of kardarigan to relieve the siege of edessa
the persian counter attack was successful and germanus was killed in the battle
phocas responded with another army this time focused on driving the sassanid army back to persia
but it was defeated at dara
and so it went in the early years of the war the sassanids had several early successes
these successes were compounded by more rebellions which broke out in the byzantine empire from provinces which tried to take advantage of the situation
west africa syria and palestine all tried to break away from constantinople 's control
phocas hardly had the troops to fight both the sassanids and put down the rebellions flaring up all over his kingdom
the border between the two empires was ever changing and khosrau managed to capture several frontier towns with minimal resistance
byzantine sassanid war 602 628)a major shift occurred in 610 when the exarch of africa one of the leaders in rebellion a man named heraclius the elder sent an army to egypt led by his nephew nicetas and defeated the byzantine army under the command of bonosus
phocas was in dire straights now as his empire was under attack from both the east and south
meanwhile heralcius son heraclius the younger sailed with yet another army directly on constantinople
phocas troops were so thinly spread that he could only muster the palace guard to oppose him
and it defected to heraclius
they were so badly outnumbered and phocas had become so unpopular they likely saw this as the best course of action
heraclius the younger entered the city virtually unopposed executed phocas on the spot and made himself emperor
now the sassanid empire faced a new emperor and heraclius immediately tried to sue for peace with khosrau ii
after all khosrau had attacked the byzantines under the pretext that phocas had overthrown his friend maurice eight years earlier
now phocas was dead and heraclius figured there was no more need for war
but khosrau refused the offer clearly demonstrating that his goal all along was to expand his empire
and why not
the byzantine government was in disarray and the sassanids were having success everywhere they fought
and it continued in the near term
in 612 the persian army under the command of general shahrbaraz conquered syria cutting the byzantine empire in half
after fortifying its position against an attack from the north it turned south and headed for jerusalem
a large jewish force supplemented the army and jerusalem was a highly sought prize
the march took three weeks and some of the heaviest casualties occurred at this time
between the trek and the assault on the city some 75,000 people died total on both sides and another 35,000 were enslaved
but in the end jerusalem fell in 613 to the sassanid empire
after that a five year lull interrupted the war
the byzantines were still not ready to offer any serious opposition and the sassanids paused to consolidate their position
but in 618 they were on the move again
emperor heraclius cousin nicetas was still in charge of egypt and that was shahrbaraz 's next target
which he captured after a year long siege of alexandria
after that khosrau sent the following letter to heraclius urging him to surrender:"khosrau greatest of gods and master of the earth to heraclius his vile and insensate slave
why do you still refuse to submit to our rule and call yourself a king
have i not destroyed the greeks
you say that you trust in your god
why has he not delivered out of my hand caesarea jerusalem and alexandria
and shall i not also destroy constantinople
but i will pardon your faults if you submit to me and come hither with your wife and children and i will give you lands vineyards and olive groves and look upon you with a kindly aspect
do not deceive yourself with vain hope in that christ who was not able to save himself from the jews who killed him by nailing him to a cross
even if you take refuge in the depths of the sea i will stretch out my hand and take you whether you will or no heraclius refused to submit but his situation was desperate and so made a desperate attempt to turn the outcome in his favor
the first problem was that the war had bankrupted the empire and he needed funds to raise and equip a new army
so he devalued the currency stripped constantinople of as many riches as he could and declared it the duty of every able bodied man to fight
new recruits joined with payment of half wages but the promise of land grants if reclaimed from the persians
heraclius had achieved his first goal of building an army
and then he chose to command it himself which was almost unheard of for a byzantine emperor
by 622 he was ready and marched from the city leaving his son heraclius constantine in charge as regent
heraclius was considered a very able military leader and demonstrated it by moving his army to cappadocia in between the sassanid army and its capital of ctesiphon thereby cutting off shahrbaraz 's supply lines and communications with the empire
shahrbaraz had no choice but to turn back and attack heraclius
the details of the battle are lost but heraclius won a smashing victory over shahrbaraz
finally the byzantines got the win they needed
byzantine sassanid war 602 628)but their problems were not over
the empire 's old nemeses the avars and slavs see emperor maurice decided to take advantage of the situation and poured across the northern border raiding byzantine lands
heraclius could not afford to divert attention away from the sassanids and so had little choice but to buy them off
he paid a tribute of 200,000 solidi gold coins in exchange for their departure
it was the only option he had
his army was already deployed in the east and he needed it at full strength to try to end the war
once again heraclius offered to make peace with khosrau as he had when he first became emperor
unlike that first time he had an army on the sassanid border and threatened to invade if khosrau refused
khosrau refused anyway apparently confident that one defeat would not offset ultimate victory
so heraclius invaded in 624
not only that but he invaded with reckless abandon ignoring his rear which meant supplying his army with whatever provisions he could gather along the way
he had an estimated 40,000 men and his goal was to strike quickly
traveling east along the araxes river fresh water through armenia he captured every sassanid town in his path
heraclius was deep inside sassanid territory before khosrau finally managed to send an army about the same size as the byzantine to stop him
they met at ganzaka
events are sketchy but it seems heraclius managed to use arab soldiers to capture and kill several of khosrau 's elite guard which had the effect of demoralizing the sassanid army
and again heraclius was victorious
he marked his victory by destroying the zoroastrian fire temple of takht e solyman which means throne of solomon
outraged khosrau deployed three separate armies to hunt down and destroy the invaders
since they were traveling through the foothills of the caucus mountains the three sassanid armies moved to cut off any route of retreat for the byzantines
but despite being outnumbered heraclius had no intention of retreating
instead he came up with a plan to even the odds
he sent two soldiers who pretended to be deserters to the army led by shahraplakan
they claimed to be fleeing due to a devastating attack at the hands of shahin the commander of one of the other armies
if there 's any law that exists for military leaders it 's that they all want their share of glory for a great victory in battle
and so shahraplakan rushed his men to take part in the attack so he could receive his accolades
but what he rushed into was an ambush at tigranakert
meanwhile he used the same ruse on the army of shahin which arrived shortly after the battle with shahraplakan
both persian armies were routed
that left a final army led by shahrbaraz whom had met heraclius back in 622
survivors of the first two armies who managed to escape joined up with shahrbaraz 's army and it pursued the byzantines
heraclius crossed the araxes river and camped in a plain on the side opposite shahrbaraz
shahrbaraz reached a town called aliovit and decided to split his forces
he sent 6,000 men across the river to ambush the byzantines
but heraclius was one step ahead
while shahrbaraz was sending his 6,000 troops to attack the byzantines heraclius was doubling back to attack the main sassanid army at aliovit at night
he destroyed it in 625
heraclius demonstrated superior tactics in his campaign defeating four sassanid generals one of them shahrbaraz who had achieved his own success early in the war while in enemy territory
unable to remain there though without a supply line he began his retreat back west later in the same year
shahrbaraz who survived the attack on aliovit was given another army either he still had khosrau 's trust or khosrau had no one else to turn to and once again set out to cut off heraclius retreat
this time they met at the sarus river the two armies on opposite sides
however there was a bridge which spanned the river where the armies camped
upon seeing the sassanids heraclius sent half his army across the river to attack
but this time it was shahrbaraz who set the trap
he had kept the main force of his army back out of sight and feigned a retreat with those who were being chased
this time it was the byzantines who were ambushed and defeated quickly
even so the sassanids failed to guard the bridge and heraclius crossed it with the rest of his army
the sassanid army tried to cut them down with arrows but heraclius ignored them
shahrbaraz expressed his admiration in the face of his opponent 's fearless attack
he was quoted as telling a greek among his numbers see your emperor
he fears our arrows and spears no more than an anvil
though they lost the initial skirmish the byzantines won the battle and made it safely back to their own territory
byzantine sassanid war 602 628)now the war was entering its final phase
after having the byzantine empire on the ropes khosrau had seen how dangerous it could still be
so he decided to go for a knockout blow
he raised two more armies one under the command of shahin who had also survived heraclius campaign and the other under the now famous shahrbaraz
shahin 's army of about 50,000 was tasked with preventing another byzantine invasion
shahrbaraz 's army which was smaller was sent into byzantine territory and ordered to march on the capital
in 626 it reached chalcedon the settlement across the bosphorus from constantinople and camped there
khosrau tried to insure victory by forming an alliance with the slavs and avars who broke their treaty with the byzantines and invaded from the north
despite all these measures constantinople remained a virtually impregnable city at least until the invention of gunpowder
the slavs and avars assaulted the walls but had little impact
the sassanid army tried to cross the bosphorus under cover of darkness but the byzantine navy scouted them out and sank their rafts killing many of them
after two days of attack and no support from the persians the slavs and avars gave up and retreated back to their own territory
now it was heraclius turn
he had an alliance of his own up his sleeve
the sassanids had an enemy on their northern border as well
the byzantines called them the khazars they are more commonly known as the turks
heraclius made a treaty with them and 40,000 turks invaded the sassanid empire shortly after the siege on constantinople
heraclius then invaded too with his army and met up with the turks at tiflis modern tbilisi
khosrau sent reinforcements to the city but it fell nevertheless after a year long siege
almost immediately after heraclius turned south and once again moved deep into sassanid territory
and once again he proved to be a master of unconventional warfare
refusing to break for winter as was customary he intended to strike at the heart of the empire at the end of 627
now it was khosrau who was in a desperate situation
what little army he had left met heraclius at the ancient ruins of nineveh
after a long eight hour battle the sassanid army was finally beaten in a close fight
khosrau fled ctesiphon fearing for his life
but heraclius was in no position to attack the fortified capital of the sassanid empire
he did however loot the city of dastagird to recover as much wealth for his drained treasury as possible
knowing that a complete victory was not possible heraclius once again extended an offer of peace to khosrau
little did he know however that khosrau ii was overthrown by his personal guard and his own son kavadh ii installed as the new emperor
heraclius returned to constantinople in triumph but there were no real winners as we shall soon see
