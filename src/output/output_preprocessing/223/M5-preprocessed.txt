the fall of the roman empire constantine the great 306 337 c.e. divided the roman empire in two and made christianity the dominant religion in the region
the invading army reached the outskirts of rome which had been left totally undefended
in 410 c.e. the visigoths led by alaric breached the walls of rome and sacked the capital of the roman empire
the visigoths looted burned and pillaged their way through the city leaving a wake of destruction wherever they went
the plundering continued for three days
for the first time in nearly a millennium the city of rome was in the hands of someone other than the romans
this was the first time that the city of rome was sacked but by no means the last
constantine and the rise of christianity one of the many factors that contributed to the fall of the roman empire was the rise of a new religion christianity
the christian religion which was monotheistic ran counter to the traditional roman religion which was polytheistic many gods
at different times the romans persecuted the christians because of their beliefs which were popular among the poor
this 16th century medallion depicts attila the hun one of the most vicious invaders of all time
in 313 c.e. roman emperor constantine the great ended all persecution and declared toleration for christianity
later that century christianity became the official state religion of the empire
this drastic change in policy spread this relatively new religion to every corner of the empire
by approving christianity the roman state directly undermined its religious traditions
finally by this time romans considered their emperor a god
but the christian belief in one god who was not the emperor weakened the authority and credibility of the emperor
constantine enacted another change that helped accelerate the fall of the roman empire
in 330 c.e. he split the empire into two parts the western half centered in rome and the eastern half centered in constantinople a city he named after himself
why two empires this map of the roman empire in 476 c.e. shows the various people who invaded and how they carved up the empire
in 324 constantine 's army defeated the forces of licinius the emperor of the east
constantine became emperor of the entire empire and founded a new capital city in the eastern half at byzantium
the city was his new rome and was later named constantinople the city of constantine
empress theodora was one of the most powerful women of late antiquity
she helped keep her husband emperor justinian in power and solidified the strength of the byzantine empire in the 6th century c.e. as the western empire collapsed
constantinople was advantageously situated for two reasons
first it was on a peninsula that could be fortified and defended easily
further because constantinople was located on the frontiers of the empire imperial armies could respond more easily to external attacks or threats
some scholars also believe that constantine established a new city in order to provide a place for the young religion of christianity to grow in an environment purer than that of corrupt rome
the western empire spoke latin and was roman catholic
the eastern empire spoke greek and worshipped under the eastern orthodox branch of the christian church
over time the east thrived while the west declined
in fact after the western part of the roman empire fell the eastern half continued to exist as the byzantine empire for hundreds of years
therefore the fall of rome really refers only to the fall of the western half of the empire
other fundamental problems contributed to the fall
in the economically ailing west a decrease in agricultural production led to higher food prices
the western half of the empire had a large trade deficit with the eastern half
the west purchased luxury goods from the east but had nothing to offer in exchange
to make up for the lack of money the government began producing more coins with less silver content
this led to inflation
finally piracy and attacks from germanic tribes disrupted the flow of trade especially in the west
there were political and military difficulties as well
it did n't help matters that political amateurs were in control of rome in the years leading up to its fall
army generals dominated the emperorship and corruption was rampant
over time the military was transformed into a mercenary army with no real loyalty to rome
as money grew tight the government hired the cheaper and less reliable germanic soldiers to fight in roman armies
by the end these armies were defending rome against their fellow germanic tribesmen
under these circumstances the sack of rome came as no surprise
goth rockers wave after wave of germanic barbarian tribes swept through the roman empire
groups such as the visigoths vandals angles saxons franks ostrogoths and lombards took turns ravaging the empire eventually carving out areas in which to settle down
the angles and saxons populated the british isles and the franks ended up in france
in 476 c.e. romulus the last of the roman emperors in the west was overthrown by the germanic leader odoacer who became the first barbarian to rule in rome
the order that the roman empire had brought to western europe for 1000 years was no more
