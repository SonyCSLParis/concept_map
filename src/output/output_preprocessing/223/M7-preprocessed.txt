the fall of constantinople1453
the siege of constantinople the capital of the byzantine empire and one of the most heavily fortified cities in the world took place in 1453
sultan mehmed ii ruler of the ottoman turks led the assault
the city was defended by at most 10,000 men
the turks had between 100,000 and 150,000 men on their side
the siege lasted for fifty days
the turks employed various important war tactics in taking over the city
they used huge cannon to destroy the walls warships were used to the cut the city 's sea defense
they also used an extensive infantry to engulf the city
after using his heavy artillery to form a breach in the wall the fist attack was launched upon constantinople on a may morning at 1:00 a.m.
the shout of men could be heard miles away
this fist attack was led by the bashi bazouks
they tried to attack the weakest point in the walls
they knew they were outnumbered and out skilled but they still fought with passion
after fighting for two hours they were called to retreat
the second attack was brought on by the anatolian turks from ishak 's army
this army could easily be recognized by their specialized uniforms
this army was also more organized than the first
they used their cannons to blast through the walls of the city
by using trumpets and other noises they were able to break the concentration of their opponents
they were the first army to enter the city
the christians were ready for them as they entered
they were able to massacre much of the army from this attack
this attack was called off at dawn
before the army was able to gain strength and order another attack feel upon them
mehmet 's favorite set of troops called the janissaries started to attack
they launched arrows missiles bullets stones and javelins at the enemy
they maintained perfect unity in this attack unlike the other attempts
this battle at the stockade was a long tiring battle for the troops
the soldiers fought in hand to hand combat
someone had to give
it was the christians
the turks remembered a port called the kerkoporta
they noticed it had accidentally been left open by the christians
the christian army frequently used that gate to try to penetrate the flank of the turkish army
they stormed the gate but the christians were able to stop them before completely entering the city
while battles were being fought on land the turks were also trying to take control of the sea
many ships were placed in the golden horn and off of the marmora shore to help siege the city
many of the soldiers came from these ships to aid the army on land
once the signal was sent troops flooded off of these ships to take down the harbor walls and start looting the city
the city was now completely taken over by the turks
mehmed renamed the city istanbul
to further glorify the city he built mosques palaces monuments and a system of aqueducts
the city was now officially claimed for islam
new rules and regulations came about for the conquered
the greeks were to form communities within the empire called milets
the christians were still allowed to practice their religion but had to dress in distinguishing attire and could not bear arms
so came the end to the great city of constantinople
