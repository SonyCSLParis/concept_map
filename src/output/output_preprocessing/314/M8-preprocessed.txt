the csi effect forensic scienceposted by the exchange on 06/30/2011can watching forensic focused tv shows like csi affect how you act as a juror
that is the question behind several studies on the so called csi effect jurors who watch csi or other crime dramas are influenced by the shows exaggerated portrayal of forensic science and measure their experience and decisions as a juror against fictional hollywood standards
according to the csi effect theory jurors now demand scientific evidence in criminal trials and without such evidence are less likely to convict
the csi effect myth
but is it true
do popular televisions dramas like csi and bones warp ideas of forensic science
according to donald e. shelton the chief judge of washtenaw county michigan the short answer is no
in 2010 shelton published a study that interviewed more than 2,000 jurors regarding their television watching habits and expectations of scientific evidence in criminal trials
while the study did find a high expectation of scientific evidence 52 of jurors expected some kind of scientific evidence in every criminal case the study did not find a link between watching csi type programs and being less likely to convict without scientific evidence
like the unicorn and the mermaid the study reports the csi effect is a myth
so it looks like csi and other crime dramas are in the clear
but without a television scapegoat what is to blame for high expectations of scientific evidence in criminal trials blaming csi or any television show is just too simplistic
it ’s much bigger than that shelton said
the high expectations the study explains can be attributed to broader changes in our culture as a whole
for example the availability and rapid advancement of technology creates a perception that forensic science technology is widely available to police departments as well as highly accurate and advanced a perception that simply is not true
in science we trust what might startle jurors is the lack of science in forensic science
a 2009 report by the national academy of sciences nas concluded that the level of scientific development and evaluation varies substantially among forensic science disciplines dna analysis for example is highly accurate
it also has a clear method for analysis and declaring a dna match which is backed by years of scientific research
by comparison microscopic hair analysis without dna is highly unreliable with little scientific backing and no standards for declaring a match
because hair analysis without dna is performed by comparing hair strands under a microscope the categorization of hair features and declaration of a match is also dependent on the opinion of the examiner
even fingerprint analysis expected in every criminal case by 47.3 of the jurors in shelton ’s study is not reliable
fingerprints are analyzed by a method of visual examination and comparison known as the ace v technique which a 2006 study concluded did not have any scientific validity
fingerprint analysis is also subjective and biased
fingerprint examiners in the fbi investigation of the 2004 madrid train bombing erroneously indentified brandon mayfield as a suspect
it was later revealed that the examiners were influenced by the urgency of the investigation
other forensic science disciplines such as shoeprint identification fiber analysis bite mark analysis and bloodstain pattern analysis are judgment based methods with little scientific backing
yet jurors expect and trust the science behind these analyses
csi
informing the public on television shows like csi and law order forensic science is high tech sophisticated and accurate which is exactly how it should be portrayed for an hour long drama
how else can characters catch the bad guy would you rather watch an hour of dna analysis or fingerprint comparison
we did n’t think so what is interesting is how the fictional world of crime drama with all its sleek technology and instant test results is encouraging viewers to learn more about forensic science in some cases inspiring students to major in forensic science or other sciences
besides influencing viewers to pursue studies in forensic science the television show has sparked a science exhibit called csi the experience
so the show blamed for misinforming jurors is informing the public on the realities of forensic science
this is not to suggest all crime dramas need to follow the same high tech high flash presentation of forensic science
it is good to have realistic representations of the limitations of forensic science and sometimes crime dramas do let characters wrestle with the limits
forensic evidence is sometimes thrown out in television court drama fictional investigators sometimes have to admit they made the wrong call small steps but still appreciated
and sometimes admittedly it is more interesting to watch what can go wrong than what can go right in forensic science
either way people are watching and learning which we call the csi inspiration
