the csi effect does it really exist by honorable donald e. shelton crime and courtroom proceedings have long been fodder for film and television scriptwriters
in recent years however the media 's use of the courtroom as a vehicle for drama has not only proliferated it has changed focus
in apparent fascination with our criminal justice process many of today 's courtroom dramas are based on actual cases
court tv offers live gavel to gavel coverage of trials over the internet for $ 5.95 a month
now that 's reality television
reality and fiction have begun to blur with crime magazine television shows such as 48 hours mystery american justice and even on occasion dateline nbc
these programs portray actual cases but only after extensively editing the content and incorporating narration for dramatic effect
presenting one 35 year old cold case for example 48 hours mystery filmed for months to capture all pretrial hearings as well as the 2 week trial the program however was ultimately edited to a 1 hour episode that suggested the crime remained a mystery
notwithstanding the jury 's guilty verdict
the next level of distortion of the criminal justice system is the extremely popular reality based crime fiction television drama
the law order franchise for example appears on television several nights a week promoting plots ripped from the headlines
 it and other television programs pluck an issue suggested by an actual case and weave a story around it
the most popular courtroom dramas whether actual edited or purely fictional focus on the use of new science and technology in solving crimes
csi
crime scene investigation has been called the most popular television show in the world
not only is csi so popular that it has spawned other versions that dominate the traditional television ratings it has also prompted similar forensic dramas such as cold case bones and numb3rs
according to one 2006 weekly nielsen rating:30 million people watched csi on one night 70 million watched at least one of the three csi shows 40 million watched two other forensic dramas without a trace and cold case
those ratings translated into this fact five of the top 10 television programs that week were about scientific evidence in criminal cases
together they amassed more than 100 million viewers
how many of those viewers reported for jury duty the next day
claims and commonly held beliefs many attorneys judges and journalists have claimed that watching television programs like csi has caused jurors to wrongfully acquit guilty defendants when no scientific evidence has been presented
the mass media quickly picked up on these complaints
this so called effect was promptly dubbed the csi effect laying much of the blame on the popular television series and its progeny
i once heard a juror complain that the prosecution had not done a thorough job because they did n't even dust the lawn for fingerprints as one district attorney put it jurors now expect us to have a dna test for just about every case
they expect us to have the most advanced technology possible and they expect it to look like it does on television
 but is this really the expectation of today 's jurors and if so is it the fault of csi and its ilk
to date the limited evidence that we have had on this issue has been largely anecdotal based primarily on prosecutor interviews with jurors after trials
now however we have some findings based on a formal study that two researchers and i recently performed
gregg barak ph.d. and young kim ph.d. criminology professors at eastern michigan university and i surveyed 1,000 jurors prior to their participation in trial processes
the prospective jurors were questioned regarding their expectations and demands for scientific evidence and their television watching habits including csi and similar programs
our goal was to determine if there was any empirical evidence behind the commonly held beliefs that juror expectations for forensic evidence and their demand for it as a condition for conviction are linked to watching law related television shows
what programs do jurors watch
in june july and august 2006 a written questionnaire was completed by 1,027 randomly summoned jurors in ann arbor michigan
the potential jurors who completed the survey prior to any jury selection were assured that their responses were anonymous and unrelated to their possible selection as a juror
first we obtained demographic information and asked the prospective jurors about their television viewing habits including the programs they watched how often and how real they thought the programs were
then we tried to determine what these potential jurors expected to see in terms of evidence from the prosecutor
the survey asked questions about seven types of cases every criminal case
murder or attempted murder
physical assault of any kind
rape or other criminal sexual conduct
breaking and entering
any theft case
any crime involving a gun
with respect to each of these categories of crimes we then asked what types of evidence the prospective jurors expected to see eyewitness testimony from the alleged victim
eyewitness testimony from at least one other witness
circumstantial evidence
scientific evidence of some kind
dna evidence
fingerprint evidence
ballistics or other firearms laboratory evidence
then we got to the heart of the matter not only did we want to explore jury expectations regarding scientific evidence we also wanted to discover whether the prospective jurors would demand to see scientific evidence before they would find a defendant guilty
we asked the survey participants how likely they would be to find a defendant guilty or not guilty based on certain types of evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense
using the same cases and evidence described above we gave potential jurors 13 scenarios and five choices for each i would find the defendant guilty
i would probably find the defendant guilty
i am not sure what i would do
i would probably find the defendant not guilty
i would find the defendant not guilty to help ensure that all of the survey respondents were operating from the same legal guidelines we gave them the burden of proof and reasonable doubt instructions that are given to all seated jurors in criminal cases in michigan
juror expectations for forensic evidence did the survey respondents expect the prosecution to present some kind of scientific evidence our survey indicated that:46 percent expected to see some kind of scientific evidence in every criminal case 22 percent expected to see dna evidence in every criminal case 36 percent expected to see fingerprint evidence in every criminal case 32 percent expected to see ballistic or other firearms laboratory evidence in every criminal case
the findings also suggested that the jurors expectations were not just blanket expectations for scientific evidence
rather expectations for particular types of scientific evidence seemed to be rational based on the type of case
for example a higher percentage of respondents expected to see dna evidence in the more serious violent offenses such as murder or attempted murder 46 percent and rape 73 percent than in other types of crimes
our findings also indicated that a higher percentage wanted to see fingerprint evidence in breaking and entering cases 71 percent any theft case 59 percent and in crimes involving a gun 66 percent
the envelope please
.it was not a surprise that law order and csi were the two most frequently watched law related television programs 45 percent and 42 percent respectively of the surveyed jurors
we found that frequent csi viewers also frequently watched other law related programs and those who did not watch csi tended not to watch such programs
we also found that csi viewers in general were more likely to be female and politically moderate
respondents with less education tended to watch csi more frequently than those who had more education
as to how real a television program was perceived to be our results indicated that the more frequently jurors watched a given program the more accurate they perceived the program to be
what role then did watching csi play in the respondents expectations and demands for forensic evidence
forensic evidence and jury verdicts for all categories of evidence both scientific and nonscientific csi viewers those who watch csi on occasion often or regularly generally had higher expectations than non csi viewers those who never or almost never watch the program
but it is possible that the csi viewers may have been better informed jurors than the non csi viewers
the csi viewers had higher expectations about scientific evidence that was more likely to be relevant to a particular crime than did the non csi viewers
the csi viewers also had lower expectations about evidence that was less likely to be relevant to a particular crime than did the non csi viewers
although our study revealed that the prospective jurors had high expectations for scientific evidence the more important question i believe is whether those expectations were more likely to result in an acquittal if they were not met
in other words do jurors demand to see scientific evidence before they will find a defendant guilty
interestingly in most of the scenarios presented potential jurors increased expectations of scientific evidence did not translate into a demand for this type of evidence as a prerequisite for finding someone guilty
based on our findings jurors were more likely to find a defendant guilty than not guilty even without scientific evidence if the victim or other witnesses testified except in the case of rape
1 on the other hand if the prosecutor relied on circumstantial evidence the prospective jurors said they would demand some kind of scientific evidence before they would return a guilty verdict
it 's not csi
there was scant evidence in our survey results that csi viewers were either more or less likely to acquit defendants without scientific evidence
only 4 of 13 scenarios showed somewhat significant differences between viewers and non viewers on this issue and they were inconsistent
here are some of our findings in the every crime scenario csi viewers were more likely to convict without scientific evidence if eyewitness testimony was available
in rape cases csi viewers were less likely to convict if dna evidence was not presented
in both the breaking and entering and theft scenarios csi viewers were more likely to convict if there was victim or other testimony but no fingerprint evidence
hypothesis and discussion on what it means although csi viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence than non csi viewers these expectations had little if any bearing on the respondents propensity to convict
this we believe is an important finding and seemingly very good news for our nation 's criminal justice system that is differences in expectations about evidence did not translate into important differences in the willingness to convict
that said we believe it is crucial for judges and lawyers to understand juror expectations for forensic evidence
even though our study did not reveal a so called csi effect at play in courtrooms my fellow researchers and i believe that a broader tech effect exists that influences juror expectations and demands
during the past 30 years scientific advances and discoveries have led to a technology revolution
the development and miniaturization of computers and the application of computer technology to almost every human endeavor have been primary forces in new scientific discoveries
at the same time new technology has created a revolution in information availability and transmission
the internet is an obvious example and in many ways it has been the catalyst for this ongoing revolution
science and information feed off each other advancements in science are fostered by the ability of scientists to exchange and transfer information
at the same time scientific developments almost immediately become available not only to scientists but also to the entire world
it is hardly unexpected that the media grab scientific discoveries and quickly make them part of our popular culture
many laypeople know or think they know more about science and technology from what they have learned through the media than from what they learned in school
it is those people who sit on juries
every week the ever evolving scientific and information age comes marching through the courtroom door in the psyche of almost every juror who takes a seat in the box
the jury is always right'our legal system demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt before the government is allowed to punish an alleged criminal
when a scientific test is available that would produce evidence of guilt or innocence but the prosecution chooses not to perform that test and present its results to the jury it may be reasonable for a jury to doubt the strength of the government 's case
this reality may seem unreasonable to some but that is not the issue
rather it is how the criminal justice system will respond to juror expectations
one response to this change in expectations would be to get the evidence that jurors seek
this would take a major commitment to increasing law enforcement resources and would require equipping police and other investigating agencies with the most up to date forensic science equipment
in addition significant improvements would need to be made in the capacity of our nation 's crime laboratories to reduce evidence backlogs and keep pace with increased demands for forensic analyses
2]another response would be to equip officers of the court i.e. judges prosecutors and defense lawyers with more effective ways to address juror expectations
when scientific evidence is not relevant prosecutors must find more convincing ways to explain the lack of relevance to jurors
most importantly prosecutors defense lawyers and judges should understand anticipate and address the fact that jurors enter the courtroom with a lot of information about the criminal justice system and the availability of scientific evidence
the bottom line is this our criminal justice system must find ways to adapt to the increased expectations of those whom we ask to cast votes of guilty or not guilty

he has written extensively on the impact of technology on the law and the right to a trial by jury
notes[1
only 14 percent of respondents said that they would find a defendant guilty in a rape case if the victim 's testimony was presented without any scientific evidence 26 percent answered that they would find the defendant not guilty without scientific evidence
