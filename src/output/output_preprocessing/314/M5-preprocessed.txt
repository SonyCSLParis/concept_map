transcript of sts228 csi effect section one viv the csi effect the csi effect in summary is the unrealistic public perception of the effectiveness and availability of forensic science in our criminal justice system which is nurtured by the sensationalised presentations of forensic science within crime scene television dramas
t.v. expectations = jurors now demand scientifically unattainable forensic proof as seen in csi programs
strong prosecutor 's effect csi has increased juror expectations for forensic evidence
weak prosecutor 's effect
 csi has altered prosecutorial behaviour including discussing csi in summations and requesting legally unnecessary forensic tests
defendant 's effect csi television programs through their positive portrayals of forensic scientists illustrate it to be infallible
producers effect csi television programs are educational
educator 's effect claims that csi is attracting young people into careers in forensic science
police chief 's effect
 this claim holds that csi has educated criminals on how to avoid detection
section 2 oliver3
the popularity of tv forensic science dramas have sometimes been accounted for in terms of satisfying viewers emotional demands for closure and justice and for forensic science to reveal truth ’s that are more elusive in the real world
do you agree or disagree with this view
what do you think 
are these tv shows giving the public an unrealistic expectation of what forensic science is capable of 1
do forensic science dramas enhance or diminish the public understanding of science and technology 2
is the csi effect real how much can the media really influence the way people think and behave colein tv shows the forensics portrayed are undoubtedly presented to be more entertaining than factual
but this does not mean that the public expects real forensic science to match what is seen on tv
there is a clear distinction between what is real forensic science and what is seen on tv
in a study cited in this weeks reading reality fantasy and truth about csi effects a juror was asked about whether or not sophisticated forensic techniques would affect his decision he replied no that ’s just csi stuff it looks nice
but it ’s just csi visuals
in these popular forensic tv shows closure and justice are served on a platter within the hour time slot
do you think that this has caused the public to develop expectations of closure and justice to be served within a short amount of time
in general people are able to distinguish between fact and fiction
just because they see resolutions quickly in tv shows does not necessarily mean they expect to see them that quickly in real life
i do agree with the above view as tv shows are made with entertainment as their primary goal not education
