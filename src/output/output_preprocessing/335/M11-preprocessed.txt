the pendle witches
by christine goodier maon august 20th
1612 ten people convicted of witchcraft at the summer assize held in lancaster castle went to the gallows on the moors above the town
among their number were two men and a woman in her eighties
their crimes included laming causing madness and what was termed simple witchcraft
in addition to this some sixteen unexplained deaths many stretching back decades were laid at their door
lancashire in the early years of the seventeenth century was remote its roads poor its people ill educated
throughout the county there were places where the outside world hardly intruded and one such area was pendle forest
it was here among stark hillsides infertile valleys and scattered hamlets that the story of the pendle witches had its beginnings
an ill fated meetingon march 18th
1612 a young woman by the name of alison device was out begging on the road to colne
she stopped a peddler from halifax john law and asked him for a pin
he refused her request and walked away
according to alison 's own testimony her familiar spirit in the shape of a dog appeared to her and asked if she would like him to harm law
alison was new to the art of witchcraft indeed she seems to have resisted being indoctrinated into what was in effect the family business
but now she agreed that law must be punished and she told the dog to lame the peddler
no doubt to her great surprise the curse took immediate effect and law fell to the ground paralysed down one side presumably by a stroke and unable to speak
he was taken to a local inn and later alison was brought to his bedside
she admitted her part in his illness and begged his forgiveness which he gave
however law 's son abraham had become involved and he was far from satisfied
he took the matter to roger nowell the local magistrate and from there things snowballed at an alarming rate
after hearing the most awful admissions from those he interviewed nowell made many arrests
by the end of april nineteen people including a group from samlesbury and isobel roby from windle were incarcerated in lancaster castle awaiting trial at the august assize
the pendle accused and their crimesthe most famous of the pendle witches actually died before coming to trial
elizabeth southernes old demdike had admitted to nowell that she was a witch
in so doing she also implicated many of her co accused as did anne whittle old chattox who was herself accused of the murder by witchcraft of robert nutter also implicated were members of both their families elizabeth device demdike 's daughter was accused of two murders as was her son james while alison was to stand trial for what she had done to john law on that fateful spring day five months before
anne redfearne chattox 's daughter stood accused of the murder of christopher nutter eighteen years previously
others were dragged into the affair john and jane bulcock a mother and her son were tried for causing madness and for being at a so called witches sabbath held at malkin tower on good friday 1612 alice nutter from roughlee hall was accused of killing one henry mitton because he refused to give demdike a penny margaret pearson was accused of bewitching one of her neighbour 's horses to death and katherine hewitt was accused of the murder of ann foulds
the trials day onelancaster formed part of the northern circuit and the assize court judges visited the town twice a year
the trials commenced on tuesday 18th august with sir edward bromley presiding
first into the dock was old chattox
she was accused of the murder of robert nutter some eighteen years previously
she pleaded not guilty but eventually confessed when confronted by evidence given by demdike and james device to roger nowell back in april
elizabeth device followed her into court
she stood charged with three counts of murder accusations she vehemently denied
however the prosecution had a star witness in the form of elizabeth 's own nine year old daughter jennet
her evidence was devastating and elizabeth was so overcome with anger that she had to be removed from court
jennet told of familiar spirits of the making of clay images in order to cause death of the sabbath supposedly held at malkin tower on good friday where it was decided to blow up the castle and kill the governor thomas covell in order to free those imprisoned there
she spoke of witches mounting ponies and flying off on them before vanishing into thin air
inevitably elizabeth was found guilty as well
james device was tried next
he was in a pitiable condition and may even have been physically ill treated during his imprisonment
however there was little sympathy for him and after more hearsay evidence and his own testimony he was found guilty along with elizabeth device and anne whittle
the samlesbury witchesalthough nothing to do with the pendle case this trial is extremely interesting because it hints at a hidden agenda behind all the trials
three women were accused of practising witchcraft on the person of grace sowerbutts a teenage girl who was related to the defendants
however the accused were able to convince the judge that they were victims of a catholic plot and were all acquitted
the trials
day twoanne redfearne had already been acquitted of one murder
now she was tried for killing christopher nutter eighteen years previously
the evidence hinged on nutter 's daughter remembering that her father believed he was the victim of a curse
she had also been seen making clay images by james device
anne was found guilty
next into the dock was alice nutter
she was a gentlewoman and the evidence against her was flimsy
however her fate was sealed by jennet device who identified her as being present at the infamous sabbath
alice too was convicted
the trial of katherine hewitt mouldheels went much the same way with little jennet again the star witness
katherine was convicted as well
jennet 's evidence against john and jane bulcock was even more slight she remembered john turning a spit on which they had roasted a lamb that good friday
it was illegal to aid or assist a witch and this was enough in 1612 along with other hearsay evidence to seal the fate of both defendants
margaret pearson was tried for killing a horse by riding it to death hag ridden from which we get the modern word haggard
she was convicted although ultimately not condemned
alizon device was the last of the pendle witches to be tried
unusually the key witness against her was also the victim john law
he was the object of much pity as his brush with alison had left him crippled
when he was assisted into court alison rushed to him and begged his forgiveness once more which he again gave
the court was moved to ask her if she could help restore him to health
she told them she was not powerful enough but that old demdike had she lived could have done so
alison was found guilty
isobel roby from windle also stood trial on charges of witchcraft at this assize and she too was convicted
all that remained was for the sentences to be handed down
bromley had little option under the terms of the 1604 witchcraft act all the accused had been found guilty of crimes punishable by death
on august 20th 1612 the ten condemned prisoners were taken to the moors above the town and hanged
a wonderfull discoveriethe trials in lancaster in august 1612 are among the most famous witchcraft trials in history
this is mainly due to the fact that we have a very full albeit biased account of them left to us by the clerk of the court thomas potts
in 1613 he published his account of these events in a book entitled the wonderfull discoverie of witches in the countie of lancaster
 this is our only real primary source for what was going on in the more remote areas of lancashire over all those years and potts was writing for an audience which included king james i himself and one which was more than ready to believe in the existence of such evil
this was also a time of great tension and of anti catholic rhetoric
the gunpowder plot was still fresh in the memory and potts chose to dedicate his book to lord knyvett the man who had actually arrested guy fawkes in 1605
politics and religion played their part in the prosecutions and convictions in lancaster in 1612 but the inescapable fact remains that at the end of the day ten people lost their lives found guilty of a crime that no longer even officially exists
