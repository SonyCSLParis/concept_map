the pendle witch documentary world documentary channel the trials of the pendle witches in 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in english history and some of the best recorded of the 17th century
the twelve accused lived in the area around pendle hill in lancashire and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft
all but two were tried at lancaster assizes on 18â€“19 august 1612 along with the samlesbury witches and others in a series of trials that have become known as the lancashire witch trials
one was tried at york assizes on 27 july 1612 and another died in prison
of the eleven who went to trial nine women and two men ten were found guilty and executed by hanging one was found not guilty
the official publication of the proceedings by the clerk to the court thomas potts in his the wonderfull discoverie of witches in the countie of lancaster and the number of witches hanged together nine at lancaster and one at york make the trials unusual for england at that time
it has been estimated that all the english witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total
six of the pendle witches came from one of two families each at the time headed by a woman in her eighties
elizabeth southerns aka demdike[a her daughter elizabeth device and her grandchildren james and alizon device anne whittle aka chattox and her daughter anne redferne
the others accused were jane bulcock and her son john bulcock alice nutter katherine hewitt alice gray and jennet preston
the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches
many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the demdike and chattox families made against each other perhaps because they were in competition both trying to make a living from healing begging and extortion
