the witch trials pendle witch trials england 1612 1634
the pendle witch trials part of the more extensive lancashire witch trials are among the most famous witch trials in english history as well as some of the best recorded of the 17th century
unusually for england at that time the trial proceedings were officially published by the clerk to the court thomas potts in his â€œthe wonderfull discoverie of witches in the countie of lancasterâ€. the original twelve accused all lived in the area around pendle hill in lancashire england a wild and lawless region at that time
roger nowell the local justice of the peace was required in 1612 to compile a list of recusants in the area those who refused to attend the english church and to take communion which was then a criminal offence and at the same time a claim was brought by a halifax peddler named john law against alizon device of pendle accusing her of causing a stroke by witchcraft
she freely confessed that she had sold her soul to the devil and appeared to be convinced of her own powers to injure
during questioning however more members of the family became implicated as well as members of another family the chattoxes who were also reputedly involved in witchcraft in the pendle area and who were rivals and competitors of the device family as well as several others who were merely acquaintances of the families
in the end twelve people from pendle were accused alizon device elizabeth device james device elizabeth southerns alice gray jennet preston anne whittle anne redferne alice nutter katherine hewitt john bulcock and jane bulcock
some of them appear to have genuinely believed in their own guilt and probably did indeed consider themselves to be witches in the sense of being village healers who practised magic probably in return for payment such men and women were common in 16th and 17th century rural england and an accepted part of village life
the twelve were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft and ten of the twelve were tried at lancaster assizes in august 1612 in a group that also included the salmesbury witches jane southworth jennet brierley and ellen brierley who were charged with child murder and cannibalism margaret pearson the so called padiham witch who was facing her third trial for witchcraft this time for killing a horse and isobel robey from windle accused of using witchcraft to cause sickness
the trials have become known collectively as the lancashire witch trials
one jennet preston was tried at york and one elizabeth southerns died in prison
of the eleven individuals who went to trial nine women and two men ten were found guilty and executed by hanging and only one alice gray was found not guilty
nine year old jennet device was a key witness for the prosecution giving evidence against members of her own family something that would not have been permitted in many other 17th century criminal trials but king james had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his â€œdaemonologieâ€. several years later having played her part in the deaths of her mother brother and sister jennet device found herself accused of witchcraft as well
she was one of a group of twenty tried at lancaster assizes in 1633 1634 all but one of whom were found guilty
one of the most notable of the accused was margaret johnson who having convinced herself of her own guilt handed herself in to the authorities
her subsequent declaration contains all the classic ingredients of a witchcraft confession including her description of selling her soul to a demon called mamilian
however the witches of 1633 1634 although found guilty in lancashire were able to appeal to the crown and four women including margaret johnson were sent to london for further investigation
after being examined by doctors it was concluded that they were innocent in spite of johnsonâ€ ™ s voluntary confession
they were not therefore executed and remained incarcerated in lancaster gaol where it is likely they died
these later lancashire witchcraft trials were the subject of the contemporary play by thomas heywood and richard brome â€œthe late lancashire witchesâ€. pendle hill which dominates the landscape of the area continues to be associated with witchcraft and hosts a hilltop gathering every halloween
the witches have become the inspiration for much of pendle 's tourism and heritage industries
