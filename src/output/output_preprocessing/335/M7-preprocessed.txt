joe hesketh a pendle witch trial investigation artist joe hesketh seeks to understand the horrors of the pendle witch trial through art being a child in pendle was like living on what would now be familiar as a harry potter film set
some of the older children thought i was a bit odd so i took advantage of this and played on being different and standing out
i played at making up my own spells creating perfume from petals and things like that
these games made me happy and i thought they gave me the upper hand and made me special â€ just like the witches i guess
over the years people have bought me spell books and i still do well wishes today
iâ€ ™ ve always been intrigued with the pendle story and wanted to look at it closer and through doing this a pendle investigation developed
i wanted to connect with the story in celebration of the 400th anniversary by investigating the known facts to build a body of work
my work is mainly about my life and for me pendle was the natural step and progression in my artistic journey
lots of things have changed in 400 years but you know lots have not
the pendle witch trials are revered in popular culture but usually misunderstood in the context of their time
i really want people to see the true story of injustice and the real story about people of the land who were basically healers rather than evil magicians
in 1612 these people were dreadfully misjudged and even today some are still quick to judge a book by its cover
i get this all the time people judge me instantly
and it seemed to be the same with the witches that people judged them for being different
iâ€ ™ m not saying that people donâ€ ™ t accept me but that people like to put other people in boxes
i think this shows the shallow nature of our society
people are not always what they seem to others
the twelve accused of witchcraft lived around pendle hill and were charged with the murders of ten people
of the eleven who went to trial â€ nine women and two men â€ ten were found guilty and hanged
it has been estimated that all of the english witch trials that took place between the 15th and 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions the pendle witch trials account for more than two per cent of that total
if the witches who were tried were guilty of anything it was of being simple folk who were simply trying to survive
most were very poor single women with no men to support them
if anything they were of guilty of just being different having different beliefs and an understanding of the earth and herbal medicines
i wanted to really feel and understand the story not just read the books which i had already done
so i thought why not walk the path and follow in their footsteps
as a result in 2011 i spent four days walking the long purgatory trail that links pendle forest and lancaster castle the two main sites of the infamous trials
i donâ€ ™ t think i was fully prepared for the way it affected me
i was on my own for long periods of time and it was a very powerful experience
one day it felt as if they were following me it was eerie i looked back at one point and for a split second i saw four women sat down wearing dark clothes
the next second there were only bushes
iâ€ ™ d been thinking about the witches a lot itâ€ ™ s hard to understand that this is the actual road they were taken on
obviously things have changed â€ the tarmac for one â€ but when you look around and see the ancient twisted trees and the bubbles of the trickling river you can imagine yourself right there
also the weather was atrocious when i walked â€ iâ€ ™ d wanted it to be grim but not this grim
i was soaked through and miserable but that was nothing in comparison to the sufferings of those women
after all i wasnâ€ ™ t hung at the end
although it happened so long ago these events mark the society we live in today ranging from bus routes named the witchway the dã © cor of the local pubs and local ales named after themed links
some people still donâ€ ™ t want to talk about the trials and some church schools still wonâ€ ™ t cover the story as history
pendle is an area where many new cultures have settled yet they are still treated differently because of their beliefs â€ being different isnâ€ ™ t always welcomed and probably never will be
people up to now have been really moved with the work more so if they know the story but i hope a connection is made with the images even if they donâ€ ™ t. from my experience most people in london
havenâ€ ™ t even heard of the pendle witches so i think itâ€ ™ s great education and helps to put the area on the map
i aim to bring a contemporary outlook to the violent story resonating with my own experiences as a woman of pendle
