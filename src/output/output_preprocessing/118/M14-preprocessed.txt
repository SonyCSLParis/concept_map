then both brough castle and appleby castle were taken by the scots and held until 1157 when they were retaken by the english
sometime during 1173/4 the castle was besieged by the scottish king william the lion
after valiant efforts by the six knights and their followers the castle was surrendered
then much of it was destroyed by the scottish army except for the outer walls and the base of the keep
