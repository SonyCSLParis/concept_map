list entry description summary of monument the upstanding and buried remains of brougham roman fort brocavum and its associated civil settlement and brougham medieval castle
reasons for designation brougham roman fort brocavum and civil settlement and brougham castle is scheduled for the following principal reasons
survival the monument survives well with the castle displaying significant upstanding fabric that illustrates its constructional development during the five centuries of its occupation while the roman fort survives well as a substantial earthwork partly overlain by the castle and partly surrounded by defensive ditches potential various limited archaeological excavations within the vicus castle and castle 's bailey have revealed the well preserved remains of buried archaeological features and the monument retains enormous potential for the preservation of similar archaeological material historic interest the monument retains significant historic interest to enhance our understanding of the roman and medieval military occupation and settlement of northern england and the responses to perceived and actual threats from the north during these periods documentation the roman fort and castle are well documented both historically and in the archaeological records which adds to their interest group value the castle has group value with strategically contemporary castles along the stainmore pass route over the pennines at bowes appleby and brough while the roman fort has group value with strategically contemporary forts at brough kirkby thore to the east low borrowbridge to the south old penrith and carlisle to the north and ambleside to the south west
historybrougham roman fort brocavum was constructed on the south bank of the river eamont near its confluence with the river lowther at the junction of main north south and east west roman roads which intersected and crossed the river eamont at this point
the occupation of the fort seems to have lasted from the governorship of agricola ad 78 84 to the end of the c4
it measured about 3.4 acres 1.37 ha
a small number of altars found locally are dedicated to belatucadrus a local deity who seems to have been a native equivalent of the roman god mars
an inscription records the presence of a part mounted cohort the cohors iii bracaraugustanorum a unit originally raised in portugal in the first century ad while an altar dedicated to mars by a soldier of the stratonician cavalry indicates that this unit originally raised in asia minor was stationed at brougham fort in the third century ad
during the c3 a substantial vicus or civilian settlement developed around the fort
the history of westmorland between the departure of the romans in the early c5 and the arrival of the normans in the latter half of the c11 is obscure
the collapse of northumbrian rule in the second half of the c9 left a vacuum which in the early c10 was filled by the kings of scots and their satellites the kings of british strathclyde
it is not known if brougham was an inhabited settlement at this time but the area remained within the scottish kingdom until the seizure of cumbria by william rufus 1056 1100 in 1092 when a new anglo scottish border was secured by a castle at carlisle
border warfare continued during the c12 and in 1203 king john 1167 1216 granted the lordship of westmorland to robert de vieuxpont died 1228 and early in his lordship documentary evidence suggests a well established community existed at brougham by this time
faced with the continued threat of rebellion and potential civil war vieuxpont acquired land for a castle at brougham in about 1214 and construction work in stone commenced shortly after
brougham was the last of three great norman castles bowes and brough being the others constructed along the strategic route through the pennines known as the stainmore pass
a three storey keep with a large forebuilding to the east giving access to the first floor of the keep was built together with a structure possibly a hall to the east and the castle was enclosed within a defensive earthwork topped by a timber palisade
the castle was probably entered from the roman fort to the south which may have provided a ready made outer bailey
by virtue of marriage robert clifford 1274 1314 succeeded to vieuxpont ’s westmorland heritage in the last decade of the c13
as an ally of edward i 1239 1307
clifford became involved in scottish affairs and made brougham his principal seat due to its proximity to the border
clifford made the keep the core of his castle by adding a storey and building a stone curtain wall and inner and outer gatehouses
these gatehouses provided the main access from the east and superseded the earlier entrance from the roman fort to the south
after robert clifford ’s death at bannockburn the scots were in the ascendance in northern england for several decades
it fell to robert ’s grandson roger clifford 1333 89 to restore brougham castle back to an effective border defence
as warden of the marches roger embarked on a building programme that saw the addition of ranges of buildings along the east and south curtains that included a great hall kitchen and chapel
he also constructed a covered way from the hall porch to the ground floor of the keep
after roger ’s death peace gradually came to the border region and despite brougham castle being kept in commission little additional building work was undertaken until the arrival of lady anne clifford 1590 1676 after the civil war 1642 51
as a young adult lady anne was involved in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the family estate and only took possession in 1649
the clifford ’s northern england estate included castles at pendragon mallerstang brough skipton appleby and brougham
she rotated her residences among her castles living in various ones for several months up to a year at a time
at brougham she rebuilt a service wing against the west curtain and inserted a number of fireplaces and doorways in the tudor style
she used the great hall as a courthouse and converted the top floor of the inner gatehouse to her bedchamber
this room connected by a passageway with the painted chamber in the outer gatehouse which had the dual use as a dining room or a withdrawing room from the great chamber in the adjacent building
as part of lady anne ’s transformation of the castle from a military complex to a country seat she built a new wall round the little park adjoining the castle and created a garden to the south and east of the castle
after lady anne ’s death brougham castle came to the earls of thanet and the castle gradually fell into irreparable ruin with usable material being sold off in 1714
the ruins of the castle have been consolidated and the moat was cleaned out during the 1930s
history of archaeological investigationno archaeological excavations are known to have taken place on the site of the roman fort
the antiquarians john leland and william stukeley visited brougham in the early c16 and in 1725 respectively
leland noted the finds of numerous square stones tokens of old buildings in the plough soil somewhere near the castle while stukeley described the fort as a square plot with a broad ditch around it with the track of a roman wall visible on the edge of the vallum
excavations within the south east corner of the castle ’s bailey in 1987 located what was considered to be a small part of the possible northern outer ditch of the roman fort complete with post holes suggesting that sharpened stakes or a thorn hedge had been utilised as a further defensive measure
the excavation also revealed that a large free standing medieval stone structure was constructed here some time after about 1300
in 1991 the rchme undertook a measured 1:500 survey of the castle and fort
in 1997 two trenches were excavated during conversion of the former custodian ’s cottage to an on site museum
trench 1 revealed post holes of an undated timber structure beneath a layer containing medieval pottery the latest being c14/15 date and a gold coin of edward iii ’s fourth coinage dated 1363 69
two unstratified roman coins dated 323 24 and 337 41 were also found
trench 2 revealed evidence of a stone building of unproven age possibly fronting the south side of the cobbled road to the castle
unstratified pottery from the roman period to the c19 was also found
in 2007 excavations were undertaken on the course of a services pipeline running through three fields to the south and south east of the fort
here highly significant c3 and c4 archaeological remains relating to the romano british civilian settlement associated with the fort were located
whilst the remains within the narrow confines of the course of the pipeline were fully excavated it was apparent the further remains would exist to either side of the pipeline
in 2010 investigations were undertaken prior to the insertion of new interpretation panels within the castle
no structural features were found
detailsthe monument includes the earthwork and buried remains of brougham roman fort the buried remains of the fort 's associated vicus or civil settlement lying to the south and south east of the fort and the upstanding and buried remains of brougham castle
the fort and castle are located on the south bank of the river eamont just below its confluence with the river lowther
the monument is divided into three separate areas one contains the fort and castle another contains the buried remains of the vicus in the field to the south of the fort and the third contains the buried remains of the vicus in two fields to the south east of the fort
further buried remains of the vicus lie to the north of the river and a66 beneath frenchfield sports centre and are scheduled separately cu279 national heritage list entry 1007180
a roman marching camp is located north of the a66 about 500 m north east of the fort and is scheduled separately cu242 nhle 1007187
an extensive roman settlement and cemetery is located north of the a66 about 550 m ene of the fort and is scheduled separately cu154 nhle 1007203
the northern defences of the roman fort have been obscured by medieval alterations caused by construction of the castle and its defences but the rchme 's 1991 survey indicates that the fort measured about 125 m north south by 110 m east west enclosing an area of 1.37 ha 3.4 acres
the fort 's defences consist of a turf covered bank up to 0.9 m high outside of which is a levelled berm and an outer ditch 10 14 m wide and up to 1.4 m deep
the defences are obscured towards the northern end of the fort by a later rectangular enclosure between the fort and castle
only the site of the fort 's west gate can be identified with certainty
internally the surface of the fort has been disturbed by later ridge and furrow ploughing drainage works and probable stone robbing
in the southern half of the fort there appear to be the disturbed remains of a two celled structure
archaeological excavation in 2007 revealed well preserved buried remains of the vicus in the field on the opposite side of the b6262 road to the south of the fort
these remains flank a roman road issuing from the fort 's south gate and include c3 and c4 rectilinear timber framed buildings minor roads lanes cobbled surfaces and a broadly contemporary field system represented by a system of ditches
in the field to the east of moor lane and south of the b6262 further building remains trackways ditched field boundaries and several large wells or waterholes were revealed while further east in the field south of the a66 trackways field boundaries wells or waterholes were also located together with several certain or probable cremation burials
these burials almost certainly formed part of the same burial ground that was largely destroyed during widening of the a66 in the later half of the c20
brougham castle is of stone construction and together with its southern defences it overlies the very northern part of the roman fort
it has been constructed on the spur of a low river cliff jutting into the floodplain which provides a natural defence on the north side and on the northern part of the west side
access is via a cobbled causeway leading from moor lane and passes through the outer gatehouse gatehouse court and inner gatehouse to emerge into a cobbled courtyard
a five storey keep is attached to the south side of the gatehouses and between the keep and the east curtain wall there are the remains of buildings including early and later halls a halls court and a forebuilding
a kitchen oven is located at the south east corner of the castle courtyard
along the south curtain wall are the remains of the kitchen court chapel and lodgings
to the west is a well and at the castle 's south west corner there is a four storey tower known as the tower of league
adjacent to the west curtain wall are the remains of an oven
other service buildings were located along the west curtain but all have been removed to ground level
the castle is surrounded by a moat on three sides that measures 15 18 m wide and up to 4 m deep
on the west side there is an outer ditch with a counterscarp bank
an earthen causeway crosses the ditch towards its south end
the inner moat is crossed in two places by stone revetted causeways one adjacent to the tower of league the other crossing the moat 's southern arm adjacent to a postern and giving access into a rectangular enclosure between the fort and castle mentioned above
this enclosure was a garden created or re established by lady anne clifford on the northern part of the roman fort
it was bounded on the west side by a low stone wall partially visible in the southern arm of the moat
to the south of the moat the wall is partly buried beneath a low turf covered bank
at its south west corner there are traces of a former structure identified by the rchme 's survey as a summer house
the garden enclosure was between 40 45 m wide and although there is now no trace of its eastern end it may have extended all the way to moor lane
extent of schedulingthis includes the upstanding and buried remains of brougham roman fort and two separate parts of its associated vicus together with the upstanding and buried remains of brougham castle
the monument falls into into three separately scheduled areas of protection one contains the fort and castle another contains the buried remains of the vicus in the field to the south of the fort and the third contains the buried remains of the vicus in two fields to the south east of the fort
the boundary of that part of the monument that includes the roman fort and the castle runs along the field boundaries which flank the b6262 to the south and moor lane to the east
it then follows the south bank of the river eamont on the monument 's north side before running 2 m beyond the outer edge of the castle 's defensive earthworks on the monument 's north west side as surveyed by the rchme in 1991 prior to completing a circuit of the monument by running sse to the field boundary flanking the b6262
a number of features are excluded from this part of the scheduling these include all modern field and garden boundaries all gates and gateposts all signposts and telegraph poles the site ticket office shop and museum all modern flagged paths a stone setted ramp leading from the road to the ticket office a septic tank and the former site ticket office and museum located in the castle 's courtyard
the ground beneath all these features however is included
the boundary of that part of the monument that includes part of the vicus and field system lying to the south of the roman fort follows the modern field boundaries which flank the b6262 to the north and moor lane to the east and which to the south runs approximately wsw north of dinglefield
to the west the boundary is defined by a line running north west from a point 2 m beyond where the excavated length of the sewage pipeline crossed the southern field boundary
while some fragmentary remains of a roman field system extend to the west of this western boundary they are not included in the scheduling because the core area of this part of the vicus and its associated field system are included within the scheduled area
a telegraph pole all modern field boundaries and all gates and gateposts are excluded from this part of the scheduling however the ground beneath these features is included
while the course of the trench containing the sewage pipeline is archaeologically sterile re excavation has the potential to disturb adjacent undisturbed deposits and it is thus included within the scheduling
the boundary of that part of the monument that includes part of the vicus and field system lying to the south east of the roman fort follows the modern field boundaries which flank moor lane to the west and the b6262 and a66 to the north
