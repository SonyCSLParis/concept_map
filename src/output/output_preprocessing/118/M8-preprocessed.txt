the castle was founded in the early 13th century on the site of a roman fort and sits near the rivers eamont and lowther
in the castles earliest form it simply consisted of a stone keep with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank with a wooden palisade
the norman family of robert de vieuxpont built the brougham castle the ruins of which can still be seen today
the vieuxponts were a powerful land- owning family in northern england owning appleby and brough castle
brougham castle in 1268 by the time of 1268 brougham castle had passed to robert clifford whose father had become lord of brougham when he married robert vieuxpoint ’s great granddaughter
with the anglo -scottish wars which started in 1296 robert clifford carried out much work at brougham to strengthen the defences
the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger more impressive stone walls and the large stone gate house was added
the importance of brougham and the clifford family was such that in 1300 edward 1 was hosted at the castle
the region was often at risk of attack from the scots and in 1388 the castle was captured and sacked
following this the clifford family began spending more time at their other castles and in particular skipton castle in yorkshire

however the earl of thanet who had inherited the clifford estates sold its furnishings in 1714
the then empty shell was left to decay as it was too costly to maintain
as a ruin brougham castle inspired a painting by j m w turner and was mentioned by william wordsworth in his poem the prelude
