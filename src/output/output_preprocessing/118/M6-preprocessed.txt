brougham just two miles outside penrith lies in the former historic county of westmorland
a roman fort originally occupied the site of the current brougham castle
the site was later taken by the norman family of vieuxpont to build their castle the ruins of which can still be seen
vieuxpont ’s castle consisted of a stone keep and service buildings surrounded by a timber pallisade
by 1268 the castle had passed to robert clifford whose father roger had become lord of brougham when he married robert vieuxpoint ’s great granddaughter
robert clifford was an important figure in the scottish wars which started in 1296 and he carried out much work at brougham to stregthen the defences
in 1643 lady anne clifford inherited the clifford estate
in 1649 when she was 60 years old she moved north and spent the next 26 years rebuilding churches and castles
skipton pendragon appleby brough and brougham castles were restored to their former glory
she died at brougham castle in the room where her father had been born in 1676
after this the castle quickley fell into ruin
you can wander through the impressive ruins of the 13th century fortress admiring its lovely location of the banks of the river eamont
the keep is the oldest part of the castle still standing the bottom three stories are from about 1175
you may explore the keep walking around the rooms which include the castle ’s hall on the first floor
on the second floor is the lord ’s chamber in which lady anne slept when she stayed here and in which she died
on the third floor is a passage all the way round within the walls and from various points you can get impressive views of the other castle buildings and the surrounding area
