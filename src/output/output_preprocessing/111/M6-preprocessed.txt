bodiam castle a national trust site overviewthis walk reveals the beautiful rolling countryside of rural east sussex and throws you the keys to the magnificent moated ruins of bodiam castle a showpiece fortress built in 1385 by the knight sir edward dalyngrigge
see a selection of photos from this walk itinerarywe meet at london charing cross station and take the train to robertsbridge a sleepy village near the sussex kent county border
many of the high street homes here are architectural relics that have changed little since their construction in the 14th century
nowadays robertsbridge is known for its world famous cricket bat factory and a small but thriving hutterite anabaptist community founded in 1971 on the site of a former tuberculosis sanatorium
departing robertsbridge we strike out to the east down the valley of the river rother
the route follows an old abandoned railway line
derelict pillboxes visible from the path show evidence of the line 's strategic importance during world war ii the british army manned these pillboxes to safeguard against german paratroopers intent on dynamiting trains
at the hamlet of bodiam we break for lunch at the castle inn
it 's a picturesque riverside pub set amongst hop fields
the highlight of the day is a tour of the national trust 's bodiam castle
although much of the castle interior was plundered during the english civil war the turrets still stand intact and can be climbed
a commanding view of the rother river valley awaits those who manage the tortuous ascent up the stone spiral staircase
our route back to robertsbridge takes us over a roman road and through apple orchards to the village of salehurst which is reputed to take its name from the many willow trees found here
salix is the latin for willow and hurst is old english for a grove thicket or shrubbery
anyway we stop off for a drink here at the excellent salehurst halt pub
