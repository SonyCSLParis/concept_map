egypt is located in northern africa3
the nile river is the heart of egypt
nile river is 4,000 miles long the longest river in the world
nile river flows north from central africa to the mediterranean sea
the nile delta is where the river splits into several channels before reaching the mediterranean
the nile flooded every year leaving behind dark rich soil that was good for farming
this area in green on the map was called the black land for the color of the soil
the area beyond the black lands were harsh deserts called the red lands 4
upper egypt is all the landsouth of the nile delta atapproximately memphis)lower egypt is the nile delta
confused why is lower egyptat the top of the map?upper egypt is further awayfrom the sea while lower egypt is at sea level so theland in lower egypt is at alower elevation than the land in upper egypt 5
egypt has natural boundaries that helped prevent invasion
harsh deserts in the west and east
red sea in the east
mediterranean sea to the north cataracts rapids on the nile to the south
invaders would have to overcome these natural boundaries before they could conquer egypt
egypt ’s natural barriers contributed to a feeling of safety and security for egyptians who prospered for over 3000 years
6 ancient egyptians were polytheistic they worshipped many god
•most gods were associated with natural forces wind rain etc or heavenly bodies moon planets stars
•two groups of gods had special importance sun gods land gods •the sun and land gods were important because of egypt ’s dependence on the sun and river lands
re sun god7 egyptians believed osiris brought civilization to egypt
the story of osiris was important to egyptians because it was symbolic for resurrection
osiris brother seth murdered him and cut his body into 14 pieces and threw the parts in the nile osiris wife isis found the pieces of osiris and with the help of other gods brought him back to life
the ancient egyptians identified with osiris and believed they could be resurrected and gain new life and be reborn
osiris isis and horus8
mummification process •bodies are washed with water from the nile
•workers remove liver lungs stomach and intestines and placed them in four special jars that were put in the tombs with the dead

the body is covered in salt to absorb the egyptians wanted to water in the body.preserve the dead for their the body was filledfuture rebirth and with spices andresurrection so they used a wrapped in linenprocess called soaked in resin.mummification
the whole process took about 70 days 9 egyptian pyramids were built primarily during the time of the old kingdom 2700 to 2200 bce
pyramids were part of large building complexes dedicated to the dead in effect a city of the dead
the city of the dead would contain a large pyramid for the pharaoh
