soter
i ancient greek πτολεμαῖος σωτήρ ptolemaĩos sōtḗr i.e. ptolemy pronounced /ˈtɒləmi/ the savior also known as ptolemy lagides,[1
c. 367 bc c. 283 bc was a macedonian general under alexander the great one of the three diadochi who succeeded to his empire
ptolemy became ruler of egypt 323–283 bc and founded a dynasty which ruled it for the next three centuries turning egypt into a hellenistic kingdom and alexandria into a center of greek culture
he assimilated to some aspects of egyptian culture however assuming the traditional title pharaoh in 305/4 bc
like all macedonian nobles ptolemy i soter claimed descent from heracles the mythical founder of the argead dynasty that ruled macedon
ptolemy 's mother was arsinoe of macedon and while his father is unknown ancient sources variously describe him either as the son of lagus a macedonian nobleman or as an illegitimate son of philip ii of macedon which if true would have made ptolemy the half brother of alexander but it is possible that this is a later myth fabricated to glorify the ptolemaic dynasty
ptolemy was one of alexander 's most trusted generals and was among the seven somatophylakes bodyguards attached to his person
he was a few years older than alexander and had been his intimate friend since childhood
he was succeeded by his son ptolemy ii philadelphus
early career[edit]ptolemy served with alexander from his first campaigns and played a principal part in the later campaigns in afghanistan and india
he participated in the battle of issus and accompanied alexander during his journey to the oracle in the siwa oasis where he was proclaimed a son of zeus
2 ptolemy had his first independent command during the campaign against the rebel bessus whom ptolemy captured and handed over to alexander for execution
3 during alexander 's campaign in the indian subcontinent ptolemy was in command of the advance guard at the siege of aornos and fought at the battle of the hydaspes river
successor of alexander[edit]when alexander died in 323 bc ptolemy is said to have instigated the resettlement of the empire made at babylon
through the partition of babylon he was appointed satrap of egypt under the nominal kings philip iii arrhidaeus and the infant alexander iv the former satrap the greek cleomenes stayed on as his deputy
ptolemy quickly moved without authorization to subjugate cyrenaica
by custom kings in macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor
probably because he wanted to pre empt perdiccas the imperial regent from staking his claim in this way ptolemy took great pains in acquiring the body of alexander the great placing it temporarily in memphis egypt
ptolemy then openly joined the coalition against perdiccas
4]perdiccas appears to have suspected ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself and may have decided that ptolemy was his most dangerous rival
ptolemy executed cleomenes for spying on behalf of perdiccas this removed the chief check on his authority and allowed ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that cleomenes had accumulated
4]rivalry and wars[edit]in 321 bc perdiccas attempted to invade egypt only to fall at the hands of his own men
5 ptolemy 's decision to defend the nile against perdiccas 's attempt to force it ended in fiasco for perdiccas with the loss of 2000 men
this failure was a fatal blow to perdiccas reputation and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates
ptolemy immediately crossed the nile to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army
ptolemy was offered the regency in place of perdiccas but he declined
6 ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed alexander
7]in the long wars that followed between the different diadochi ptolemy 's first goal was to hold egypt securely and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas cyrenaica and cyprus as well as syria including the province of judea
his first occupation of syria was in 318 and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of cyprus
when antigonus one eye master of asia in 315 showed dangerous ambitions ptolemy joined the coalition against him and on the outbreak of war evacuated syria
in cyprus he fought the partisans of antigonus and re conquered the island 313
a revolt in cyrene was crushed the same year
in 312 ptolemy and seleucus the fugitive satrap of babylonia both invaded syria and defeated demetrius poliorcetes besieger of cities the son of antigonus in the battle of gaza
again he occupied syria and again after only a few months when demetrius had won a battle over his general and antigonus entered syria in force he evacuated it
in 311 a peace was concluded between the combatants
soon after this the surviving 13 year old king alexander iv was murdered in macedonia on the orders of cassander leaving the satrap of egypt absolutely his own master
the peace did not last long and in 309 ptolemy personally commanded a fleet that detached the coastal towns of lycia and caria from antigonus then crossed into greece where he took possession of corinth sicyon and megara 308 bc
in 306 a great fleet under demetrius attacked cyprus and ptolemy 's brother menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive battle of salamis
ptolemy 's complete loss of cyprus followed
the satraps antigonus and demetrius now each assumed the title of king ptolemy as well as cassander lysimachus and seleucus i nicator responded by doing the same
in the winter of 306 bc antigonus tried to follow up his victory in cyprus by invading egypt but ptolemy was strongest there and successfully held the frontier against him
ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against antigonus
however he did send great assistance to rhodes when it was besieged by demetrius 305/304
pausanias reports that the grateful rhodians bestowed the name soter saviour upon him as a result of lifting the siege
this account is generally accepted by modern scholars although the earliest datable mention of it is from coins issued by ptolemy ii in 263 bc
when the coalition against antigonus was renewed in 302 ptolemy joined it and invaded syria a third time while antigonus was engaged with lysimachus in asia minor
on hearing a report that antigonus had won a decisive victory there he once again evacuated syria
but when the news came that antigonus had been defeated and slain by lysimachus and seleucus at the battle of ipsus in 301 he occupied syria a fourth time
the other members of the coalition had assigned all syria to seleucus after what they regarded as ptolemy 's desertion and for the next hundred years the question of the ownership of southern syria i.e. judea produced recurring warfare between the seleucid and ptolemaic dynasties
henceforth ptolemy seems to have mingled as little as possible in the rivalries between asia minor and greece he lost what he held in greece but reconquered cyprus in 295/294
cyrene after a series of rebellions was finally subjugated about 300 and placed under his stepson magas
successor[edit]in 289 ptolemy made his son by berenice ptolemy ii philadelphus his co regent
his eldest legitimate son ptolemy keraunos whose mother eurydice the daughter of antipater had been repudiated fled to the court of lysimachus
ptolemy also had a consort in thaïs the athenian hetaera and one of alexander 's companions in his conquest of the ancient world
ptolemy i soter died in 283 at the age of 84
shrewd and cautious he had a compact and well ordered realm to show at the end of forty years of war
his reputation for bonhomie and liberality attached the floating soldier class of macedonians and other greeks to his service and was not insignificant nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives
he was a ready patron of letters founding the great library of alexandria
8]he himself wrote a history of alexander 's campaigns that has not survived
this was long considered an objective work distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety
arrian of nicomedia author of the most widely read account of alexander the great noted that he relied most heavily on ptolemy 's history because as he himself was a king mendacity would have been more dishonorable for him than for anyone else
9 however as noted by a.b. bosworth an expert on greek history ptolemy may have exaggerated his own role and had propagandist aims in writing his history
10]euclid[edit]ptolemy personally sponsored the great mathematician euclid but found euclid 's seminal work the elements too difficult to study so he asked if there were an easier way to master it
according to proclus euclid famously quipped sire there is no royal road to geometry
11]fictional portrayals[edit]ptolemy was played by virgilio teixeira in the film alexander the great 1956 and by robert earley elliot cowan and anthony hopkins in the oliver stone film alexander 2004
