everything fromreligion to architecture to art has been handed down generation by generation to us inthe present day
although many of the ancient egyptians traditions have been modified oraltered the majority of their core principles remains constant
yet despite the ancient egyptians conservative nature there were some changes within the infrastructure of theirsociety
throughout the ages known as the old kingdom middle kingdom and new kingdom there has been alterations to their religion art and architecture
internal forces as well as outside influences have molded ancient egyptian civilization
this paper willattempt to determine these forces which changed the egyptians
modifications of egyptian life were subtle but noticeable and significant nonetheless
art architecture andreligion will be the focus of this paper
let us begin at the beginning with the old kingdom
the old kingdom began in the year 2700 b.c. and ended 2200 b.c. thepharaohs or kings of this time include the third through the sixth dynasty beginning with djoser and ending with pepi ii djoser who ruled from 2700 b.c. to 2650 b.c. changedhis name to the more commonly known zoser
it was zoser who made the famed step pyramid the first pyramid to be constructed
pyramids were erected for the pharaoh in the belief that it would serve as astairway to the heavens and allow the divine pharaoh to reach the milky way or the nileriver in the sky
the pharaoh 's afterlife was extremely dependent on a proper burial aswere the afterlives of those who served him therefore it was imperative that the pyramidsbe erected
these pyramids could not have been built through coercion or slavery forsuch an architectural feat could only have been accomplished by a labor force of 70,000,and there is no possible way for a small group of rulers to force the people to labor day inand day out without some kind of reward in the afterlife
previously no such architectural feat had ever been dreamed of let alone actuallythought out and complete
the properties of stone massiveness strength and durability had not even be contemplated by masons and architects yet under the guidance of imhotep the royal architect of the pharaoh zoser this magnificent structure was erected(david 14
it is of little wonder why the greeks when they listed the seven wonders ofthe world placed the great step pyramid at the top
by the fourth dynasty the pharaohs were buried in true pyramids that is all sideswere flat planes meeting at some certain point and the angle of each corner was 52degrees
the three built at gizeh for cheops chephren and mycenrinus were the peakof achievement of this field
the pyramids were of better architecture more advanceddesign and longer durability however by the fifth dynasty the pyramids weresignificantly smaller and the construction was of a lower quality the result of which can beseen today the pyramids of the fifth dynasty are little more than mounds of rubble david14
the reason for the decline in the pyramids has to do with the shifting of power dueto new religious attitudes
the religion of the ancient egyptians was rather complex
creation was believedto have been made out of darkness and chaos
with the physical creation of earth mankind and gods came the abstract concepts of law religion ethics and kingship
those were to last for eternity which solidifies the notion that ancient egyptians werevery conservative
they believed there was no change the universe worked according toa certain pattern governed by principles laid down at the beginning of time
ancientegyptians took the seasons to mean life was a cylindrical process and that there was lifeafter death david 81
there were two distinct groups of gods local and state and household
thehousehold gods were the gods of the people they protected the poor who worshippedthem in their own humble surroundings david 78
these deities possessed no temples oftheir own and had no religious doctrines but it was to these gods the people offered theirprayers to
the local gods were usually animal such as bastet the cat goddess or sobeck the crocodile god
when the chief of a particular village came into state power itwas his local god that became a nationally renowned state god
the first god to do thiswas re the sun god
he had a steady rise in power beginning in the second dynasty andby the fifth dynasty re was considered the chief god of state
it was believed that the pharaoh was a god himself and that his power was to berevered and worshipped
such was the case with zoser and the pharaohs of thepreceding dynasties
but the priesthood that worshipped re began a slow steadyusurpation of power from the pharaohs in the fifth dynasty
the divinity of the pharaohwas reduced in magnitude he was no longer a god himself but merely the son of the god re david 16
the decline in the quality as well as the size of pyramids were the result ofthis shift in power
the art of the time flourished nowhere else like it did in egypt
art in the old kingdom was not simply for beauty but for utility as well
everything was to have apurpose
for that reason statues were not erected in marketplaces but rather in a templewhere they might serve some practical purpose in the afterlife breasted 102
eventually the pharaohs themselves became a major contributor in their owndownfall
there were marriages of non royal women as was the case with pepi i. thisled to the belief that the divinity of the royal line was diluted thereby reducing thepharaoh 's power
in addition the royal treasury was rapidly being depleted due tomaintenance costs of pyramids the construction of new pyramids and numerous gifts tothe priesthood and nobles
it was n't long before the priesthood and the nobles were aswealthy as the pharaoh himself david 16
after pepi ii central government was completely lost and anarchy reigned
itwasn't until the middle kingdom that egypt began to recapture the glory it once held
this era endured from 2050 b.c. until 1800 b.c. and included the twelfth dynasty(wilson vvi
pyramids were once again being used to bury the pharaohs after a lapse wherekings were buried in rock hewn tombs during the first intermediate period but were neveranywhere near the size and splendor of those built in the old kingdom
there were newpyramids at lisht dahshur el lahun and hawara
there were also a great number oftemples erected most of which were later dismantled and incorporated in the structure ofother temples david 20
the once absolute sun god re was replaced by the god osiris
the appeal of osiris was that he promised a more democratic afterlife the common man could lookforward to his own life after death
osiris began as an obscure local god and rose to greatpower due to the wide public appeal
the myth of osiris has its root in mortality
supposedly king osiris was a humanking who established order and brought the elements of civilization to his people
hisjealous and evil brother seth had murdered him to gain osiris throne a plot not unlikethat of shakespeare 's hamlet
isis osiris wife fled to the delta of the nile and gave birthto osiris son horus posthumously
there she trained horus to extract their revengeupon seth
when the confrontation between seth and horus occurred both were severelyinjured but it was horus who finally defeated seth
through powerful charms placed by isis osiris was restored to life albeit as a king of the dead and judge of the underworld
the charm that osiris had over other deities was the fact that he was once human and had triumphed over death
this bears striking resemblance to christian 's beliefs that jesus had died and was resurrected
isis had become the symbol for a loving and devotedwife horus was the embodiment of a courageous and righteous son whereas sethbecame the symbol of absolute evilness
this too bears an uncanny resemblance to many christian beliefs isis could be compared to the virgin mary and satan to seth
althoughgreat changes were made in religion even greater advances in egyptian art were evident
the middle kingdom bore witness to the finest pieces of jewelry ever crafted in egypt
craftsmen used semi precious stones inlaid in gold and laden with numerousdesigns to grace the crowns armlets and collars worn by the royal princesses david 20
once again the pharaoh was supreme and this is reflected in the sculptures of them asthere is a grim determination and disillusionment about the features perhaps to guardagainst such mistakes that were made in the old kingdom
in addition the middle kingdom was renowned for it 's literary masterpieces
theshipwrecked sailor was the first literary piece to have a story within a story
in addition the hieroglyphic language of the period is today regarded as the classical form and"middle egyptian is the first stage of the language which would be egyptologists learn
the middle kingdom came to an end when the hyksos invaded egypt and tookover
it was n't until 1465 b.c. that egypt regained control of their country
the ensuingera known as the new kingdom lasted from 1465 b.c. until 1165 b.c. the new kingdom included the eighteenth through twentieth dynasty
it was theeighteenth dynasty that produced a series of active able pharaohs who conquered manylands and brought prosperity back to egypt
pyramids were no longer used as burialgrounds instead the famed valley of kings is the final resting place for the pharaohs ofthis age
the tombs were hewn out of the native rock sadly with the exception of tutankhamun many of them fell victim to grave robbers
the religion of this period would take a drastic turn
the god re came back intopower when he was unified with another god called amun
this new god was known as amun re and was once again the focus of the priesthood
this priesthood was gaininggreat strength as they did at the end of the old kingdom by selling magic charms andelixirs to the common people with promises that it will aid in their passage to a favorableafterlife
the pharaoh amenhotep iv made a revolutionary change in the whole religioussystem by disbanding the priesthood defiling all of the old temples and placing in power anew god aton
amenhotep would change his name which meant amun rests to akhenaton which meant aton is satisfied
 the significance of such a movement was that it was the earliest form ofmonotheism
all previous ages practiced one form or another of polytheism with roomfor an unlimited number of gods and goddesses
with this new religion the only supremepowers were aton and akhenaton himself
aton was not embodied in an animal or humanform but rather in terms of the life giving warming rays of the sun
aton was not simplythe god of egypt but a god of the entire universe
this god was to be thought of abenevolent father overseeing all of his followers from high above in the heavens
he wasthe source of all truth and justice and he would reward those who followed his laws
this new form of religion did not last for akhenaton disappeared fifteen yearsafter the beginning of his reign and the old beliefs came back
akhenaton did more than simply form a new religion he started the art form ofnaturalism
this was partly because he wished to break all ties with the former religion and partly because it was the teaching of aton which stated that all things must be admiredas they appear in aton 's desired state
the artwork of this period of time is also the mostsought after for therein lies the clearest picture of an ancient egyptian possible david18
eventually internal struggles led to the weakening of egypt until they were finallyconquered by the greeks
but the legacy of ancient egypt lives on in a great number ofour beliefs today
we base much of our culture upon the lives of ancient egyptians fromart to architecture to the basis of western religion that being christianity
ancientegypt 's glorious reign lasted two and a half millennia and that fact alone makes egypt aremarkable and notable society for we are all sobbing babes compared to the longevityand stability of ancient egypt
