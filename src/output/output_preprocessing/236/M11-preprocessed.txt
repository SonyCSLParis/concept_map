the colony brazil is located in south america
brazil is by far the largest country in south america taking up almost 50 of the subcontinent
before colonization brazil was populated by a range of amerindian peoples large groups were the tupi guarani gê and arawak
the first europeans to explore brazil were the portuguese who landed on the brazilian coast in 1500 and claimed brazil for portugal
the first permanent settlement was established in 1532 effective colonization started in 1534
the portuguese developed brazil as a plantations colony sugar cane being the most important crop
to man the plantations slaves were brought from africa
initially the colonization of brazil was limited to the coastal regions
in the 18th century gold was found which led to the exploration and colonization of the interior
independencewhen napoleon threatened to conquer the iberian peninsula in europe the portuguese moved the royal court from lisbon to rio de janeiro in 1808
to give brazil a status to match the presence of the royal court it was proclaimed a kingdom in 1815
in 1822 the king moved the court back to portugal leaving his heir pedro as regent to rule brazil
pedro in the same year declared the independence of brazil and as pedro i assumed the title of emperor of the empire of brazil
brazilian independence was recognized by portugal in 1825
the empire the empire was ruled as a constitutional parliamentary monarchy with a large amount of self government for the provinces
pedro i moved to portugal in 1831 leaving the throne to his heir pedro ii
as pedro ii had not yet come of age a regent was appointed
the period of the regency saw conflicts between the many factions in the empire escalate
in 1843 pedro ii took the reigns in his own hands and proved to be a capable ruler
pedro ii developed into the binding factor in the empire settling conflicts on both the national and the local level
the political stability in the second half of the 19th century translated into strong economic growth attracting large numbers of immigrants from europe
in the last quarter of the century however the influence of the emperor waned
in 1889 the military deposed the emperor through a coup and proclaimed the republic of brazil officially the republic of the united states of brazil the provinces becoming states
the official name would be changed to federative republic of brazil in 1967
establishing the borders in the age of discovery portugal and spain the two main seafaring nations of the time had defined their respective spheres of interest in the western hemisphere by way of the 1494 treaty of tordesillas
a line was drawn 370 leagues west of cape verde
lands to the east would belong to portugal lands to the west to spain
the treaty seems to have been effective to a certain extent but in brazil reality proved different
by the 18th century portugal had explored and colonized lands well west of the line in the tordesillas treaty
a further treaty signed in 1777 defined the borders between the portuguese and spanish possessions reflecting the reality of the moment
when the portuguese and spanish possessions gained independence disputes about the borders again ensued
most of these disputes were settled by negotiation in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries
the exception is the border with paraguay paraguay had to cede part of its territory as an outcome of the triple alliance war
the disputes may have seemed substantial on the scale of the neighboring countries on the scale of brazil they would seem to be of a relatively minor impact
involvement in war during its existence the empire has been involved in three wars that were related to the process of nation building in neighboring argentina and uruguay
the cisplatine war fought from 1825 to 1828 in uruguay ended brazilian occupation of uruguay and led to independence of uruguay
in the platine war fought from 1851 to 1852 in argentina and the uruguayan war fought from 1864 to 1865 in uruguay brazil supported factions in these respective countries during one of the many civil wars these countries have known
both wars ended in success the factions brazil had supported gaining power
the major war the empire would be involved in was the triple alliance war
this war was initiated by paraguay that had expansionist ambitions and probably the most developed military in south america
the war is considered to have been the largest military conflict in the history of south america
paraguay soon faced an alliance of argentina brazil and uruguay
the alliance came out victorious and paraguay faced utter defeat
the republic from 1889 to 1930 brazil was ruled as a constitutional democracy a democracy to which only the oligarchy had access
in the 1910 elections just over 0.6 million people had the right to vote out of a population of 22 million
in 1930 the military brought getúlio vargas a civilian to power and a civilian dictatorship was established
the state of são paulo revolted in 1932 initiating an armed conflict
the revolt was soon put down by the federal government but some of the demands were met
the vargas dictatorship would last until 1945 when democracy was restored
vargas would dominate brazilian politics until 1954 albeit now in a democratic setting
suspected reforms land reforms and nationalization of private companies would cause the military to seize power again in 1964
the military dictatorship lasted until 1985
although democratic rights were suspended the dictatorship enjoyed considerable popularity not in the least through its successful economic policies
since democracy was restored in 1985 brazil has been governed by democratically elected presidents
economy and demographics the brazilian economy was traditionally centered around agriculture
in the 20th century the economy has been diversified and mining manufacturing and service sectors have developed

the first stamps issued by the republic show the stars of the southern cross and are inscribed e.u do brazil short for estados unidos do brazil or united states of brazil

depending on the catalog used between 145 and 168 major numbers are listed
the series counts only 11 designs but these have been issued unwatermarked with 11 different watermarks on different types of paper in different types of print with different perforations and in different colors

brazil has until the present day mainly issued stamps with themes of national interest
british and french offices operated in bahia salvador pernambuco recife and rio de janeiro
the british offices used the general issues of great britain from 1866 to 1874
the french offices used the general issues of france from 1860
the state of são paulo when it revolted against the federal government issued stamps in 1932
the stamps show themes of the revolt and are inscribed pró constituição
the revolt in the state of são paulo is also called the constitutionalist revolution as the initial goal was to force the federal government to adopt a new constitution since the federal government led by the dictator vargas had abrogated the constitution in 1930
airline issues just as the development of the railways had been a boost for the development of postal services in europe the advent of aviation was a boost for the development of postal services in south america
in brazil three airlines were given concessions to provide postal services and to issue stamps
these stamps had to be used in addition to the general issues of the brazilian postal authorities to cover the cost of the service by air
the following airlines have issued stamps eta the eta short for empreza de transportes aereos or company of aerial transport was a small italian brazilian airline that operated flights between rio de janeiro and campos and between rio de janeiro and são paulo
stamps were issued in 1929
the company was taken over by an american company in late 1929 and ended its services early 1930
condor the condor airline in full condor syndicato ltda was a german brazilian airline founded in 1927 that operated flights from porte alegre to rio de janeiro and natal
stamps were issued from 1927 to 1930
condor operated agencies in several brazilian cities and also in berlin and danzig
in 1930 the private issues of the condor airline were superseded by the air post stamps of brazil
the condor airline was taken over by varig in 1993
varig varig is short for viação aerea riograndense or air transport rio grande
varig also a german brazilian airline and a sister company of the condor airline was founded in 1927
it operated flights in the rio grande del sul state of brazil
