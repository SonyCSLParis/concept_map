pedro i and pedro iibrazil ’s history in the nineteenth century was dramatically shaped by events in europe namely the ascendancy of napoleon bonaparte to the throne of france and his subsequent conquest of much of continental europe including the iberian peninsula
as napoleon ’s forces marched on portugal which had been a consistent ally of the britain france ’s nemesis the royal court fled for the new world establishing a court in rio de janeiro in 1808
during his 13 year stay in rio dom joão vi brought a number of european style institutions to the city a printing press an opera house naval and military academies and much more so much so that even after napoleon ’s defeat and exile the portuguese monarch did not want to return to the court in lisbon
he found himself more comfortable in brazil
by choosing a far away colony as a seat of power joão angered other european countries
his solution was to elevate brazil to a monarchy and make himself de facto ruler of two nations
still his subjects and british allies clamored for his return and so in 1821 joão left his son prince pedro as regent in brazil and returned to europe coronation of pedro ibrazil ’s independence from portugal was a relatively anticlimactic event there was no war no act of congress no overthrow of the government
with dom joão back in lisbon the portuguese cortes parliament attempted to restore brazil to colonial status
but pedro as regent rejected their attempts
on january 9 1822 he officially and publicly announced his refusal to obey an order from parliament that he return to portugal
that day is now known as the dia do fico a brazilian holiday for pedro ’s proclamation i shall remain
pedro was lucky
his decision matched public opinion among brazilian landowners and bureaucrats who reflected important political interests
the divide between portugal and brazil widened until september of 1822 when pedro rejected a final decree from portugal with the statement independência ou morte
independence or death from there he went on with the business of establishing the new empire of brazil clearing out portuguese loyalists within his government but making no changes to the existing socio economic order
in this account father belchior pinheira de oliveira a confidant of prince pedro describes the exact moment of the declaration of independence just after the prince has received the cortes demand that he return
accompanied by me cordeiro bregaro carlota and others d. pedro silently walked toward our horses at the side of the road
suddenly he halted in the middle of the road and said to me father belchior they asked for it and they will get it
the côrtes is persecuting me and calling me an adolescent and a brazilian
well now let them see their adolescent in action
from today on our relations with them are finished
i want nothing more from the portuguese government and i proclaim brazil forevermore separated from portugal
with enthusiasm we immediately answered long live liberty
long live an independent brazil
long live d. pedro
the prince turned to his adjutant and said tell my guard that i have just declared the complete independence of brazil
we are free from portugal
lieutenant canto e melo rode toward a market where most of the soldiers of the guard remained
he returned to the prince with them shouting enthusiastically in favor of an independent and separate brazil d. pedro and the catholic religion
d. pedro before the guard said the portuguese côrtes wants to enslave and to persecute us
henceforth our relations are broken
not one tie unites us
burns 199)what according to father belchior ’s account were pedro ’s concerns in breaking away from portugal
what do his declaration and his supporters response indicate about the likely changes to the regime after independence
here debret presents a grand theatrical interpretation of the ascendancy of emperor pedro i and the separation of brazil from the kingdom of portugal
framed by a curtain and flanked by symbols of the new nation ’s independence the former prince regent takes center stage
debret is at once conveying two messages that later artists would frequently reiterate that brazil is a separate entity with its own history and that despite its differences with the old world its peoples can see it as a peer of the long standing civilizations that came before it
the decision to label the new government an empire rather than a kingdom was a calculated and political one roman emperors were divinely supported but did not receive their earthly power from their blood as pedro would have in lisbon following the death of his father joao vi
in theory at least a roman emperor received a mandate from the people to rule on their behalf
lacking an imperial history of its own brazil adopted another ’s
as pedro holds the new constitution the diverse peoples around him cheer and clamor for his rule
white and black parents put their children forward as if waiting for them to be blessed while bandeirantes pledge their allegiance and a soldier fires a cannon in celebration
notice in the shadows to the left and right of the throne the indian civilians and warriors respectively the presence of indigenous peoples was an oft invoked piece of evidence for brazilian history
in 1862 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the coronation debret acclaims here elites in rio de janeiro unveiled an equestrian statue of pedro i native brazilians are carved beneath the triumphal national monument as a means of reminding viewers that the country had a past before the portuguese
some other details are worth observing
the boat in the far left foreground is carrying coffee and sugar the two most important crops at the time of this painting
the old man on the right is from sao paulo while his grandson upon whom he is leaning is from minas gerais
finally the entire scene is consecrated by heraldic angels and three cherubim carrying a crowned orb with the letter p presumably for pedro
this orb resembles the imperial coat of arms which also decorated the national flag until the empire ’s end in 1889
portraits of a king and an emperor the man in the images on the left is king joão vi and the man on the right is the emperor pedro i.
what does the difference in attire of these two men reflect about their political positions
what is the value in comparing them side by side
what are the similarities and differences between them comparisons of rio de janeiro why did debret show these two images the close up of the palace and the long view of the coastline together
how does one complement the other
what assumptions can be made about the economy and social structure of rio de janiero from these images
how does the plaza depicted in this image differ from the one shown in debret ’s vue de la place de palais à rio de janiero
what kinds of people are shown and what kinds of tasks are they doing
how does the architecture differ from that of the aforementioned image arrival of princess leopoldine what does this illustration say about the brazilian monarchy
how is the princess welcomed to brazil
how does the illustration reflect both european and brazilian values in terms of its setting its people and its architecture pedro ii
assumes leadership the focal point of this debret painting hard to see from afar is standing on a chair
in 1831 under pressure from the brazilian military and the portuguese monarchy dom pedro i returned to portugal to assume the throne his father had died five years earlier leaving his son pedro ii as the claimant to the brazilian imperial seat of power
pedro ii was five years old at the time so a triumvirate of regents was arranged planning to rule the country until the young emperor reached age 18
here we see the symbolic acclamation of the new leader who waves to the crowd from a balcony in the upper left while in military dress
for the brazilian elites the continued existence of an emperor was vital from a symbolic point of view
although liberals and conservatives split on how power should be centralized in this still young government they supported the regents plan all the same
the men on horseback closest to pedro ’s balcony represent the different sectors of rio de janeiro the capital city from 1793 to 1960
behind the line of soldiers in the center notice the celebrating men many of whom are holding branches which were meant to symbolize the national colors green and gold
all the revelers appear to be well off if not elite
there are no clearly poor people in this audience but they were not as invested in preserving the status quo as the elites who wanted to ward off any potential political tumult that might accompany a change of power
indeed following a series of small revolts in the 1830s that questioned the empire ’s legitimacy and what brazil stood for the country ’s elites pushed for pedro ii to assume power four years early
he did so in 1840 and would rule the second empire for the next 59 years
