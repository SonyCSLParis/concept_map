following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s economic growth for uruguay averaged 8 annually during the period 2004 08
the 2008 09 global financial crisis put a brake on uruguay 's vigorous growth which decelerated to 2.6 in 2009
nevertheless the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates mainly through higher public expenditure and investment and gdp growth reached 8.9 in 2010 but slowed in 2012 13 the result of a renewed slowdown in the global economy and in uruguay 's main trade partners and common market of the south mercosur counterparts argentina and brazil
uruguay has sought to expand trade within mercosur and with non mercosur members
uruguay 's total merchandise trade with mercosur since 2006 has increased by nearly 70 to more than $ 5 billion while its total trade with the world has almost doubled to roughly $ 23 billion in 2013
characterized by large and well developed agricultural mining manufacturing and service sectors and a rapidly expanding middle class brazil 's economy outweighs that of all other south american countries and brazil is expanding its presence in world markets
since 2003 brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability building up foreign reserves and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments
in 2008 brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt
after strong growth in 2007 and 2008 the onset of the global financial crisis hit brazil in 2008
brazil experienced two quarters of recession as global demand for brazil 's commodity based exports dwindled and external credit dried up
however brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery
in 2010 consumer and investor confidence revived and gdp growth reached 7.5 the highest growth rate in the past 25 years
rising inflation led the authorities to take measures to cool the economy these actions and the deteriorating international economic situation slowed growth in 2011 13
unemployment is at historic lows and brazil 's traditionally high level of income inequality has declined for each of the last 14 years
brazil 's historically high interest rates have made it an attractive destination for foreign investors
large capital inflows over the past several years have contributed to the appreciation of the currency hurting the competitiveness of brazilian manufacturing and leading the government to intervene in foreign exchange markets and raise taxes on some foreign capital inflows
president dilma rousseff has retained the previous administration 's commitment to inflation targeting by the central bank a floating exchange rate and fiscal restraint gdp purchasing power parity $ 56.27 billion 2013 est
