history of brazilian law the 1824 constitutionstrong > immediately after the portuguese crown won the battle against napoleon in 1821 king dom joão vi returned to lisbon leaving his oldest son dom pedro
i as crown prince in his stead
after a series of disputes prince pedro aligned with brazilian factions and declared the country ’s independence on september 7 1822
brazil ’s first constitution was drafted and adopted in turbulent times and without popular support
as the battle lines hardened pedro i on 12 november 1823 called for a constitutional convention
a factional dispute quickly erupted
the convention wanted to impose a north american style liberal democracy whereas pedro i coming from an absolutist tradition wanted a constitutional monarchy reflecting the french model
on march 25 1824 the convention ’s delegates had finished their work and pedro i imposed brazil ’s first constitution and established himself as brazil ’s first emperor
as such pedro i prevailed in imposing a continuing monarchy
the first two brazilian law schools were established in são paulo and olinda in 1827
the main goal in establishing these law schools was to form the new upcoming brazilian elite
thereafter the first statutes were gradually enacted
for example brazil ’s first criminal code was enacted in 1830 followed by the commercial code in 1850 of note no civil code was enacted during this period
nonetheless the 1824 constitution also known as constituiҫão política do império do brasil governed the country for the six decades following independence 1822 1889
moreover during this period two emperors pedro i and pedro ii as the descendants of king joão vi ruled as head of the executive during consecutive reigns
the first half of pedro i and ii ’s rule is called the primeiro reinado
for this part pedro i 1822 1831 based his reign in part on a literal imitation of the french restoration constitutions
in addition to a constitutional monarchy with the emperor as ruler the first magna carta also established for the first time the separation of powers as one of its core components
article 95 of the imperial constitution enshrined montesquieu ’s democratic idea by establishing the three branches of government the legislative executive and judiciary as equal and institutionally independent authorities
but in contrast to montesquieu ’s classical model the brazilian imperial constitution implemented in articles 98 101 a unique fourth branch called the moderator or the moderating power poder moderador
this fourth branch ’s task was to coordinate the three traditional powers in order to stabilize the new constitutional order and maintain the new national identity
in fact pedro i used the poder moderador as a means to centralize and concentrate power for his benefit
during this time although the parliament exercised nominal control of the constitutional mandates it was pedro i as head of the executive who had final word in all major public and constitutional matters
for example pedro i was authorized to appoint and dismiss ministers article 101 paragraph 6 to suspend judges article 101 paragraph 7 to select senators to dissolve the house of representatives article 101 paragraph 5 among other powers
a council would normally advise the emperor on these issues but his power was broad sacred and inviolable
contrary to pedro i ’s traditional monarchical reign pedro ii initiated the segundo reinado 1831 1889 as a political and cooperative leader
the primary point in contention between the monarchy on one hand and influential nobles and landowners on the other was slavery
although the slavery trade was outlawed in 1850 through the law eusébio de queirós slavery itself was not wholly banned
later in 1871 congress passed the lei do ventre livre that granted freedom to the children of slaves born from the effective date of the law and thereafter
finally on may 13 1888 slavery was completely abolished by the golden law lei áurea
the 1891 constitution on november 15 1889 however pedro ii ’s reign came to an end
the brazilian nobility joined by the upper classes and the brazilian army forced the pedro ii into exile
the emperor ’s exile formed the way for a new beginning
brazil ’s new beginning is also known as the república velha whereby brazil ceased its existence as part of an empire and began its history as a republic
indeed the establishment of federalism a republican government and a presidential system each constituted a reflection of the north american constitution
on december 3 1889 a decree was enacted to convene a special judicial commission to draw up a draft for the new constitution ante projeto
this group of experts known as the comissão dos cinco met for the first time in january 1890 led by saldanha marinho
rui barbosa a brazilian jurist and politician was responsible for the important task of correcting the design of the new constitution
after the provisional revolutionary cabinet approved the new constitution it was published and the substitute government the governo provisório came into being
on november 15 1890 exactly one year after the end of pedro ii ’s reign the newly established brazilian congress came together for the first time
the provisional government decreed that the 205 representatives and 63 senators within one month adopt a proposed constitution
the brazilian congress then invoked a constitutional commission on november 22 1890
the commission was known as the famous 21 comissão dos 21 and presented a final draft on february 21 1891
three days later the comissão dos 21 officially announced its publication the constituiҫão da república dos estados unidos do brasil constitution of the republic of the united states of brazil dated of 24 february 1891
the representatives grand hopes for the new constitution is inherent in the following statement after 15 months the revolutionary government enters into the state of law
our homeland has from now on a liberal democratic constitution that allows for a progressive development and wealth just like the north american model it was the united states constitution rather than the constitutions of brazil ’s iberian neighbors europe and even its own constitutional innovations such as the first republican constitution project projeto constituiҫão da república rio gran dense dated of 08 february 1843 that served as a model for brazil ’s first republican constitution
other semantic parallels such as the renaming of the imperial bicameral parliament of assembléia geral which was the brazilian equivalent of the u.s. national congress congresso nacional with a senate senado federal and a house of representatives câmara dos deputados each demonstrate the inspirational supremacy of north america
at the end of the 19th century the u.s. constitution had been very successful in overcoming crises
even the american civil war 1861 1865 could do nothing to change the firmness of its basic constitutional ideals
but success in north america is only one explanation for the strong influence of the u.s. constitution the 1891 constitution ’s framers simply had no time for experiments
indeed the popular support for the republican coup golpe republicano had been limited
as such the new government was operating in an ideological vacuum
it was revolutionary but at the same time self appointed
the framers were aware that the transition from monarchy to republic had to be completed quickly
extreme time pressure and the politically fragile environment of the brazilian constitution of 1891 were used as a justification to rush the rescue officially it was said that the framers of the constitution of the republic as then set out in rio de janeiro seemingly and unconditionally copied the u.s. model either to enforce the liberal democratic enlightenment modernity or to safeguard the economic well understood interests of the nation
the extent of the importance of such rhetorical legitimization may be found there
nonetheless the role model of the u.s. constitution can be particularly seen in the area of the executive power
set out in article 44 the president was to be elected for a term of four years although without the possibility of re election article 43
moreover as in the u.s. constitution the president of brazil was also the supreme commander of the armed forces article 48
additionally the office of the emperor and the office of the poder moderador disappeared
instead of a fourth branch a complicated check and balance system based on the american legal experience was established to ensure competition and balance among the branches
henceforth the president should govern and the congress would control it article 34
along with the new constitution ’s de concentration of political power came the decentralization of the unitary state
the central government had been dissolved and the former provinces of the empire turned into largely self governing states
furthermore and perhaps as most important or at least most durable and enduring innovation concerned the judiciary
the third branch until then organizationally subordinate to the emperor was chosen as the voice of the liberal constitutional state
the new supremo tribunal federal article 59 and 60 was similar not only in name but also in its similarity to the u.s. supreme court being the highest federal court and guardian of the constitution
moreover under the constitution of 1891 the judges known as cabinet ministers were appointed for life by the president of the supremo tribunal federal subject to senate approval article 48 no 12
the aim of such power article 57 was to ensure the greatest possible independence of judges
except in cases of severe infraction of the law it was not possible to remove judges from their legal duties
the supremo tribunal federal had jurisdiction to review standards and government acts not only regarding their constitutionality but also as the last appellate court binding all parties and departments with its constitutional rulings
an important component of the comprehensive judicial reform of 1891 was still in force the dichotomous organizational structure of state and federal courts known as justiҫa estadual or justiҫa federal
with the establishment of the constitutional courts individual liberties were protected under a new constitutional light
the fourth title of the constitution of 1891 enumerated not only individual fundamental rights but also identified an individual claim system especially in the form of habeas corpus art 72 78
one of the characteristics of brazil ’s domestic policies was the friction between powerful states
for most part of the first republic two influential and economically successful states são paulo and minas gerais were through mutual commitments and under the umbrella of the federal government the most influential states in the nation
but the global economic crisis in the late 1920s also gripped brazil and triggered conflicts between these two states to escalate
the military stepped in and deconstructed the form of government established in 1889
a junta appointed getúlio vargas as the provisional president he held this position for the next fifteen years
the 1934 constitution the 1930 revolution resulting from a dispute between the states são paulo and minas gerais led to getúlio vargas being elected president in that same year
in 1932 a constitutionalist revolution came to place as an answer from the opposing forces to the vargas government but two years later in 1934 getúlio ratified brazil ’s next constitution and succeeded remaining in power for another decade
from a comparative law perspective the 1934 constitution reflected particular appreciation of germany ’s weimar constitution
it contained a large number of the same constitutional provisions in part verbatim
there was little doubt that its framers conceived the concepts of social law as a core characteristic to be imported as a new constitutional ideal
this new approach established amongst others provisions on family education and culture articles 144 158 social realignment of the brazilian economic order art 115 145
it provided for a secret ballot compulsory voting for those above the age of 18 and for the first time in the brazilian history women were then allowed to vote
it also provided for the creation of the labor courts and electoral courts
the constitution of 1934 was written with the sole purpose of organizing a democratic regime and assuring the nation unity liberty justice and social and economical welfare
notwithstanding its glorious goals its principles were never taken too seriously hence why this was brazil ’s shortest living constitution
the 1937 constitution getúlio vargas remained as president from 1930 to 1945
during his term two constitutions were passed but unlike the first one the constitution of 1937 was not well welcomed
vargas four year term was to expire in 1938 but before it happened vargas announced on national radio that a communist plot the cohen plan was on the verge of overthrowing the democratic government
by doing so he created a favorable atmosphere to stay in his position and broaden his presidential powers
as a consequence on november 30 1937 vargas established the estado novo new state by performed several acts that were contrary to the 1934 constitution and finally announced the promulgation of brazil ’s newest constitution that effectively placed most if not all legislative and presidential powers in his hands
in the constitution ’s preamble the new government tries to explain the reasoning behind the new state given the legitimate aspirations of the brazilin people to peace and social policy deeply disturbed by factors causing disorder resulting from the increasing aggravation of bargaining parties given the apprehensive state created in the country by the communist infiltration which becomes each day more extensive and deeper requiring remedies of a radical and permanent character we decide to ensure the nation its unity respect for their honor and independence and to the brazilian people under a policy of peace and social conditions necessary for their safety their well being and prosperity by decreeing the following constitution which will become the paramount law of the country today vargas intention was to develop industrialization and improve the lower class agrarian lifestyle
the 1937 established amongst other things the concentration of executive and legislative powers in the hands of the president indirect elections for president for a term of six years government intervention in the economy death penalty the end of the workers right to go on strike nationalization of the subsoil and waterfalls in the country
the authoritarian and centralist constitution of 1937 lined up with the ongoing fascist political models in europe breaking the tradition of liberal constitutions previously prevailing in the country
most individual rights disappeared citizens were apprehended and imprisoned for supporting or having any suspicious involvement with the communist party and vargas thus prevailed in centralizing all government powers in his own figure
the 1946 constitution the 1946 constitution was promulgated on september 18 1946
eurico gaspar dutra then president of the country convoked a constituent assembly that drafted the new constitution
the basic individual rights were re established
the draft included amongst others the equality of all citizens freedom of expressions uncensored inviolability of the secrecy of correspondence freedom of conscience belief and practice of one ’s religion freedom of association for lawful purposes inviolability of one ’s home extinction of the death penalty and the true separation of powers
during the term of the 1946 constitution the military coup of 1964 happened
the coup involved a series of events that culminated with the overthrow of president joão goulard by the armed forces supported by the united states
from that moment on the constitution went through a series of amendments that fully eliminated its democratic character and then finally it was replaced by a new constitution a few years later
the 1967 constitution brazil ’s new military government through its first military president humberto de alencar castelo branco enacted the fourth institutional act ai-4 and convoked congress to vote on and promulgate the new constitution
accordingly on january 24 1967 the congress acting as a constituent assembly passed a new constitution that was once again mainly characterized for its centralized power in the hands of the president
the new constitution sought to institutionalize and legalize the military regime increasing the influence of the executive branch over the legislative and judicial branches
the constitutional amendments which once went through the process of being written by the legislative and approved by the executive strategically became initiatives to be initiated exclusively and uniquely by the president
the military government just like the vargas government passed a constitution but did not really act in conformity with its articles and principles
despite being an authoritarian document both vargas and the military presidents preferred to rule using decrees
after the constitution ’s enactment multiple amendments and other institutional acts were approved
finally in 1969 again through another institutional act no 5 ai-5 mostly the constitution was edited
the changes were so significant and material that many historians and scholars consider it to be a different constitution
whether different or not the true and sad reality is that such changes were made in detriment of the brazilian citizens who ended up being the target and the ones to truly suffer the consequences of such centralized government
the 1969 constitution in 1969 the 1967 constitution received new wording through an amendment enacted by the military ministers
as mentioned before it is considered by many experts to be a new constitution despite having formally been an amendment to the previous one
the institutional act no 5 ai-5 gave allowed the president to shut down the federal congress the state congress and city chambers indefinitely to suspend political rights for 10 years and enact or extend a state of danger in the country
the ai-5 was enacted during costa e silva ’s term as president
the 1969 constitution also intensified the concentration of power in the executive and along with the institutional act no 12 ai-12 it permitted a military group to replace the former president after his absence instead of having the vice president do so which would be the legal and democratic thing to do in any republican nation
in addition to those changes the government also enacted a national security law which severely restricted civil liberties and a press law that established the federal censorship which lasted until the government of who would be come the first democratic president after the militaries were gone josé sarney
the 1988 constitution the 1988 constitution inaugurated a constitutional era marked by the prevalence of the principles over rules which thins to the ideal of justice and strains ethic practices two useful means a judge can take advantage of to decide with equity
it was enacted and promulgated by the national constituent assembly on october 5 1988
the new and still current constitution kept the presidential government and ensured that chief executive in each branch president governors and mayors was elected by the people and through a direct and secret ballot
the 1988 constitution represents the transition from an authoritarian military dictatorship to what we know as a democracy
it is known as the citizens constitution and its 245 articles is divided into nine titles
not only has the constitution of 1988 been the most democratic constitution brazil has ever had but it has also provided the country with a long period of institutional stability
the right of one ’s access to justice is provided for in article 5 section xxxv of the constitution it is thus inserted in a comprehensive list of individual rights and guarantees established in article 5
in this sense a person ’s right to have access to justice implies more than simply one ’s right of action it denotes the need to provide legal protection for fairness and effectiveness in legal suits
this follows from the fact that access to justice is a fundamental right and as such it should be interpreted in its most effective way principle of most effectiveness of fundamental rights
thereupon the aforementioned right implies at first in giving people the right to demand from the judiciary an answer to their pleadings and secondly the right for an adequate protection capable of fixing the threat or the substantive law at issue in a fair effective and reasonable way
