the brazilian earthquake the empire of chaos submitted by tyler durden on 03/10/2016 22:00 -0400authored
by pepe escobar originally posted at sputnik news.com imagine one of the most admired global political leaders in modern history taken from his apartment at 6 am by armed brazilian federal police agents and forced into an unmarked car to the sao paulo airport to be interrogated for almost four hours in connection with a billion dollar corruption scandal involving the giant state oil company petrobras
this is the stuff hollywood is made of
and that was exactly the logic behind the elaborate production
the public prosecutors of the two year old car wash investigation maintain there are elements of proof implicating lula in receiving funds at least 1.1 million euros from the dodgy kickback scheme involving major brazilian construction companies connected to petrobras
lula might and the operative word is might have personally profited from it mostly in the form of a ranch which he does not own a relatively modest seaside apartment speaking fees in the global lecture circuit and donations to his charity
lula is the ultimate political animal on a bill clinton level
he had already telegraphed he was waiting for such a gambit as the car wash machine had already arrested dozens of people suspected of embezzling contracts between their companies and petrobras to the tune of over $ 2 billion to pay for politicians of the workers party pt of which lula was leader
lula 's name surfaced via the proverbial rascal turned informer eager to strike a plea bargain
the working hypothesis there is no smoking gun is that lula when he led brazil between 2003 and 2010 personally benefited from the corruption scheme with petrobras at the center obtaining favors for himself the pt and the government
meanwhile inefficient president dilma rousseff is herself under attack engineered via a plea bargain by the former government leader in the senate
lula was questioned in connection to money laundering corruption and suspected dissimulation of assets
the hollywood blitz was cleared by federal judge sergio moro who always insists he 's been inspired by the italian judge antonio di pietro and the notorious 1990s mani pulite clean hands investigation
and here inevitably the plot thickens
round up the usual media suspects moro and the car wash prosecutors justified the hollywood blitz insisting lula refused to be interrogated
lula and the pt vehemently insist otherwise
and yet car wash investigators had consistently leaked to mainstream media words to the effect we ca n't just bite lula
when we get to him we will swallow him
 this would imply at a minimum a politicization of justice the federal police and the public ministry
and would also imply that the hollywood blitz may have been supported by a smoking gun
as perception is reality in the frenetic non stop news cycle the news instantly global was that lula was arrested because he 's corrupt
yet it gets curioser and curioser when we learn that judge moro wrote an article in an obscure magazine way back in 2004 in portuguese only titled considerations about mani pulite cej magazine issue number 26 july september 2004 where he clearly extols authoritarian subversion of juridical order to reach specific targets and using the media to intoxicate the political atmosphere
all of this serving a very specific agenda of course
in italy right wingers saw the whole mani pulite saga as a nasty judicial over reach the left on the other hand was ecstatic
the italian communist party pci emerged with clean hands
in brazil the target is the left while the right at least for the moment seems to be composed of hymn singing angels
the pampered cocaine snorting loser candidate of the 2014 brazilian presidential election aecio neves for instance was singled out for corruption by three different accusers and it all went nowhere without further investigation
same with another dodgy scheme involving former president fernando henrique cardoso the notoriously vainglorious former developmentalist turned neoliberal enforcer
what car wash has already forcefully imprinted across brazil is the perception that corruption only pays when the accused is a progressive nationalist
as for washington consensus vassals they are always angels mercifully immune from prosecution
that 's happening because moro and his team are masterfully playing to the hilt moro 's self described use of the media to intoxicate the political atmosphere with public opinion serially manipulated even before someone is formally charged with any crime
and yet moro and his prosecutors sources are largely farcical artful dodgers cum serial liars
why trust their word
because there are no smoking guns something even moro admits
and that leads us towards the nasty scenario of a made in brazil media judicial police complex possibly hijacking one of the healthiest democracies in the world
and that is supported by a stark fact the right wing brazilian opposition 's entire project boils down to ruining the economy of the 7th largest global economic power to justify the destruction of lula as a presidential candidate in 2018
elite plundering rules none of the above can be understood by a global audience without some acquaintance with classic braziliana
local legend rules that brazil is not for beginners
indeed this is an astonishingly complex society which essentially descended from a garden of eden before the portuguese discovered it in 1500 to slavery which still permeates all social relations to a crucial event in 1808 the arrival of dom john vi of portugal and emperor of brazil for life fleeing napoleon 's invasion and carrying with him 20,000 people who masterminded the modern brazilian state
modern is an euphemism history shows the descendants of these 20,000 actually have been raping the country blind for the past 208 years
and few have ever been held accountable
traditional brazilian elites compose one of the most noxious arrogant ignorant prejudiced mixes on the planet
justice and police enforcement are only used as a weapon when the polls do not favor their agenda
brazilian mainstream media owners are an intrinsic part of these elites
much like the us concentration model only four families control the media landscape foremost among them the marinho family 's globo media empire
i have experienced from the inside in detail how they operate
brazil is corrupt to the core from the comprador elites down to a great deal of the crass new elites which include the pt
the greed and incompetence displayed by an array of pt stalwarts is appalling a reflection of the lack of quality cadres
corruption and traffic of influence involving petrobras construction companies and politicians is undeniable even if it pales compared to goldman sachs shenanigans or big oil and/or koch brothers sheldon adelson style buying bribing of us politicians
if this was a no holds barred crusade against corruption which the car wash prosecutors insist it is the right wing opposition vassals of the old elites should have been equally exposed in mainstream media
but then the elite controlled media would simply ignore the prosecutors
and there would be nothing remotely on the scale of the hollywood blitz with lula pictured as a lowly delinquent humiliated in front of the whole planet
car wash prosecutors are right perception is reality
but what if it backfires
no consumption no investment no credit brazil could n't be in a gloomier situation
gdp was down 3.8 last year probably will be down 3.5 this year
the industrial sector was down 6.2 last year and the mining sector down 6.6 in the last quarter
the nation is on the way to its worst recession since 1901
there was no plan b by the incompetent rousseff administration for the chinese slowdown in buying brazil 's mineral agricultural wealth and the overall global slump in commodity prices
the central bank still keeps its benchmark interest rate at a whopping 14.25
a disastrous rousseff neoliberal fiscal adjustment actually increased the economic crisis
today rousseff governs that 's a figure of speech for the banking cartel and the rentiers of brazilian public debt
over $ 120 billion of the government 's budget evaporates to pay interest on the public debt
inflation is up now in double digit territory
unemployment is at 7.6 still not bad as many a player across the eu but rising
the usual suspects of course are gloating spinning non stop how brazil has become toxic for global investors
yes it 's bleak
there 's no consumption
no investment
no credit
the only way out would be to unlock the political crisis
maggots in the opposition racket though have a one track obsession the impeachment of president rousseff
shades of good ol' regime change for these wall street empire of chaos vassals an economic crisis fueled by a political crisis must by all means bring down the elected government of a key brics player
and then suddenly out of left field surges lula
the move against him by the car wash investigation may yet backfire badly
he 's already on campaign mode for 2018 although he 's not an official candidate yet
never underestimate a political animal of his stature
brazil is not on the ropes
if reelected and assuming he could purge the pt from a legion of crooks lula could push for a new dynamic
before the crisis brazilian capital was going global via petrobras embraer the bndes the bank model that inspired the brics bank the construction companies
at the same time there might be benefits in breaking at least partially this oligarchic cartel that control all infrastructure construction in brazil think of chinese companies building the high speed rail dams and ports the country badly lacks
judge moro himself has theorized that corruption festers because the brazilian economy is too closed to the outside world as india 's was until recently
but there 's a stark difference between opening up some sectors of the brazilian economy and let foreign interests tied to the comprador elites plunder the nation 's wealth
so once again we must go back to the recurrent theme in all major global conflicts
it 's the oil stupid for the empire of chaos brazil has been a major headache since lula was first elected in 2002 for an appraisal of complex us brazil relations check the indispensable work of moniz bandeira
a top priority of the empire of chaos is to prevent the emergence of regional powers fueled by abundant natural resources from oil to strategic minerals
brazil amply fits the bill
washington of course feels entitled to defend these resources
thus the need to quash not only regional integration associations such as mercosur and unasur but most of all the global reach of the brics
petrobras used to be a very efficient state company that then doubled as the single operator of the largest oil reserves discovered in the 21st century so far the pre salt deposits
before it became the target of a massive speculative judicial and media attack petrobras used to account for 10 of investment and 18 of brazilian gdp
petrobras found the pre salt deposits based on its own research and technological innovation applied to exploring oil in deep waters with no foreign input whatsoever
the beauty is there 's no risk if you drill in this pre salt layer you 're bound to find oil
no company on the planet would hand this over to the competition
and yet a notorious right wing opposition maggot promised chevron in 2014 to hand over the exploitation of pre salt mostly to big oil
the right wing opposition is busy altering the juridical regime of pre salt it 's already been approved in the senate
and rousseff is meekly going for it
couple it to the fact that rousseff 's government did absolutely nothing to buy back petrobras stock whose vertiginous fall was deftly engineered by the usual suspects
the meticulous dismantling of petrobras big oil eventually profiting from the pre salt deposits keeping in check brazil 's global power projection all this plays beautifully to the interests of the empire of chaos
geopolitically this goes way beyond the hollywood blitz and the car wash investigation
it 's no coincidence that three major brics nations are simultaneously under attack on myriad levels russia china and brazil
the concerted strategy by the masters of the universe who dictate the rules in the wall street beltway axis is to undermine by all means the brics 's collective effort to produce a viable alternative to the global economic financial system which for the moment is subjected to casino capitalism
it 's unlikely lula by himself will be able to stop them
