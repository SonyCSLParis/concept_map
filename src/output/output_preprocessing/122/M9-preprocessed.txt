don luis caroz the spanish ambassador reported on 28 may 1510 that one of the young married sisters of the duke of buckingham had attracted the attention of king henry viii
buckingham had two sisters anne wife of sir george hastings later earl of huntingdon and elizabeth wife of robert ratcliffe lord fitz walter were both ladies in waiting to queen catalina
according to the ambassador sir william compton a favoured companion of henry had been seen courting anne lady hastings
perhaps because compton was no fit paramour for a duke 's sister it was thought that he was acting on henry 's behalf
caroz reported with some glee the dramatic scenes that ensued when another sister elizabeth lady ratcliffe informed the duke of compton 's behaviour
buckingham quarrelled with compton and the king before storming from the court
anne was carried off by her husband to the safety of a nunnery
henry was clearly angry but none of this makes it clear whether compton or the king was in fact the guilty party
sir william compton 's attraction to anne stafford was the genuine article
in 1527 wolsey drew up a citation accusing compton of adultery with anne
compton apparently took the sacrament in order to disprove his guilt
however his will belies his protestations of innocence
not only did he founded a chantry where prayers were said daily for her soul and those of his family members but also the profits from certain of his lands in leicestershire were earmarked for her use for the remainder of her life
in 1514 the dilapidated bruce castle and manorial rights were given to sir william compton
he may have built a tudor house on the site
the round tower was built at about the same time from red bricks obtained locally
the walls are three feet thick and some of the original tudor bricks remain
the latest theories are that the original purpose of the round tower was a hawk mews used for keeping birds of prey for the medieval sport of falconry
there are records that henry viii had a meeting with his sister margaret queen of scotland at bruce castle in 1516
sir william compton arranged that his daughter should marry john st. leger
the bride was to bring a dowry of £ 2,346 and both families were to settle lands on the couple
the marriage did not take place seemingly because catherine compton died
sir william compton as groom of the stole the gentleman in charge of the king ’s personal toilet and privy purse was a constant thorn in wolsey ’s flesh as head of the mignons
the latter were able to win minor victories like the battle in 1517 for the hand of margaret dymoke the widow of sir richard vernon of haddon hall
wolsey wanted her for his follower sir william tyrwhitt whilst shrewsbury carew and compton combined to secure her for william coffin
in 1523 compton was sent on service to scotland
in the course of the summer of 1528 several of the court were taken ill of the sweating sickness
on of those carried off by the epidemic was sir william compton who held the constableship of warwick castle and other important offices in that part of the country
on the death of sir william compton george throckmorton of coughton sought to become sheriff and custos rotulorum of worcestershire steward of the see of worcester and under treasurer of england
compton lived at wooburn manor and left it to his son peter a ward of cardinal wolsey
his grandson henry inherited estates and started castle ashley
