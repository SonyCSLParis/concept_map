bruce castle museuma 16th century manor house set in 20 acres of parkland
the manor is operated by haringey council as a local history museum offering exhibits on social history local landscape and works by local artists
historythe castle name refers to the bruce family who owned large parts of the manor of tottenham from at least the 13th century
when robert bruce became king of scotland in 1306 he lost the family estates in england including the tottenham manor holdings
sometime in the 15th century a round tower of red brick was built forming the oldest part of the house
the tower is 21 feet high and and extends deep under ground
sometime in the 16th century historians differ as to exactly when a new house of brick was built possibly by william compton groom of the stool to henry viii
the earliest written record comes from 1516 when the king met with his sister margaret tudor queen of the scots at maister compton 's house
the house at this time was named lordship house
the combination of house and tower are thought to be one of the earliest uses of brick for an english house
the house passed to the 3rd earl of dorset who fell into debt through his habit of extravagant gambling
he leased the house to thomas peniston whose wife martha was said to be the earl 's mistress
the house was eventually sold to hugh hare 1st baron coleraine
in 1667 sir hugh died after choking on a turkey bone and the house passed to his son henry
henry hare 2nd baron coleraine renamed lordship house as bruce castle in honour of the ancient connection of the tottenham estate with the bruces of scotland
in 1684 hare remodelled the house presumably with money obtained through his marriage with the dowager duchess of somerset leaving us with the striking belvedere and elegant south facade we see today
the resident ghost the castle is said to be haunted by the ghost of hare 's first wife constantia who is said to have committed suicide when she learned that her husband was having an affair with the duchess
unfortunately for those who favour a good ghost story the first mention of a spectral presence at the castle comes in 1858 200 years after constantia 's death
the 3rd baron added a north range and james townsend lord mayor of london in 1772 remodelled the entrance front in typical georgian style
james townsend 's wife henrietta was a prodigious painter and the museum has displays of her engravings of 18th century tottemnham scenes
the west wing was torn down in the early 19th century leaving an oddly unbalanced look to the layout
the final changes came in 1870 when a three storey extension was added in gothic revival style
the hill school by that time the castle was in use as a school launched by sir rowland hill an active social and educational reformer but a man best known for postal reform
hill was headmaster of bruce castle school based on the radical for the time idea that a teacher 's role was no to impart facts and figure for students to memorise but to foster a desire to learn
when hill was appointed to head up the new general post office he left bruce castle school in the hands of his brother arthur
the museum the school closed in 1891 and tottenham council bought the estate
in 1892 the grounds were opened as the first public park in tottenham
the house was opened as a museum 1906
the museum now covers the entire london borough of haringey with a history of the area archives exhibits on the history of the post office and the life of rowland hill and collections of early photos of the area
and of course since this is tottenham there is a section on the history of the tottenham hotspur football club
the social history of the area is brought to life and there is a large collections of artwork depicting tottenham through time
