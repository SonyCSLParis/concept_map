bruce castle park and tottenham cemetery
at this point in my walk i met a very helpful harringey council official checking how many litter bins they ’d lost and after asking the way i walked under the railway to bruce castle park
sadly the museum does n’t open until one
and i was too early
as sir rowland hill once owned the house the museum also features a history of the royal mail
i will return to see if there is anything my father printed
it does have the archive of wood green empire and my father certainly did their posters and programs in his works in station road wood green
it was a very surprising area especially as you consider it was only a coiuple of hundred metres from the riots in the high street
