bruce castle 1686–1815with the exception of its neighbour all hallows church bruce castle is tottenham ’s oldest surviving building and its second most famous after white hart lane stadium
how it came by its name is a somewhat convoluted story
at the time of the norman conquest the manor of tottenham belonged to waltheof earl of huntingdon one of the few saxon magnates to retain his lands
he married the conqueror ’s niece judith and their daughter maud married david king of scotland who acquired the earldom of huntingdon waltheof having been executed for treason in 1075
eventually the manor passed to the bruis or bruce family who built the original manor house on this site in 1254
the family ’s english lands were sequestered by edward i in 1306 after robert the bruce ’s rebellion
the present house dates from the early sixteenth century it was acquired by sir william compton in 1514 and comprehensively rebuilt in 1516 henry viii met his sister margaret of scotland here and elizabeth i stayed here in 1578 as a guest of sir william ’s grandson henry
up until the latter part of the seventeenth century the house was known as the lordship
it is shown thus on a map of 1619 at which time it was the home of sir thomas penniston
this title appears to have been insufficiently grandiose for a later owner henry hare 2nd baron later lord
coleraine 1636–1708 who renamed it having presumably had a root through ancient documents in order to find something suitable
bruce castle has never had any military function
the purpose of the curious tower to the left has been a matter of speculation for many years but recent research has discovered that it was built to house falcons
in the 19th century the house became a school run by the brother of rowland hill famed for the introduction of the penny post
it was widely renowned and applauded for its progressive teaching methods no corporal punishment for instance
after the hills gave it up it continued as a school until the early 20th century for some reason having a particular attraction for pupils from latin america
it is now a museum with permanent exhibitions devoted to haringey in times past and to rowland hill
this drawing dated 1686 represents bruce castle as it was in the late seventeenth century a typical large manor house in the tudor jacobean style
elizabeth i would have recognised it
the figure in the driveway is probably lord coleraine himself
he may have been responsible for the wall built presumably to keep the unwashed at a distance it is possible that at one time the house was moated and certainly for the tower over the front entrance
from its observation platform he could be lord of all he surveyed
and although the house stands at an apparently insignificant elevation the view from the platform is astonishing
at some time in the eighteenth century bruce castle was extensively remodelled to bring it into line with the classical tastes of georgian england
the windows have been narrowed the gables are gone as are the mock crenellations on the projecting wings whilst the façade has been raised to the level of the old gable peaks and treated apparently to a coat of stucco
the little turret on the tower has gone and the wall in front of the house has been demolished and replaced by iron railings which allowed the plebs to see their betters home and marvel at it whilst still keeping them at a respectful distance
its continuation just out of picture to the right survives to this day
this view was drawn about 1770 when the house was owned by alderman townsend one assumes that is him giving a guided tour to a lady visitor or is he discussing the next round of home improvements with mrs. townsend 
bruce castle from the south east drawn in the 1790s as far as i can judge from what is now broadwater road
as it was in 1793
the stucco of alderman townsend ’s day has been removed and all in all the house looks pretty much as it does today
the artist has however greatly exaggerated the distance from the gates to the house to give the impression of a grand carriage drive that never existed
a decidedly eerie romantic gothic view drawn 1815
is it sunlight or moonlight
all it needs is a few bats flapping about
