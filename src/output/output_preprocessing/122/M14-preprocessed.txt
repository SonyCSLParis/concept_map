bruce castle a brief history bruce castle is a 16th century manor house in tottenham
originally known as lordship house there has been such a building on or near this site since the early medieval period although we do not know what it looked like
we know that in 1254 part of the land belonged to the de bruce family of scotland
when robert the bruce became king of scotland the land he owned in england was taken back by the english crown

by 1514 the site was owned by william compton
he was a close friend of henry viii in fact his position in the king ’s court was groom of the bed chamber
compton probably owned a simple courtyard house here
some of the bricks may survive in the present building
the round tower was built at this time constructed of narrow red bricks made from local clay
in the surviving building the main fabric is made up of original tudor bricks
the tower ’s walls are three feet thick
nearby at the original tottenham parish church of all hallows the tudor porch has similar moulded or castellated brick ornament
the original purpose of the round tower is unknown
current belief is that it may have been used for falconry as a hawks mews a place to rear young birds for hunting
in 1705 the 2nd lord coleraine was writing about the history of tottenham
even he knew nothing about the tower saying in respect of its great antiquity more than conveniency i keep the old brick tower in good repair although i am not able to discover the founder thereof
in 1516 henry viii borrowed the manor house to meet his sister margaret queen of scotland
there was another royal visit in 1593 when queen elizabeth i came to see william compton ’s grandson
at the end of the 1500s bruce castle was used as a refuge from the plague
by 1626 the house and land was owned by hugh hare 1st lord coleraine
hugh hare died a sudden and painful death in 1667 by choking on a turkey bone
being at supper one night and talking merrily with some gentlemen of his acquaintance and having a turkey bone in his mouth it was hard hap through extreme laughter to cause it to go down the wrong way which was ye the instrument of his death
henry hare second lord coleraine constantia lucy lady coleraine sarah dowager duchess of somerset henry hare 2nd lord coleraine inherited the house and moved in with his young wife constantia lucy
great mystery surrounds constantia ’s life and death
the story goes that henry grew tired of his wife and banished her to the top of the house
as their relationship worsened he locked her in the small room under the clock
it is said that one night constantia was so unhappy she jumped off the balcony killing herself and her child
there is no record of her burial in all hallow church ’s parish registers although they completely cover this period
it is said that lady constantia has become the ghost of bruce castle and can be seen at the window at night in november
the first written reference to the ghost was in the edmonton advertiser in march 1858
henry hare was responsible for a radical remodelling of the house between 1682 and 1684
this included the raising of the turret projections and the building of the clock tower above the porch
it seems that much of this work was prompted by henry ’s second marriage to the duchess of somerset who was very rich and powerful
henry was a keen historian and it is believed that he gave the building the name bruce castle
the next owner of the house was henry ’s grandson another henry who added more rooms and the coat of arms which remains on the north face of bruce castle
he stayed here on and off between his tours around europe
he had a daughter called henrietta rose but because she was illegitimate and french she could not inherit her father ’s estate
after petitioning parliament an act was passed giving the estate to her husband james townsend
james was an mp and also became lord mayor of london
he made many changes to the building this included the parapet in front of the tudor gables on the second floor giving the building a fashionable georgian look and changing the entrance to the east wing
these changes cost a huge amount of money and eventually bruce castle was auctioned off
the building was then bought by john eardley wilmot
he became famous for helping american refugees who fled to england after the american war of independence
he also became involved with the french refugees who were fleeing the french revolution
after wilmot ’s death bruce castle was purchased by john ede and then in 1827 by the hill family
sir rowland hill the hill family opened a private boarding school for boys
they built the victorian wing on the west side of the building extending into the park to house the school
rowland hill was joint headmaster with his brother arthur
they did not approve of corporal punishment and never hit the boys when they behaved badly which was very unusual at the time
it was a very popular school and boys came from around the world to bruce castle school
charles dickens visited the school several times as did charles babbage the originator of the digital computer
rowland hill left teaching and went on to work for the post office
he is famous for his postal reform work that included inventing the penny black postage stamp and the penny post system
the school closed in 1891
joshua pedley who bought bruce castle then sold it on to tottenham urban district council
in 1892 the grounds were opened as the first public park and the building became tottenham ’s first public museum in 1906
during world war ii the museum was used as a clinic and for exhibitions about the war effort
there has also been a dentist at bruce castle
bruce castle is now a grade 1 listed building and houses the london borough of haringey ’s archive and local history museum
