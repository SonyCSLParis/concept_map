alien and sedition acts text of the aliens act text of the sedition act the alien and sedition acts were four bills passed by the federalist dominated 5th united states congress and signed into law by president john adams in 1798
1 they made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen naturalization act allowed the president to imprison and deport non citizens who were deemed dangerous alien friends act or who were from a hostile nation alien enemies act and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government sedition act
the federalists argued that they strengthened national security during an undeclared naval war with france
critics argued that they were primarily an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the federalist party and violated the right of freedom of speech in the first amendment
2 three of the acts were repealed after the democratic republican party of thomas jefferson came to power
but the alien enemies act remained in effect was revised and codified in 1918 for use in world war i and was used by president franklin delano roosevelt to imprison japanese german and italian aliens during world war ii
following cessation of hostilities the act was used by president harry s. truman to continue to imprison then deport aliens of the formerly hostile nations
in 1948 the supreme court determined that presidential powers under the acts continued after cessation of hostilities until there was a peace treaty with the hostile nation
the revised alien enemies act remains in effect today
the naturalization act increased the residency requirement for american citizenship from five to fourteen years
at the time the majority of immigrants supported thomas jefferson and the democratic republicans the political opponents of the federalists
3 the alien friends act allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered dangerous to the peace and safety of the united states at any time while the alien enemies act authorized the president to do the same to any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of fourteen during times of war
lastly the controversial sedition act restricted speech which was critical of the federal government
under the sedition act the federalists allowed people who were accused of violating the sedition laws to use truth as a defense
4 the sedition act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government
5]the acts were denounced by democratic republicans and ultimately helped them to victory in the 1800 election when thomas jefferson defeated the incumbent president adams
the sedition act and the alien friends act were allowed to expire in 1800 and 1801 respectively
the alien enemies act however remains in effect as 50 usc sections 21â€“24
6]historythe opposition to the federalists spurred on by democratic republicans reached new heights at this time with the democratic republicans supporting france still in the midst of the french revolution
some appeared to desire an event similar to the french revolution to come to the united states to overthrow the government
7 when democratic republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws such as the 1791 whiskey tax the first tax levied by the national government and threatened to rebel federalists threatened to send in the army to force them to capitulate
8 as the unrest sweeping europe was bleeding over into the united states calls for secession reached unparalleled heights and the fledgling nation seemed ready to tear itself apart
8 some of this was seen by federalists as having been caused by french and french sympathizing immigrants
8 the alien act and the sedition act were meant to guard against this perceived threat of anarchy
they were a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800
they were controversial then and remain so today
opposition to them resulted in the highly controversial virginia and kentucky resolutions authored by james madison and thomas jefferson
prominent prosecutions under the sedition act include james thomson callender a scottish citizen had been expelled from great britain for his political writings
living first in philadelphia then seeking refuge close in virginia he wrote a book entitled the prospect before us read and approved by vice president jefferson before publication in which he called the adams administration a continual tempest of malignant passions and the president a repulsive pedant a gross hypocrite and an unprincipled oppressor
callender already residing in virginia and writing for the richmond examiner was indicted in mid-1800 under the sedition act and convicted fined $ 200 and sentenced to nine months in jail
9]matthew lyon was a democratic republican congressman from vermont
the congressman was the first individual that was placed on trial under the alien and sedition acts
1 he was indicted in 1800 under the sedition act for an essay he had written in the vermont journal accusing the administration of ridiculous pomp foolish adulation and selfish avarice
while awaiting trial lyon commenced publication of lyon 's republican magazine subtitled the scourge of aristocracy
at trial he was fined $ 1,000 and sentenced to four months in jail
after his release he returned to congress
10][11]benjamin franklin bache was editor of the aurora a democratic republican newspaper
bache had accused george washington of incompetence and financial irregularities and the blind bald crippled toothless querulous adams of nepotism and monarchical ambition
he was arrested in 1798 under the sedition act but he died of yellow fever before trial
12]anthony haswell was an english immigrant and a printer in vermont
13 among other activities haswell reprinted parts of the aurora including bache 's claim that the federal government had employed tories
14 haswell was found guilty of seditious libel by judge william paterson and sentenced to a two month imprisonment and a $ 200 fine
15]luther baldwin was indicted convicted and fined $ 100 for an incident that occurred during a visit by president adams to newark new jersey
16][17]in november 1798 david brown led a group in dedham massachusetts including benjamin fairbanks in setting up a liberty pole with the words no stamp act no sedition act no alien bills no land tax downfall to the tyrants of america peace and retirement to the president long live the vice president
18][19][20 brown was arrested in andover massachusetts but because he could not afford the $ 4,000 bail he was taken to salem for trial
21 brown was tried in june 1799
18 brown pleaded guilty but justice samuel chase asked him to name others who had assisted him
18 brown refused was fined $ 480,[21][22 and sentenced to eighteen months in prison the most severe sentence ever imposed under the sedition act
18][21]19th century the democratic republicans made the alien and sedition acts an important issue in the 1800 election
thomas jefferson upon assuming the presidency pardoned those still serving sentences under the sedition act,[23 and their fines were soon repaid
24 it has been said that the alien acts were aimed at albert gallatin and the sedition act aimed at benjamin bache 's aurora
25][26 while government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation many aliens fled the country during the debate over the alien and sedition acts and adams never signed a deportation order
27]the alien and sedition acts were never appealed to the supreme court whose right of judicial review was not established until marbury v. madison in 1803
subsequent mentions in supreme court opinions beginning in the mid-20th century have assumed that the sedition act would today be found unconstitutional
28][29]thomas jefferson and james madison also secretly drafted the kentucky and virginia resolutions denouncing the federal legislation though many other state legislatures strongly opposed these resolutions
30][31][32 though the resolutions followed madison 's interposition approach jefferson advocated nullification and at one point drafted a threat for kentucky to secede
33 jefferson 's biographer dumas malone argued that this might have gotten jefferson impeached for treason had his actions become known at the time
34 in writing the kentucky resolutions jefferson warned that unless arrested at the threshold the alien and sedition acts would necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood
 historian ron chernow says of this he was n't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience he was calling for outright rebellion if needed against the federal government of which he was vice president
 jefferson thus set forth a radical doctrine of states rights that effectively undermined the constitution
 35 chernow argues that neither jefferson nor madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the alien and sedition acts themselves
35 historian garry wills argued their nullification effort if others had picked it up would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided alien and sedition laws which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure"[36
the theoretical damage of the kentucky and virginia resolutions was deep and lasting and was a recipe for disunion
35 george washington was so appalled by them that he told patrick henry that if systematically and pertinaciously pursued they would dissolve the union or produce coercion
35 the influence of jefferson 's doctrine of states rights reverberated right up to the civil war and beyond
8 future president james garfield at the close of the civil war said that jefferson 's kentucky resolution contained the germ of nullification and secession and we are today reaping the fruits
8]20th and 21st centuries the alien enemies acts remained in effect at the outset of world war i.[37
it was recodified to be part of the us war and national defense statutes 50 usc 21 24

in another inter american conference in mexico city on march 8 1945 north and south american governments resolved to recommended adoption of measures to prevent aliens of hostile nations who were deemed to be security threats or threats to welfare from remaining in north or south america
truman gave authority to the secretary of state to determine if alien enemies in the united states who were sent to the united states from latin america or who were in the united states illegally endangered the welfare or security

ludecke continued to be held after cessation of hostilities
in 1947 ludecke petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to order his release after the attorney general ordered him deported
the court ruled 5 4 to release ludecke but also found that the alien enemies act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased until an actual treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government
in 2015 presidential candidate donald trump made a proposal to ban all muslims from entering the united states as part of the war on terror);[40][41][42
roosevelt 's application of the alien enemies act was cited as a possible justification
the proposal created international controversy drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in united states presidential elections
43][44][45][46
a former reagan administration aide noted that despite criticism of trump 's proposal to invoke the law the alien enemies act is still on the books and people in congress for many decades have nâ€™t repealed the law nor has barack obama
47 other critics claimed that that the proposal violated founding principles unconstitutional for singling out a religion and not a hostile nation
this included the pentagon and others who made the criticism that the proposal and its citation of the alien enemies proclamations as authority played into the isis narrative that the united states was at war with the entire muslim religion not just with isis and other terrorist entities
