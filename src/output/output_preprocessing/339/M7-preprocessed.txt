james madison rebukes nullification deniers by publius huldah
this is the age of ignorance
our intellectuals ca n’t think
our scholars parrot each other
the self educated fixate on idiotic theories
our people despise truth and disseminate lies
nullification deniers such as matthew spalding of heritage foundation jarrett stepman of human events law professor randy barnett david barton of wallbuilders and history professor allen c. guelzo say that nullification by states of unconstitutional acts of the federal government is unlawful and impossible
they make the demonstrably false assertions that
states do n’t have the right to nullify unconstitutional acts of the federal government because our constitution does n’t say they can do it
nullification is literally impossible
the supreme court is the final authority on what is constitutional and what is not and the states and the people must submit to whatever the supreme court says and james madison father of our constitution opposed nullification
their assertions contradict our declaration of independence the federalist papers our federal constitution and what james madison thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton really said
what are the two conditions precedent for nullification
the deniers seem unaware of the two conditions our framers saw must be present before nullification is proper and possible
these conditions are important you will see why
the act of the federal government must be unconstitutional usually a usurpation of a power not delegated to the federal government in the constitution and
the act must be something the states or the people can nullify”- i.e. refuse to obey the act must order them to do something or not do something or otherwise thwart impede or hinder
what is interposition and what is nullification
a state interposes when it stands between the federal government and the citizens of the state in order to protect them from the federal government
interposition takes various forms depending on the circumstances
hamilton refers to interposition in federalist no 33 5th para):“if the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers the people whose creature it is must appeal to the standard the constitution they have formed and take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution as the exigency may suggest and prudence justify
emphasis mine]“nullification is merely one form of interposition
here are three highly relevant illustrations
when the act of the federal government is unconstitutional and orders the states or the people to do or not do something nullification by direct disobedience is the proper form of interposition
when the act of the federal government is unconstitutional but does n’t order the states or the people to do or not do something the alien sedition acts the states may take various measures to thwart impede or hinder implementation of the federal act in order to protect the member states the people and the constitution from federal tyranny
see the virginia and kentucky resolutions of 1798
when the act of the federal government is constitutional but unjust the tariff act of 1828 the states may not nullify it but may interpose by objecting and trying to get the tariff act changed
our founding principles in a nutshell in order to understand the right of nullification one must also learn the founding principles set forth in the declaration of independence 2nd para
then one can see that when powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act 1 is the natural right which all admit to be a remedy against insupportable oppression
2 these principles are:1
rights come from god;2
people create governments;3
the purpose of government is to secure the rights god gave us and4
when a government we created seeks to take away our god given rights we have the right we have the duty to alter abolish or throw off such government
let us look briefly at these principles:1
our declaration of independence 2nd para recognizes that god is the grantor of rights
so rights do n’t come from the constitution the supreme court or the federal government
2
the preamble to our constitution shows that we the people created the federal government
it is our creature
alexander hamilton says this in federalist paper no 33 5th para and thomas jefferson in his draft of the kentucky resolutions of 1798 8th resolution
as our creature it may lawfully do only what we authorized it to do in our constitution
we created a federal government an alliance of sovereign states 3 associated in a federation with a national government to which is delegated supremacy over the states in few and defined areas only
james madison says in federalist no 45 9th para):“the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined
those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite
the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected
the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state
boldface mine]do you see
we delegated only few and defined powers to the federal government
these are the enumerated powers listed in the constitution
4these enumerated powers concern military defense international commerce relations control of immigration and naturalization of new citizens creation of a uniform commercial system weights measures patents copyrights money based on gold silver bankruptcy laws mail delivery some road building and with some of the amendments protect certain civil rights
it is only with respect to the enumerated powers that the federal government has lawful authority over the country at large
all other powers are reserved to the several states and the people
3 our constitution authorizes the federal government to secure our god given rights in the following ways 5it is to secure our rights to life and liberty by military defense art i sec 8 cl 11 16
laws against piracy and other felonies committed on the high seas
art i sec 8 cl 10 protecting us from invasion art iv sec 4 prosecuting traitors art iii sec 3 and restrictive immigration policies art i sec 9 cl 1
it is to secure our property rights by
regulating trade commerce so we can produce sell prosper art
i sec 8 cl.3
the original intent of the interstate commerce clause is to prohibit states from levying tolls taxes on articles of commerce as they are transported thru the states for buying selling
establishing uniform weights measures and a money system based on gold silver art i sec 8 cl 5 inflation via paper currency fractional reserve lending is theft
punishing counterfeiters art i sec 8 cl 6
making bankruptcy laws to permit the orderly dissolution or reorganization of debtors estates with fair treatment of creditors art i sec 8 cl 4 and
issuing patents copyrights to protect ownership of intellectual labors art i sec 8 cl 8)
it is to secure our right to liberty by
laws against slavery 13th amendment providing fair trials in federal courts 4th 5th 6th 7th and 8th amendments and obeying the constitution
this is how our federal constitution implements the founding principle that the purpose of government is to secure the rights god gave us 4
the fourth founding principle in our declaration is this when government takes away our god given rights we have the right the duty to alter abolish or throw off such government
nullification is thus a natural right of self defense thomas jefferson said but where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact casus non foederis to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they would be under the dominion absolute and unlimited of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them 6
boldface mine]james madison commented on the above the right of nullification meant by mr. jefferson is the natural right which all admit to be a remedy against insupportable oppression 7alexander hamilton says in federalist no 28 5th para from end):“if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success
boldface mine]hamilton then shows how the states can rein in a usurping federal government:“ the state governments will in all possible contingencies afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority ”do you see
but the nullification deniers do not see because in addition to their apparent unfamiliarity with the original source writings on nullification as well as the federalist papers they reject or do not understand the founding principle that rights pre date pre exist the constitution and come from god
nullification is not a paltry constitutional right
it has a hallowed status it is that natural right of self defense which pre dates pre exists the constitution
now let us look at the false assertions made by the nullification deniers
false assertion 1 that states ca n’t nullify unconstitutional acts of the federal government because the constitution does n’t say they can do it
as we have just seen jefferson madison and hamilton saw nullification of unconstitutional acts of the federal government as a natural right not a constitutional right
and since rights come from god there is no such thing as a constitutional right
the right of nullification transcending as it does the constitution and being nowhere prohibited by the constitution to the states is a reserved power
the 10th amendment says:“the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
nothing in the federal constitution prohibits the states from nullifying unconstitutional acts of the federal government
thus nullification is a reserved power of the states the people
we saw where madison says in federalist no 45 that the powers delegated to the federal government are few and defined and all other powers are reserved to the several states
thus it is the federal government which is supposed to look to the constitution for the list of enumerated powers
we the people delegated to it
the states do n’t go to the constitution to look for permission because they retain all powers they did n’t exclusively 8 delegate to the federal government or prohibit by art
i sec 10
the nullification deniers have it backwards they permit the federal government to ignore the enumerated powers limitations set forth in the constitution but insist the states ca n’t do anything unless the constitution specifically says they can
do you see how they pervert our constitution
false assertion 2 that nullification is literally impossible
we saw above the two conditions which must exist before nullification is proper and possible
the act of the federal government must be unconstitutional and
the act must be something the people or the states can refuse to obey or otherwise thwart impede or obstruct
here are examples of unconstitutional federal acts the states can and should nullify the constitution does not delegate to the federal government power to ban christianity from the public square
but in 1962 the supreme court first ordered the states to stop prayers in the public schools
that court next banned the ten commandments from the public schools
since those orders were usurpations of powers not lawfully possessed by the court the states should have nullified them by directing their schools to ignore them
if congress by law or the president by executive order orders the people to turn in our guns we must refuse to comply
the constitution does n’t authorize the federal government to disarm us
so the states and the people must nullify such law or order by refusing to obey
here are examples of unconstitutional unjust state and municipal laws rosa parks and martin luther king nullified the jim crow laws required black people to sit at the back of the bus and prohibited them from eating in public places and using public restrooms water fountains park benches etc using non violent civil disobedience rosa parks and mlk led black people to refuse to obey these unjust and unconstitutional sec 1 14th amdt laws
this was nullification by brave citizens
now i ’ll show you unconstitutional acts which could n’t be directly disobeyed because they were n’t directed to anything the states or the people could refuse to obey in 1798 thomas jefferson wrote the kentucky resolutions and james madison wrote the virginia resolutions
these resolutions objected to laws made by congress which purported to grant to the president dictatorial powers over aliens and seditious words
kentucky and virginia could object but they could n’t prevent the president from enforcing the alien sedition acts because the president had the raw power to send out thugs to arrest aliens or people who had spoken or written seditious words and then to persecute them
so jefferson and madison showed why the alien sedition acts were unconstitutional protested them and asked other states to join the protest and take whatever measures needed to be taken to protect the states the people and the constitution
now
note
well randy barnett law professor and other deniers crow that the virginia and kentucky resolutions prove there is no literal power of nullification in the states
but barnett should know better because he is a lawyer
every litigation attorney knows this at a motion hearing before the judge opposing counsel whips out a court opinion which he cites as authority for a legal point
he gives the judge a highlighted copy and gives you opposing counsel an un highlighted copy
while he is making his argument to the judge you must listen to what he is saying and at the same time read the opinion and develop an argument which distinguishes the opinion opposing counsel is using from the case at bar
when opposing counsel finishes the judge looks at you and says and how do you respond you must be ready with your argument right then
are we to believe that randy barnett law professor sitting in his ivory tower and under no pressure is unable to distinguish between situations where a state does have a literal power to nullify by direct disobedience an unconstitutional act of the federal government
when it orders the state or the people to do -or not do something and when the state does not have a literal power to directly disobey the act
because as with the alien sedition acts it does not dictate something the states or the people can refuse to obey and so they can only thwart impede obstruct the unconstitutional act
false assertion 3 that the supreme court is the final authority on what is constitutional and what is not and the states and the people must submit to whatever the supreme court says
the federal government has become a tyranny which acts without constitutional authority
this came about because we were lured away from the founding principle that the purpose of government is to secure the rights god gave us and were seduced into believing government should provide for our needs and protect us from the challenges of life
progressives of the early 1900s 9 transformed the federal government into the frankensteinian monster it is today
they imposed the regulatory welfare state where the federal government regulates business and commerce natural resources human resources and benefits some people e.g. welfare parasites labor unions obama donors at the expense of others
the progressives claimed the power to determine what is in the public interest and have the federal government implement their notions of what advances the public interest
under the progressives the federal government was no longer limited by the enumerated powers delegated in the constitution but would follow the will of the people as expressed by their representatives in the federal government
in other words the progressives gave the federal government a blank check to fill out anyway they want
people in the federal government now claim power to do whatever they want to us
the federal government imposed by the progressives is evil
in order to provide benefits to some the federal government violates the god given property rights of others
the federal government robs peter to pay paul
in order to protect us from the challenges of life including made up problems such as global warming and lack of medical insurance the federal government violates everyone ’s god given rights to liberty
and thus today the federal government
usurps powers not delegated to it in the constitution
most of what it does is unconstitutional as outside the enumerated powers delegated in our constitution
has become an instrument of oppression injustice and immorality
 has taken away most of our god given rights and is now conniving to take away our god given right to self defense
now you know how the federal government was transformed from being the securer of our god given rights to a tyranny which oppresses some of the people for the benefit of others and takes everyone ’s liberty away except for those in the ruling class
so
what do we do
what can we do
the nullification deniers insist we must obey whatever congress and the president dictate unless five 5 judges on the supreme court say we do n’t have to
they say the supreme court is the final authority on what is constitutional and what is not
but think who created the federal government we did
it is our creature
is the creature to dictate to the creator
the nullification deniers say yes
they say that
every law made by congress the legislative branch of the federal government is supreme and
every executive order issued by the president the executive branch of the federal government is binding and
the states and the people must obey unless and until five 5 judges on the supreme court the judicial branch of the federal government say the law or executive order is unconstitutional
in other words only the federal government may question the federal government and no one may question the supreme court
under their vision the federal government we created with the constitution is the exclusive and final judge of the extent of the powers we delegated to it and the opinion of five 5 judges not the constitution is the sole measure of its powers
jarrett stepman regurgitates the statist lie that the ultimate decision maker in terms of america ’s political system is the supreme court
randy barnett law professor chants the statist refrain what has the supreme court said and meant and are there now five justices to sustain the claim
barnett selects two paragraphs from madison ’s report on the virginia resolutions 1799 1800 which address the alien sedition acts and claims they show madison expressly denies or at minimum equivocates about whether there is a literal power of nullification in states
well we saw above that states could n’t directly disobey the alien sedition acts because they purported to grant dictatorial powers to the president and did not require the states or the people to do or not do something
and the two paragraphs barnett claims are so telling as to the states lack of literal power to nullify anything and as to the ultimate authority of the judicial branch appear under madison ’s discussion of the last two resolutions the 7th 8th where virginia had asked other states to join them in taking measures to protect the states the people and the constitution from the federal government
in his discussion of the 7th resolution madison merely responded to the objection that only federal judges may declare the meaning of the constitution of course citizens states may declare acts of the federal government unconstitutional
when they do so they are not acting as judges they are acting as citizens and as sovereign states to take those measures which need to be taken to protect themselves from unconstitutional acts of the federal government
now
note
well madison says in the same report barnett cites that it is a plain principle founded in common sense that the states are the final authority on whether the federal government has violated our constitution
under his discussion of the 3rd resolution madison says:“it appears to your committee to be a plain principle founded in common sense illustrated by common practice and essential to the nature of compacts that where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the parties the parties themselves must be the rightful judges in the last resort whether the bargain made has been pursued or violated
the constitution of the united states was formed by the sanction of the states given by each in its sovereign capacity
it adds to the stability and dignity as well as to the authority of the constitution that it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation
the states then being the parties to the constitutional compact and in their sovereign capacity it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated and consequently that as the parties to it they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition
emphasis mine]a bit further down madison explains that if when the federal government usurps power the states can not act so as to stop the usurpation and thereby preserve the constitution as well as the safety of the states there would be no relief from usurped power
this would subvert the rights of the people as well as betray the fundamental principle of our founding:“ if the deliberate exercise of dangerous power palpably withheld by the constitution could not justify the parties to it in interposing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil and thereby to preserve the constitution itself as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it there would be an end to all relief from usurped power and a direct subversion of the rights specified or recognized under all the state constitutions as well as a plain denial of the fundamental principle on which our independence itself was declared
emphasis mine]a bit further down madison answers the objection that the judicial authority is to be regarded as the sole expositor of the constitution in the last resort
madison explains that when the federal government acts outside the constitution by usurping powers and when the constitution affords no remedy to that usurpation then the sovereign states who are the parties to the constitution must likewise step outside the constitution and appeal to that original natural right of self defense
madison also says that the judicial branch is as likely to usurp as are the other two branches
thus the sovereign states as the parties to the constitution have as much right to judge the usurpations of the judicial branch as they do the legislative and executive branches:“ the judicial department also may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the constitution and consequently that the ultimate right of the parties to the constitution to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated must extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by another by the judiciary as well as by the executive or the legislature
madison goes on to say that all three branches of the federal government obtain their delegated powers from the constitution and they may not annul the authority of their creator
and if the judicial branch connives with other branches in usurping powers our constitution will be destroyed
so the judicial branch does not have final say as“ to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact from which the judicial as well as the other department hold their delegated trusts
on any other hypothesis the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it 10 and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers might subvert forever and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy the very constitution which all were instituted to preserve
shame on you nullification deniers who misrepresent what madison said or ignorantly insist that madison said the judicial branch is the final authority
false assertion 4 that james madison opposed nullification by states of unconstitutional acts of the federal government
matthew spalding heritage foundation and david barton wallbuilders cite south carolina ’s nullification crisis of 1832 as proof that james madison vehemently opposed nullification
what spalding and barton say is not true
did they read what madison wrote on s. carolina ’s doctrine of nullification are they so lacking in critical thinking skills that they ca n’t make the distinction between the nullification doctrine madison and jefferson hamilton embraced and the peculiar doctrine of nullification advanced by s. carolina we saw in madison ’s report on the virginia resolutions 1799 1800 that in a proper case interposing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil is essential to preserve the constitution itself as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it
and we saw above that the condition which must be present before nullification is proper is that the act of the federal government must be unconstitutional
now let ’s look at the tariff act of 1828 and the s. carolina nullification crisis the south was agricultural
during the 1820 ’s the southern states bought manufactured goods from england
england bought cotton produced by the southern states
however infant industries in the northeast were producing some of the same manufactured goods as england but they were more expensive than the english imports
so they could n’t compete with the cheaper imports
so
in 1828 congress imposed a high tariff on the english imports
the southern states called this the tariff of abominations because the tariff made the english goods too expensive to buy and since the southern states stopped buying english goods the english stopped buying southern cotton
the southern states had to pay more for manufactured goods they lost the major buyer of their cotton and their economy was weakened
now
note
well our constitution delegates specific authority to congress to impose tariffs on imports and the tariff must be the same in each state art i sec 8 cl 1
thus the tariff act of 1828 was constitutional 11so
can you dear reader see something which matthew spalding ph.d. and david barton are unable to see south carolina wanted to nullify a constitutional law
of course madison opposed s. carolina ’s peculiar doctrine of nullification madison and jefferson hamilton always said the act nullified must be unconstitutional
in his notes on nullification 1834 12 madison addressed s. carolina ’s peculiar doctrine
he said that in the report of a special committee of the house of representatives of south carolina in 1828 a doctrine of nullification was set forth which asserted that
a state has a constitutional right to nullify any federal law and
the nullification is presumed valid and is to remain in force unless ¾ of the states in a convention say the nullification is n’t valid
what madison opposed was the particular doctrine of nullification set forth by s. carolina and what madison actually said about the s. carolina doctrine is this
the federal government has delegated authority to impose import tariffs
the constitution requires that all import tariffs be uniform throughout the united states states ca n’t nullify tariffs which are authorized by the constitution ¼ of the states do n’t have the right to dictate to ¾ of the states on matters within the powers delegated to the federal government nullification is not a constitutional right”;and near the end of his notes madison quoted with approval thomas jefferson ’s statement:“ but where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact casus non foederis to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they would be under the dominion absolute and unlimited of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them
boldface mine]madison then says:“thus the right of nullification meant by mr. jefferson is the natural right which all admit to be a remedy against insupportable oppression
emphasis mine do you see
madison is saying that s. carolina could n’t nullify the tariff act of 1828 because the act was constitutional
nullification is a natural right”- it is not a constitutional right
rights do n’t come from the constitution
all agree that when the federal government acts outside of the constitution nullification by the states is the proper remedy
application today
when we the people ratified our constitution and thereby created the federal government we did not delegate to our creature power to control our medical care restrict guns and ammunition dictate what is done in the public schools dictate how we use our lands and all the thousands of things they do we never gave them authority in our constitution to do
accordingly each state has a natural right to nullify these unconstitutional dictates within its borders
these dictates are outside the compact the sovereign states made with each other we never gave our creature power over these objects
as jefferson and madison said without nullification the states and the people would be under the absolute and unlimited control of the federal government
and that dear reader is where these nullification deniers with their false assertions and shameful misrepresentations would put you
to sum this up
nullification is a natural right of self defense
rights do n’t come from the constitution
like all rights the right of self defense comes from god the declaration of independence 2nd para
nullification is a reserved power within the meaning of the 10th amendment
the constitution does n’t prohibit states from nullifying and we reserved the power to do it
god requires us to disobey civil authorities when they violate god ’s law
that ’s why the 2nd para of the declaration of independence says we have the duty to overthrow tyrannical government
see the biblical foundation of our constitution
nullification is required by oath of office article vi cl 3 requires all state officers and judges to support the federal constitution
therefore when the federal government violates the constitution the states must smack them down
conclusionour founders and framers were a different people than we of today
they were manly men who knew statecraft political philosophy and could think
but our experts of today have been indoctrinated with statism and ca n’t think
they lie or they just ignorantly repeat what they hear without checking it out to see if what they are repeating is true
so we need to man up throw off the indoctrination and the phony experts learn our founding documents including the federalist papers and stop repeating the lies we are told
trust no one
and repudiate cowardice as the proper response to the evil which is overtaking our land
man up people
phpost script added october 2 2013 something is rotten in the cato institute robert a. levy chairman of the cato institute recently wrote an article published in the new york times the limits of nullification where levy regurgitates the same fabrication randy barnett told to the effect that madison said in his report of 1800 that all the states can do is express their opinion that a federal law is unconstitutional
the kindest thing one can say about levy ’s article is that it is childishly ignorant

the deniers seem unaware that the states retained sovereignty in all matters not exclusively delegated to the federal government
alexander hamilton says in federalist no 32 2nd para):“an entire consolidation of the states into one complete national sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts and whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent on the general will
but as the plan of the convention the constitution aims only at a partial union or consolidation the state governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had and which were not exclusively delegated to the united states
caps are hamilton ’s boldface mine]federalist
no 62 5th para):“ the equal vote allowed to each state
each state gets two u.s. senators is a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual states and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty
in order to guard against an improper consolidation of the states into one simple republic madison or hamilton
boldface mine]see also federalist no 39 madison 6th para et seq.)in madison ’s report on the virginia resolutions 1799 1800 he several times refers in his discussion of the 3rd resolution to the states acting in their sovereign capacity when as the parties to the constitutional compact they decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated”:“ the states then being the parties to the constitutional compact and in their sovereign capacity it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated and consequently that as the parties to it they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition
boldface mine]4 contrary to the misconstructions long and unlawfully applied by the federal government the federal constitution is one of enumerated powers only
e.g.:“ the proposed government can not be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignity over all other objects federalist no 39 3rd para from end madison boldface mine]“ the general federal government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws
its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects
federalist no 14 8th para madison boldface mine]“ it merits particular attention that the laws of the confederacy congress as to the enumerated and legitimate objects of its jurisdiction will become the supreme law of the land thus the legislatures courts and magistrates of the respective members the states will be incorporated into the operations of the national government as far as its just and constitutional authority extends
caps are hamilton ’s federalist no 27 last para)5 our constitution authorizes the federal government to secure our god given rights in the ways appropriate for the national government of a federation
the states secure them in other ways

this explains the limited exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government and the areas where the federal government and the states have concurrent jurisdiction
9 teddy roosevelt ran on the progressive platform of 1912
both major parties have been dominated by progressives ever since
10 hamilton says respecting the legislative branch federalist no 78 10th para):“ every act of a delegated authority contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void
no legislative act therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid
to deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal that the servant is above his master that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize but what they forbid
emphasis mine]11 the tariff act of 1828 was constitutional but benefited the northeast at the expense of the south
it thus violated our founding principle that governments exist to secure the rights god gave us
god never gave us the right to be free of competition in business
since the tariff was constitutional but unjust the remedy was to get congress to fix it
12 madison ’s notes on nullification 1834 are long rambling
copy to word enlarge the type color code to sort out the strands of arguments
keep in mind that what madison is addressing is s. carolina ’s peculiar doctrine where they wanted to nullify a constitutional tariff ph
