james madison report on the virginia resolutions jan. 1800 elliot 4:546 -50 579 house of delegates session of 1799 -1800 report of the committee to whom were referred the communications of various state relative to the resolutions of the last general assembly of this state concerning the alien and sedition laws
whatever room might be found in the proceedings of some of the states who have disapproved of the resolutions of the general assembly of this commonwealth passed on the 21st day of december 1798 for painful remarks on the spirit and manner of those proceedings it appears to the committee most consistent with the duty as well as dignity of the general assembly to hasten an oblivion of every circumstance which might be construed into a diminution of mutual respect confidence and affection among the members of the union
the committee have deemed it a more useful task to revise with a critical eye the resolutions which have met with their disapprobation to examine fully the several objections and arguments which have appeared against them and to inquire whether there can be any errors of fact of principle or of reasoning which the candor of the general assembly ought to acknowledge and correct
the first of the resolutions is in the words following:-- resolved that the general assembly of virginia doth unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the constitution of the united states and the constitution of this state against every aggression either foreign or domestic and that they will support the government of the united states in all measures warranted by the former
 no unfavorable comment can have been made on the sentiments here expressed
to maintain and defend the constitution of the united states and of their own state against every aggression both foreign and domestic and to support the government of the united states in all measures warranted by their constitution are duties which the general assembly ought always to feel and to which on such an occasion it was evidently proper to express their sincere and firm adherence
in their next resolution-- the general assembly most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the union of the states to maintain which it pledges all its powers and that for this end it is their duty to watch over and oppose every infraction of those principles which constitute the only basis of that union because a faithful observance of them can alone secure its existence and the public happiness
 the observation just made is equally applicable to this solemn declaration of warm attachment to the union and this solemn pledge to maintain it nor can any question arise among enlightened friends of the union as to the duty of watching over and opposing every infraction of those principles which constitute its basis and a faithful observance of which can alone secure its existence and the public happiness thereon depending
the third resolution is in the words following:-- that this assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact and that in case of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact the states who are parties thereto have the right and are in duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil and for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities rights and liberties appertaining to them
 on this resolution the committee have bestowed all the attention which its importance merits
they have scanned it not merely with a strict but with a severe eye and they feel confidence in pronouncing that in its just and fair construction it is unexceptionably true in its several positions as well as constitutional and conclusive in its inferences
the resolution declares first that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties in other words that the federal powers are derived from the constitution and that the constitution is a compact to which the states are parties
clear as the position must seem that the federal powers are derived from the constitution and from that alone the committee are not unapprized of a late doctrine which opens another source of federal powers not less extensive and important than it is new and unexpected
the examination of this doctrine will be most conveniently connected with a review of a succeeding resolution
the committee satisfy themselves here with briefly remarking that in all the contemporary discussions and comments which the constitution underwent it was constantly justified and recommended on the ground that the powers not given to the government were withheld from it and that if any doubt could have existed on this subject under the original text of the constitution it is removed as far as words could remove it by the 12th amendment now a part of the constitution which expressly declares that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
 the other position involved in this branch of the resolution namely that the states are parties to the constitution or compact is in the judgment of the committee equally free from objection
it is indeed true that the term states is sometimes used in a vague sense and sometimes in different senses according to the subject to which it is applied
thus it sometimes means the separate sections of territory occupied by the political societies within each sometimes the particular governments established by those societies sometimes those societies as organized into those particular governments and lastly it means the people composing those political societies in their highest sovereign capacity
although it might be wished that the perfection of language admitted less diversity in the signification of the same words yet little inconvenience is produced by it where the true sense can be collected with certainty from the different applications
in the present instance whatever different construction of the term states in the resolution may have been entertained all will at least concur in that last mentioned because in that sense the constitution was submitted to the states in that sense the states ratified it and in that sense of the term states they are consequently parties to the compact from which the powers of the federal government result
the next position is that the general assembly views the powers of the federal government as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact and as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants therein enumerated
 it does not seem possible that any just objection can lie against either of these clauses
the first amounts merely to a declaration that the compact ought to have the interpretation plainly intended by the parties to it the other to a declaration that it ought to have the execution and effect intended by them
if the powers granted be valid it is solely because they are granted and if the granted powers are valid because granted all other powers not granted must not be valid
the resolution having taken this view of the federal compact proceeds to infer that in case of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact the states who are parties thereto have the right and are in duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil and for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities rights and liberties appertaining to them
 it appears to your committee to be a plain principle founded in common sense illustrated by common practice and essential to the nature of compacts that where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the parties the parties themselves must be the rightful judges in the last resort whether the bargain made has been pursued or violated
the constitution of the united states was formed by the sanction of the states given by each in its sovereign capacity
it adds to the stability and dignity as well as to the authority of the constitution that it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation
the states then being the parties to the constitutional compact and in their sovereign capacity it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated and consequently that as the parties to it they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition
it does not follow however because the states as sovereign parties to their constitutional compact must ultimately decide whether it has been violated that such a decision ought to be interposed either in a hasty manner or on doubtful and inferior occasions
even in the case of ordinary conventions between different nations where by the strict rule of interpretation a breach of a part may be deemed a breach of the whole,--every part being deemed a condition of every other part and of the whole,--it is always laid down that the breach must be both wilful and material to justify an application of the rule
but in the case of an intimate and constitutional union like that of the united states it is evident that the interposition of the parties in their sovereign capacity can be called for by occasions only deeply and essentially affecting the vital principles of their political system
the resolution has accordingly guarded against any misapprehension of its object by expressly requiring for such an interposition the case of a deliberate palpable and dangerous breach of the constitution by the exercise of powers not granted by it
 it must be a case not of a light and transient nature but of a nature dangerous to the great purposes for which the constitution was established
it must be a case moreover not obscure or doubtful in its construction but plain and palpable
lastly it must be a case not resulting from a partial consideration or hasty determination but a case stamped with a final consideration and deliberate adherence
it is not necessary because the resolution does not require that the question should be discussed how far the exercise of any particular power ungranted by the constitution would justify the interposition of the parties to it
as cases might easily be stated which none would contend ought to fall within that description,--cases on the other hand might with equal ease be stated so flagrant and so fatal as to unite every opinion in placing them within the description
but the resolution has done more than guard against misconstruction by expressly referring to cases of a deliberate palpable and dangerous nature
it specifies the object of the interposition which it contemplates to be solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of usurpation and of maintaining the authorities rights and liberties appertaining to the states as parties to the constitution
from this view of the resolution it would seem inconceivable that it can incur any just disapprobation from those who laying aside all momentary impressions and recollecting the genuine source and object of the federal constitution shall candidly and accurately interpret the meaning of the general assembly
if the deliberate exercise of dangerous powers palpably withheld by the constitution could not justify the parties to it in interposing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil and thereby to preserve the constitution itself as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it there would be an end to all relief from usurped power and a direct subversion of the rights specified or recognized under all the state constitutions as well as a plain denial of the fundamental principle on which our independence itself was declared
but it is objected that the judicial authority is to be regarded as the sole expositor of the constitution in the last resort and it may be asked for what reason the declaration by the general assembly supposing it to be theoretically true could be required at the present day and in so solemn|a manner
on this objection it might be observed first that there may be instances of usurped power which the forms of the constitution would never draw within the control of the judicial department secondly that if the decision of the judiciary be raised above the authority of the sovereign parties to the constitution the decisions of the other departments not carried by the forms of the constitution before the judiciary must be equally authoritative and final with the decisions of that department
but the proper answer to the objection is that the resolution of the general assembly relates to those great and extraordinary cases in which all the forms of the constitution may prove ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the essential rights of the parties to it
the resolution supposes that dangerous powers not delegated may not only be usurped and executed by the other departments but that the judicial department also may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the constitution and consequently that the ultimate right of the parties to the constitution to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated must extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by another by the judiciary as well as by the executive or the legislature
however true therefore it may be that the judicial department is in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the constitution to decide in the last resort this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact from which the judicial as well as the other departments hold their delegated trusts
on any other hypothesis the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers might subvert forever and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy the very constitution which all were instituted to preserve
the truth declared in the resolution being established the expediency of making the declaration at the present day may safely be left to the temperate consideration and candid judgment of the american public
it will be remembered that a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is solemnly enjoined by most of the state constitutions and particularly by our own as a necessary safeguard against the danger of degeneracy to which republics are liable as well as other governments though in a less degree than others
and a fair comparison of the political doctrines not unfrequent at the present day with those which characterized the epoch of our revolution and which form the basis of our republican constitutions will best determine whether the declaratory recurrence here made to those principles ought to be viewed as unseasonable and improper or as a vigilant discharge of an important duty
the authority of constitutions over governments and of the sovereignty of the people over constitutions are truths which are at all times necessary to be kept in mind and at no time perhaps more necessary than at present 
.these observations appear to form a satisfactory reply to every objection which is not founded on a misconception of the terms employed in the resolutions
there is one other however which may be of too much importance not to be added
it can not be forgotten that among the arguments addressed to those who apprehended danger to liberty from the establishment of the general government over so great a country the appeal was emphatically made to the intermediate existence of the state governments between the people and that government to the vigilance with which they would descry the first symptoms of usurpation and to the promptitude with which they would sound the alarm to the public
this argument was probably not without its effect and if it was a proper one then to recommend the establishment of a constitution it must be a proper one now to assist in its interpretation
