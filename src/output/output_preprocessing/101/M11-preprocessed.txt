point wtc7 7 foreknowledge of the collapse of world trade center building 7 introductionon september 11 2001 many people knew well before world trade center 7 collapsed that this 47 story high rise building was going to come down
1 there were even two premature announcements of the collapse by major television networks
how could this foreknowledge be explained
advocates of the official narrative of the collapse of wtc 7 have proposed at different times two differing explanations here called account 1 and account 2 which can both be called official accounts
account 1 the earlier explanation was widely disseminated on the internet and at one time received some support from the national institute of standards and technology nist thus making it a de facto official account
2]account 2 is the current official account of the collapse having been put forth in nist ’s final 2008 report
3]the official accounts account 1 wtc 7 was critically damaged by flying debris from the collapsing wtc 1 which caused structural damage and fires in wtc 7
these fires were especially large and hot being fed by diesel fuel stored in the building
4 seeing the structural damage and fires fire chiefs and engineers concluded that wtc 7 was in danger of collapse
concerns were therefore expressed and appropriate actions taken firefighters were withdrawn from the building and firefighters and others were told the building might come down
accordingly collapse predictions were rational responses to direct observation by witnesses
5]account 2 the earlier explanation of wtc 7 ’s collapse account 1 is incorrect
impact damage from flying debris caused by wtc 1 ’s collapse was insufficient to put wtc 7 at risk and did not play a significant role in its collapse
6 and the fires were not intensified by diesel fuel stored in the building
7]wtc 7 came down primarily due to fire
this was the first time in history that a steel framed high rise had collapsed due to fire
8 the fire triggered this collapse by means of a unique and unobserved sequence of events inside the building including thermal expansion of floor systems an unseated girder and floor collapses resulting in a cascade of column buckling
9]a single column failure had caused a complete north to south interior collapse which in turn precipitated a complete east to west interior collapse ultimately leaving the exterior columns laterally unsupported and causing all of them to buckle in a nearly simultaneous way
although the fires in wtc 7 were affecting the steel components of the building over a period of hours the building did not actually become unstable nor was its fate sealed until minutes or even seconds before it began to come down
10]the best evidence neither account 1 nor account 2 fits the evidence
contrary to what is often implied by supporters of the official 9/11 narrative witnesses who expected wtc 7 to come down evidently did not reach this conclusion because of anything they personally perceived but because of what they were told
11]what witnesses personally perceived most obviously can not explain account 2 which posits a sequence of last minute events inside the building that was unprecedented unpredictable and invisible to witnesses
but both accounts are contradicted by the facts thatsome people were certain that the building was going to come down thatsome of them had this certainty early and thatsome of the major media gave premature announcements of the collapse of wtc 7
on the issue of certainty msnbc reporter ashleigh banfield said early in the afternoon i ’ve heard several reports from several different officers now that that is the building that is going to go down next with one of them saying they ’re just waiting for that to come down at this point
12 and indeed many members of the fire department of new york are on record as having been confidently waiting for the building to come down
13 for example firefighter thomas donato said we were standing waiting for seven to come down
we were there for quite a while a couple hours
14]firefighter james wallace said they were saying building seven was going to collapse so we regrouped and went back to our rig
we went to building four or three i do n’t know
we were going to set up our tower ladder there
they said no good because building seven is coming down
we waited for building seven to come down
15]assistant commissioner james drury said i must have lingered there
there were hundreds of firefighters waiting to they were waiting for 7 world trade center to come down
16]chief thomas mc carthy said so when i get to the command post they just had a flood of guys standing there
they were just waiting for 7 to come down
17]paramedic steven pilla said we walked back
we did n’t do sic any further because building number seven was coming down
that was another problem to wait for building seven to come down
18]the evidence that many witnesses were certain of collapse which is solid 19 can not be explained either by account 1 or by account 2
the existence of early knowledge is also well supported firefighter vincent massa speaking of the firefighters waiting for wtc 7 to come down has said the whole time while we were waiting there were hours that went by
20]massa ’s estimate is confirmed by a wider study of the fdny oral histories
the study found that of 60 firefighters who mention predictions about the collapse of wtc 7 the times of these predictions can be determined in 33 cases in 17 cases the predictions occurred within the two hours before collapse while in the other 16 cases the predictions were made over two hours before collapse
in six cases the predictions were apparently made over four hours before collapse
21]some reports indicate that the fdny had been cleared from wtc 7 as early as 2 p.m. and had been told to abandon the building because it was doomed
22 this forecast appears to have come from mayor giuliani ’s office of emergency management
23]how could confident and valid collapse predictions have been made so far in advance
account 2 the current official explanation is especially incapable of answering this question since the unique and fatal internal collapse sequence central to this explanation was not witnessed by anyone and took place right before collapse
in any case since no steel framed building had ever collapsed before without being imploded there would have been no basis for such predictions
the official accounts are also contradicted by premature announcements of the collapse of wtc 7 by cnn and the bbc cnn announced the impending collapse of wtc 7 an hour and 10 minutes before it actually collapsed
24 directly after its premature announcement and intermittently for the following hour cnn displayed the caption building 7 at world trade center on fire may collapse
then 4.5 minutes prior to the collapse a new caption appeared building 7 ablaze poised to collapse
finally 3 minutes later there was another caption building 7 at world trade center on fire on verge of collapse
at no time during these 70 minutes could viewers see evidence of any alteration in wtc 7 such as increased fire partial collapse or even leaning
25]the collapse of wtc 7 was announced by the bbc 23 minutes prematurely
the bbc even gave a version of account 1 to explain why it collapsed
26 this premature announcement along with the explanation was especially peculiar given the fact that a steel framed building had never before collapsed because of fire
conclusionneither account 1 nor account 2 of the collapse of wtc 7 can account for the certainty of many people on the scene that the building was going to collapse the fact that some of them had this foreknowledge long in advance and that two of the tv networks were able to announce the collapse prematurely
this foreknowledge it would seem must have come from people who intended to bring the building down
this foreknowledge corroborates therefore the evidence and conclusions presented in previous points see consensus points wtc7 1 2 3 5 and 6 that wtc 7 was brought down through a process of controlled demolition

11]some firefighters on the scene made collapse predictions based on their own observations but they were outnumbered 7 to 1 by firefighters who derived their confidence in the imminence of collapse from others typically superior officers

additional reports to those listed below include:“the rest of the day we were unloading trucks
we were just doing whatever little things we could do but they were waiting for 7 world trade center to fall firefighter timothy burke p. 17 they pulled everyone back and everybody stood there and we actually just waited and just waited and waited until it went down emt joseph fortis p. 15
i remember later on in the day as we were waiting for seven to come down they kept backing us up vesey almost like a full block the whole time while we were waiting there were hours that went by vincent massa p. 17 19
they had figured they knew that building was going to come down
it was just a question of time and everybody was awaiting that
lieutenant russell stroebel p. 5 once they got us back together and organized somewhat they sent us back down to vesey where we stood and waited for seven world trade center to come down
