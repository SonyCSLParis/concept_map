twin towers forensic investigation help revise building codes despite critic federal disaster investigator issue 31 recommendation improve safety high rise emergency response critic emerge port authority new york new jersey
veteran disaster investigator stun fall twin towers september 11 2001
thought researcher probe calamity aside outrage happen engineering perspective
wtc 1 stand nearly twice long wtc 2 impact aircraft
world trade center building 7 plane hit stand seven hour collapse
building failure occur
answer question solve mystery lead change international building code help prevent future tragedy
great challenge u.s. national institute standards technology nist investigator face begin 2002 destruction main body evidence normally probe disaster
building content save structural steel skeleton demolish point unrecognizable practical use reconstruct condition prior aircraft impact say structural engineer shyam sunder lead investigator nist report world trade center disaster
instead team 200 investigator gather evidence reconstruct situation building face catastrophe
analyze 236 piece steel obtain wreckage represent grade steel building include piece impact aircraft affect fire
obtain 7,000 photograph roughly 7,000 video segment total excess 150 hour medium public agency individual photographer
compile review ten thousand page document interview 1,000 people scene involve design construction maintenance building
conduct lab test involve large fire heating structural component
investigator develop computer model tower damage impact jet fuel disperse fire evolve floor structure heat ultimately fail
simulation structure physical property material extraordinarily complex aircraft impact analysis require computation accurate microsecond sunder recall
time researcher invent new modeling capability simulation work mapping fire generate environmental temperature structural component building
new scientific understanding spray apply fire resistive material develop sunder say
turn combination high speed collision airliner fire multiple floor destroy twin towers accord nist final 2005 report collapse
robustness size structure help withstand hit absence damage fire intense one tower face likely lead collapse
unfortunately impact dislodge fireproofing insulation coat steel floor column leave metal vulnerable weaken fire
ceiling sprinkler work water supply cut collision
ultimately wtc 2 collapse quickly wtc 1 aircraft damage building core
give little time tower evacuate tower fully occupy 40,000 people total instead estimate 17,400 present 14,000 occupant die instead 2,749 perish attack
hand world trade center building 7 wtc 7 collapse hit aircraft
47 story office building catch fire debris wtc 1 fall flame spread uncontrolle sprinkler work city water line damage destruction twin towers
2008 report breakdown wtc 7 nist investigator conclude fire cause steel floor beam girder expand result unexpected structural weakness trigger progressive collapse know instance tall building bring primarily uncontrolled fire
light disaster nist issue 31 recommendation improve safety high rise emergency response face major threat
critic emerge recommendation include federal agency general services administration
concern include cost change happen convinced benefit think lack consensus result investigation note guy nordenson princeton professor architecture structural engineering run structural engineering firm new york involve nist investigation
early nist recommendation receive easily
instance late 20th century nist undertake large investigation building design readiness earthquake broad involvement engineering community recommendation widely accept field
problem world trade center investigation open adequately peer review veil security concern lot people disagree conclusion nordenson say
instance nordenson litigation suggest collapse wtc 7 inevitable design flaw fire protection aspect structure
sunder defend nist investigation note federal agency endeavor open inclusive possible numerous opportunity public engineering community review provide input public meeting comment period advisory committee meeting open public
stand conclusion wtc 7 say nist see datum analysis researcher lead nist reevaluate finding
 happen nist recommendation 23 change 2009 edition international codes 17 change 2012 edition responsive recommendation adopt sunder say
building safety code international code council typically adopt state local authority
 instance building tall 420 foot require include extra exit stairwell specially design elevator occupant use evacuation
stairwell building 75 foot high glow dark marking exit path light dim
addition spray apply fire resistive material perform time effectively current requirement building 75 420 foot tall seven time well building tall 420 foot
code change broad implication build safety sunder say
far new york city significant change response nist recommendation sunder note new project united states world trade center lead building new world trade center complex
speed magnitude scope change response recommendation world trade center investigation truly remarkable say
