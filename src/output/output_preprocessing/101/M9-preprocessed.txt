7 world trade center 7 world trade center is a building in new york city located across from the world trade center site in lower manhattan
the name 7 world trade center has referred to two buildings the original structure completed in 1987 and the current structure
the original building was destroyed on september 11 2001 and replaced with the new 7 world trade center which opened in 2006
both buildings were developed by larry silverstein who holds a ground lease for the site from the port authority of new york and new jersey
the destruction of building 7 is a focus of september 11 conspiracy theories
the original 7 world trade center was 47 stories tall clad in red exterior masonry and occupied a trapezoidal footprint
an elevated walkway connected the building to the world trade center plaza
the building was situated above a consolidated edison con ed power substation which imposed unique structural design constraints
when the building opened in 1987 silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants
in 1988 salomon brothers signed a long term lease and became the main tenants of the building
on september 11 2001 7 wtc was damaged by debris when the nearby north tower of the wtc collapsed
the debris also ignited fires which continued to burn throughout the afternoon on lower floors of the building
the building 's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires and the building collapsed completely at 5:21:10 p.m.
the collapse began when a critical column on the 13th floor buckled and triggered structural failure throughout causing at first the crumble of the east mechanical penthouse at 5:20:33 p.m.
the new 7 world trade center construction began in 2002 and was completed in 2006
it is 52 stories tall and still situated above the con ed power substation
built on a smaller footprint than the original to allow greenwich street to be restored from tri beca through the world trade center site and south to battery park the new building is bounded by greenwich vesey washington and barclay streets
a small park across greenwich street occupies space that was part of the original building 's footprint
the current 7 world trade center 's design places emphasis on safety with a reinforced concrete core wider stairways and thicker fireproofing of steel columns
it also incorporates numerous environmentally friendly features
1983–2001
the original 7 world trade center was a 47 story building designed by emery roth sons with a red granite facade
the building was 610 feet 186 m tall with a trapezoidal footprint that was 330 ft 101 m long
and 140 ft 43 m wide
tishman realty construction managed construction of the building which began in 1983
in march 1987 the building opened becoming the seventh structure of the world trade center
the building was constructed above a con edison substation that had been on the site since 1967
the substation had a caisson foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25 stories containing 600,000 sq ft 55,700 m²
the final design for 7 world trade center was for a much larger building covering a larger footprint than originally planned when the substation was built
the structural design of 7 world trade center included features to allow a larger building than originally planned to be constructed
a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders was located between floors 5 and 7 to transfer loads to the smaller foundation
existing caissons installed in 1967 were used along with new ones to accommodate the building
the fifth floor functioned as a structural diaphragm providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons
above the seventh floor the building 's structure was a typical tube frame design with columns in the core and on the perimeter and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames
a shipping and receiving ramp which served the entire world trade center complex occupied the eastern quarter of the 7 world trade center footprint
the building was open below the third floor providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp
the spray on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum based monokote which had a two hour fire rating for steel beams girders and truss and a three hour rating for columns
mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven including 12 transformers on the fifth floor
several generators in the building were used by the office of emergency management salomon smith barney and others
storage tanks contained 24,000 gallons 91,000 l of diesel fuel to supply the generators
fuel oil distribution components were located at ground level up to the ninth floor
after the world trade center bombings of february 26 1993 new york city mayor rudy giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7 world trade center
although this decision was criticized in light of the events of 9/11 the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building
the roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse
each floor had 47,000 sq ft 4,366 m² of rentable office space which made the building 's floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the city
in all 7 world trade center had 1,868,000 sq ft 174,000 m² of office space
two pedestrian bridges connected the main world trade center complex across vesey street to the third floor of 7 world trade center
the lobby of 7 world trade center had three murals by artist al held the third circle pan north xii and vorces vii
tenants in june 1986 before construction was completed silverstein signed drexel burnham lambert as a tenant to lease the entire 7 world trade center building for $ 3 billion over a term of 30 years
in december 1986 after the boesky insider trading scandal drexel burnham lambert canceled the lease leaving silverstein to find other tenants
spicer oppenheim agreed to lease 14 percent of the space but for more than a year as black monday and other factors adversely affected the lower manhattan real estate market silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space
by april 1988 silverstein had lowered the rent and made other concessions
in november 1988 salomon brothers withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at columbus circle in midtown and agreed to a 20 year lease for the top 19 floors of 7 world trade center
the building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate the needs of salomon brothers
most of three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors and more than 350 tons u.s. of steel were added to construct three double height trading floors
nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station
essentially salomon is constructing a building within a building and it 's an occupied building which complicates the situation said a district manager of silverstein properties
the unusual task was possible said larry silverstein because it was designed to allow for entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building 's structural integrity on the assumption that someone might need double height floors
 at the time of the september 11 2001 attacks salomon smith barney was by far the largest tenant in 7 world trade center occupying 1,202,900 sq ft 111,750 m² 64 percent of the building which included floors 28–45
other major tenants included itt hartford insurance group 122,590 sq ft/11,400 m² american express bank international 106,117 sq ft/9,900 m² standard chartered bank 111,398 sq ft/10,350 m² and the securities and exchange commission 106,117 sq ft/9,850 m²
smaller tenants included the internal revenue service regional council 90,430 sq ft/8,400 m² and the united states secret service 85,343 sq ft/7,900 m²
the smallest tenants included the new york city office of emergency management national association of insurance commissioners federal home loan bank first state management group inc. provident financial management and the immigration and naturalization service
the department of defense dod and central intelligence agency cia shared the 25th floor with the irs
floors 46–47 were mechanical floors as were the bottom six floors and part of the seventh floor
collapse as the north tower collapsed on september 11 2001 heavy debris hit 7 world trade center causing damage to the south face of the building
the bottom portion of the building 's south face was damaged by debris including damage to the southwest corner from the 8th to 18th floors a large vertical gash on the center bottom extending at least ten floors and other damage as high as the 18th floor
the building was equipped with a sprinkler system but had many single point vulnerabilities for failure the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps rather than being a fully automatic system the floor level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water
also water pressure was low with little or no water to feed sprinklers
after the north tower collapsed some firefighters entered 7 world trade center to search the building
they attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire but low water pressure hindered their efforts
a massive fire burned into the afternoon on the 11th and 12th floors of 7 world trade center the flames visible on the east side of the building
during the afternoon fire was also seen on floors 6–10 13–14 19–22 and 29–30
in particular the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon
at approximately 2:00 p.m. firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 world trade center between the 10th and 13th floors a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse
during the afternoon firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building
around 3:30 pm fdny chief daniel nigro decided to halt rescue operations surface removal and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 world trade center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel
at 5:20:33 p.m. edt on september 11 2001 7 world trade center started to collapse with the crumble of the east mechanical penthouse while at 5:21:10 p.m. edt the entire building collapsed completely
there were no casualties associated with the collapse
in may 2002 the federal emergency management agency fema issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the structural engineering institute of the american society of civil engineers under leadership of dr. w. gene corley p.e. fema made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 wtc and 2 wtc but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting
according to fema structural elements were exposed to high temperatures for a sufficient period of time to reduce their strength to the point of collapse nevertheless it has since been determined that the fires burned out in 20 minutes at any given location as they moved from point to point
the report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation loss of structural integrity was likely a result of weakening caused by fires on the 5th to 7th floors
the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time
although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence
further research investigation and analyses are needed to resolve this issue
in response to fema 's concerns the national institute of standards and technology nist was authorized to lead an investigation into the structural failure and collapse of the world trade center twin towers and 7 world trade center
the investigation led by dr s. shyam sunder drew not only upon in house technical expertise but also upon the knowledge of several outside private institutions including the structural engineering institute of the american society of civil engineers sei asce the society of fire protection engineers sfpe the national fire protection association nfpa the american institute of steel construction aisc the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh and the structural engineers association of new york seaony
the bulk of the investigation of 7 world trade center was delayed until after reports were completed on the collapse of the world trade center twin towers
in the meantime nist provided a preliminary report about 7 world trade center in june 2004 and since then has released occasional updates on the investigation
according to nist the investigation of 7 world trade center has been delayed for a number of reasons including that nist staff who had been working on 7 world trade center were assigned full time from june 2004 to september 2005 to work on the investigation of the collapse of the twin towers
in june 2007 shyam sunder explained we are proceeding as quickly as possible while rigorously testing and evaluating a wide range of scenarios to reach the most definitive conclusion possible
the 7 wtc investigation is in some respects just as challenging if not more so than the study of the towers
however the current study does benefit greatly from the significant technological advances achieved and lessons learned from our work on the towers
 in its progress report nist released a video and still photo analysis of 7 world trade center before its collapse that appears to indicate a greater degree of structural damage from falling debris than originally assumed by fema
specifically nist 's interim report on 7 world trade center displays photographs of the southwest facade of the building that show it to have significant damage
the report also highlights a 10 story gash in the center of the south facade toward the bottom extending approximately a quarter of the way into the interior
a unique aspect of the design of 7 world trade center was that each outer structural column was responsible for supporting 2,000 sq ft 186 m² of floor space suggesting that the simultaneous removal of a number of columns severely compromised the structure 's integrity
consistent with this theory news footage shows cracking and bowing of the building 's east wall immediately before the collapse which began at the penthouse floors
in video of the collapse taken from the north by cbs news and other news media the first visible sign of collapse is movement in the east penthouse 8.2 seconds before the north wall began to collapse which took at least another 7 seconds
the working hypothesis released in the june 2004 progress report and reiterated in a june 2007 status update was that an initial failure in a critical column occurred below the 13th floor caused by damage from fire and/or debris from the collapse of the two main towers
the collapse progressed vertically up to the east mechanical penthouse
the interior structure was unable to handle the redistributed load resulting in horizontal progression of the failure across lower floors particularly the 5th to 7th floors
this resulted in a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure
 on august 21 2008 nist released its draft report on the causes of the collapse of 7 world trade center beginning a period for public comments
in its investigation nist utilized ansys to model events leading up to collapse initiation and ls dyna models to simulate the global response to the initiating events
nist determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers
but the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor
the fires burned out of control during the afternoon including on floor 13 where a critical interior column buckled
with the buckling of that column adjacent columns also failed along with the floor structure above
this triggered a vertical progression of floor failures to the roof
the collapse then progressed east to west across the structure and ultimately the entire structure collapsed
the fires fueled by office contents along with the lack of water were the key reasons for the collapse
when 7 world trade center collapsed debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the borough of manhattan community college 's fiterman hall building located adjacent at 30 west broadway to the extent that the building was not salvageable
in august 2007 fiterman hall was scheduled for deconstruction
a revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new fiterman hall in 2012 at a cost of $ 325 million
the adjacent verizon building an art deco building constructed in 1926 had extensive damage to its east facade from the collapse of 7 world trade center though it was able to be restored at a cost of us$ 1.4 billion 7 world trade center housed sec files relating to numerous wall street investigations as well as other federal investigative files
all the files for approximately 3,000 to 4,000 sec cases were destroyed
while some were backed up in other places others were not especially those classified as confidential
files relating citigroup to the world com scandal were lost
the equal employment opportunity commission estimates over 10,000 cases will be affected
the secret service had its largest field office with more than 200 employees in wtc 7 and lost investigative files
says one agent all the evidence that we stored at 7 world trade in all our cases went down with the building
the collapse of 7 world trade center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires
world trade center controlled demolition conspiracy theories say that the building collapses on september 11 including that of building seven were the result of controlled demolition
the draft nist report rejected this hypothesis as the window breakages and blast sound that would have occurred if explosives were used were not observed
the use of thermate instead of explosives is discarded by nist on the basis that it is unlikely the necessary 100 pounds of thermate for each steel column could have been planted without being discovered
