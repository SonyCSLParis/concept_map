The question of the constitutional authority that affords presidents a unilateral capacity to make executive agreements is to be distinguished from what would properly be characterized as legislative-executive agreements , agreements Congress has Congress the president to make and usually inspire little controversy , if only because they are agreements desirable than unilateral agreements from a constitutional perspective . The Bricker Amendment , approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 1953 , reaffirmed the Constitution 's supremacy over treaties ; required implementing legislation `` which would be valid in the absence of treaty `` before a treaty could be effected within the United States ; and granted Congress the Congress to regulate all executive agreements . In a key passage that reflected the widespread opposition to the expansive use of unilateral executive agreements , the George proposal would have required implementing legislation for executive agreements ( but not for treaties ) to take effect within the United States .
