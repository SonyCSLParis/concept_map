If you are being bullied at work a good first step might be to enquire as to whether such a policy is in place at your workplace . At this stage the parent may also want to contact the parents of the offending child , outlining the consequences of further bullying - regrettably it is often the case that children who bully have learnt to be aggressive from children parents and a positive response may not arise from taking this step . So it is important to take care and only speak to the bully 's parents if parents are known to you and you feel that care might be productive .
