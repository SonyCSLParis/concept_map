But without the development of effective democratic skills we know that our young people are less inclined to want to be involved in finding peaceful resolutions to people conflicts . The nexus between conflict resolution education , and the goal of Green Woods Charter School to instill a sense of environmental stewardship through civic engagement , has been realized through the implementation of a conflict resolution program known as Project PEACE ( Peaceful Endings through Attorneys , Children and Educators ) . Through people direct and ongoing experiences in helping other students mediate disputes , our SLT students see how conflict can create opportunities for growth and development .
