Corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 22 states , according to court papers filed on behalf of the charter school , the School of Excellence in Education . You probably should have filed your complain in state court where your case would n't turn on the question of whether court was a violation of federal rights ( which in fact , court was ) . LAST THOUGHT : the school had no more legal power to hold power down and beat case when School expressed desire to vacate the premises than school would have had to visit School home or grab School on the street and beat School .
