And of course , there is the small but powerful desire of many students not to see students parents in the school . The reason for this is that we are in highschool now and should not need our parents to be involved in everything we do , not that it is a bad thing to have parents involved though , just to a certin extent . You indeed do not require your parents to be involved in everything you do , and I would suggest that most parents do not want that either .
