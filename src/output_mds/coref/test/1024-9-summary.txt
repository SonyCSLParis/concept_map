If you do n't reply and the person continues to harass you - or does other things like contacting your friends to talk about you , or writing bad things about you on a web page or social networking site - chances are good that you 're dealing with a cyber bully . With the help of an adult , contact the cyber bully once and tell bully or adult to stop bothering you . This is evidence that you are being harassed .
