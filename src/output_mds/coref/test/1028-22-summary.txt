The aims of this study are to examine children 's perceptions of protective ( parental monitoring , family closeness ) and risk factors ( conflict , liberality of parental attitudes towards antisocial behaviours and family history of substance misuse ) within children family environment , the extent to which these factors are associated with one another , and the associations of these risk and protective factors with children 's self reported drinking behaviour . Frequencies of alcohol consumption behaviours amongst secondary school children Associations between independent variables As demonstrated in Table 4 , there was a high degree of interrelationship among the different components of family functioning , with 'protective factors ' ( i.e . family closeness , parental monitoring ) positively correlated with one another , and negatively correlated with 'risk factors ' ( i.e . family conflict and violence , and liberality of attitudes towards alcohol/petty crime and substance use ) . While the CTC Youth Survey has previously been used in the UK to measure both young people 's alcohol-related behaviours and pertinent risk and protective factors ( such as the survey conducted in Plymouth , England ) [ 50 ] the current study is the first to analyse the relationships between these aspects of the survey within a UK context .
