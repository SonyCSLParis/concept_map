Do you really think that as a parent of an autistic child I have n't thought of all the things I may or may not have done wrong ? Lauren said This is nonsense ....... I have two children , both with autism ..... and maybe for not all cases , but for my two children children autism is hereditary ...... it is through children father 's side of the family which has nothing to do with obesity during pregnancy ( which I was not anywhere near during pregnancy ) , is has nothing to do with vaccines , or anything else . Deb said Okay that 's a load of crap -- the best shape I was in pregnancy wise was the child who has autism I have children other children who had a bigger birth weight and which I gained more weight children -- they are not autistic in any way .
