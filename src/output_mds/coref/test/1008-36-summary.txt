Parent handouts in coming weeks will give you a sense of the skills your child is learning . Â• Make it clear that resorting to violence is not acceptable to you , at home , at school or in the neighborhood . We hope you continue to learn and practice these skills in daily life and treat students as resources - with compassion and an attitude that learning to resolve conflict productively is important .
