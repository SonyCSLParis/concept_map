I think that even more of these Acts need to be passed because students need to be able to feel like students can go to school and learn just like everyone else and not feel like students will be harassed . These kids need to KNOW that help is there for students , that students SHOULD be sharing students stories to students school officials , and that something WILL be done . Some students think that bullying is not as harmful as bullying really is , but if students learn more about bullying , bullying may stop some students from bullying .
