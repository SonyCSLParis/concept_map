Tardiness Policy ( 8053 ) The following policy on tardiness was adopted by the Board of Education and may be found in the Policy Manual : Training for punctuality is a joint function of the home and the school in preparation for later life in the industrial , business , or professional world . Any pupil who is tardy will be required to present a note or tardiness form as required by the school , signed by the parent and stating the date and reason for the tardiness . This tardiness is to be noted in the school register and on world record card except in cases of approved tardiness for religious obligations , in which cases the school must be notified in writing the day before the tardiness occurs .
