I would not tolerate such a thing in my own children and if children were to begin to display such eating behaviour I would say something - not in front of children peers - but privately let children know , it 's wrong and front 's not healthy . front is the business of the parent and child , not yours , and if shaming children worked , there would not be a fat person in the whole country .
