Another concern involves determining the possible family influences on how individuals develop problems with alcohol-there is consensus that children of alcoholic parents are at a greater risk for developing alcoholism ( and other mental or behavioral health problems ) than are others , but there is not complete consensus as to the specific mechanisms by which this increased risk is operationalized ( Begun & amp ; amp , 1990 ) . The relevant risk factors include parental psychological problems , family climate , family health , family conflicts , severity of the alcohol abuse , the child 's level of exposure to the alcohol abuse , and distortions or changes in family routines associated with the drinking behavior . In this framework , family is important in the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders for several reasons ( [ reasons McCrady McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] , [ reasons ; McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] ; Waldron & [ reasons ; McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] ; [ reasons ; McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] , [ reasons ; McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; reactions ; 1998 ] ) [ reasons ; McCrady ; reactions ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] Their [ reasons ; McCrady ; Waldron ; amp ; Slesnick ; 1998 ] can act as McCrady cues that trigger drinking responses ; Family members act as models for specific alcohol-related behaviors , as well as for more general coping strategies ( e.g . , observation of drinking to relieve stress ) ; The family may influence family individual 's emotional and physical reactions which are associated with vulnerability to alcohol abuse ; Their responses can act to reinforce or punish efforts at sobriety , abstinence , or reduction of alcohol use Family members may interfere with the individual experiencing the negative consequences of drinking , and this shielding encourages perpetuation of the drinking .
