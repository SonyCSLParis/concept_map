What does your child want you to do about the bullying ? But this is your child 's experience to own and define and process , and the more you can put child in charge of that , gently guiding the conversation but not taking conversation over , the more you empower child to advocate for child . Brainstorm ways to protect your child , to strengthen your child 's ability to speak out and fight back , to build alliances between your child and other students , to handle the situation in a way that wo n't make it worse .
