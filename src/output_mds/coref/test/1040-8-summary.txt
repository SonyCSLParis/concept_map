You ca n't tell by looking that a person has a learning disability , which can make learning disabilities hard to diagnose . For example , disabilities may be able to sound out a sentence or paragraph perfectly , making disabilities good readers , but disabilities ca n't relate to the words in ways that will allow disabilities to make sense of what disabilities 're reading ( such as forming a picture of a thing or situation ) . For most people in disabilities teen years , the first telltale sign of most learning disabilities occurs when disabilities notice that there 's a disconnect between how much disabilities studied for a test and how well disabilities performed .
