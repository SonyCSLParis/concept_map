I do n't want heim to be hungry and even if heim says no , I know heim needs to eat so heim will have to eat . `` She shared everything She was having with She DD from an early age be it ice cappuccinos , to pop , to fast food , etc . , She DD was eating adult portions by 18 months I 'd say . Now when moms say moms do n't want to restrict food , I have a series question- do your kids ask for more once done a serving , do you offer more automatically , do you think youv given larger portions from the start and portions 're used to eating that much , do you know what the right sized portions for your child are , when do you stop , how do you know portions 're actually hungry ?
