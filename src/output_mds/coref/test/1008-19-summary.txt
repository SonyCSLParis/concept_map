Cummings , the Notre Dame Professor of Psychology , and researchers from Rochester University and the Catholic University of America , found that the manner in which parents handle everyday marital conflicts has a significant effect on how secure parents children feel , and , in turn , significantly affects parents future emotional adjustment . `` When destructive marital conflict erodes the bridge , children may lack confidence and become hesitant to move forward , or may move forward in a dsyregulated way , unable to find appropriate footing within children or in interaction with others . `` In the first study , the researchers examined the effect of marital conflict on the 9- to-18-year-old children of 226 parents for three years .
