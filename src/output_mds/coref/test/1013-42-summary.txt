About Montessori Early in the twentieth century , Maria Montessori developed educational materials and methods based on years of Montessori research , which showed that children learn best by doing , not by passively accepting other people 's ideas and pre-existing knowledge . The Montessori Method is dynamic in that observation and the meeting of needs is continual and specific for each child . The power of the Montessori teaching approach has been proven by modern research to enhance performance , interest , persistence , memory , and creativity in learning .
