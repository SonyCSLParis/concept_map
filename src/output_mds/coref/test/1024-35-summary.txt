This was not who I was . A complaint on the teachers & maybe the school school please let me know , i have almost 2 days before i meet with this principle `` `` Well i have to agree with the post of 10/7/2009 , what was suppose to be a new beginning for my daughter in High School as a Freshman and to worry about being new at this school and trying to figure out what classes or clubs you want to join and stressing not to get lost in school but know that your best friends and other familiar faces will be there for you has turned into a Nightmare . I kept questioning daughter everyday how everyday went anything i ever got was 'ok ' 'good ' After a month like this i had enough and called one mother in particular who of course i had befriended and asked her if daughter knew daughter was going on , she had daughter idea what i was talking about , and did n't want to get involved all she said daughter the exact same words i have been reading in the newspapers 'kids are kids and girls are cruel no biggy ' i biggy very hurt that since it was not biggy daughter going daughter this she did n't daughter care .
