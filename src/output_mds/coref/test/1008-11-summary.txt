Ways you can help your children When you begin to accept the separation then your children will be able to do the same - it is important that you get on with your life and not dwell in the past or hang on to any anger or bitterness . An important point to remember is that most children love both parents and although children may have many feelings about the separation , in most cases children miss children parents and want to keep in contact with parents . Children should be able to feel that both parents are positive about parents time with the other parent .
