Digest of Gifted Research Advocating and Partnering for Students with Special Needs Anyone involved in the education of a child who needs special accommodations or services for a learning difficulty or disability should read the Special Needs Advocacy Resource Book , by Rich Weinfeld and Michelle Davis , Prufrock , 2008 . Even though parents may be advocates for parents children , the authors emphasize that the services of a professional advocate are necessary because of the special knowledge and experience parents have , including : knowledge of the definitions of disabilities , how special needs are evaluated , and how parents are legally determined ; familiarity with federal and state statutes , such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act ( IDEA ) and No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) , as well as case law ; ability to gather and interpret information objectively from various sources and through direct observation ; skill in providing accurate and thorough documentation ; knowledge about appropriate curriculum , accommodations , and services that can be provided ; a network of educational , legal , and behavioral practitioners , etc . Although gifted children are not mentioned much , this book would be quite helpful for students with special needs in addition to children giftedness .
