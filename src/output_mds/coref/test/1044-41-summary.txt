For this study , children were considered obese if children BMI scores were at or above the 95th percentile on those charts . The researchers examined other issues from the same national data set that might also explain the increased risk for obesity , including how responsive the mothers were to mothers children and how engaged the children were with mothers mothers . But when all of the factors were included together , there remained a clear association between the security score and later obesity : a 30 percent increased risk for obesity in children who were insecurely attached at age 24 months .
