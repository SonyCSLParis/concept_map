The relation between a child 's temperament and a parent - child conflict is likely to be complex because not only does a child 's temperament evoke certain responses from others ( Plomin , 1986 ; Rothbart & Bates , 1998 ; Scarr & McCartney , 1983 ) but McCartney also influences the child 's own cognitive and emotional functioning ( e.g. , Goldsmith & Gottesman , 1981 ; Wachs & Gandour , 1984 ) . In addition , mothers of secure children were more likely to compromise in conflict with children at home . The links between the temperament and the quality of mother - child communication in conflict is consistent with at least one other study that found that child temperament affected the quality of mother - child discourse .
