More involvement is better , but you do n't have to be president of the PTO or run the school carnival . Kids develop better social skills and show improved behavior when Kids parents are involved at school . When parents become involved in Kids children 's education , Kids become more comfortable in the school building , gain confidence in Kids parenting skills , and feel more capable of helping Kids children learn .
