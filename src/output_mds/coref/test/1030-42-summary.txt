It is lawful in Australia to use corporal punishment to discipline children as long as the punishment is `` reasonable `` in the circumstances . There is no legislation concerning corporal punishment by parents in Victoria , however , there is a common law defence for parental use of corporal punishment . Section 257 of the code states that : it is lawful for a parent or a person in the place of a parent .... to use , by way of correction , toward a child or pupil under person care , such force as is reasonable under the circumstances .
