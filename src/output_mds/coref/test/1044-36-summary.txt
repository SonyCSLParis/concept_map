My first concern is that the authors take concern as a given that obesity is preventable and treatable by a change in the child 's environment . In addition , the authors state `` it may be unethical to subject such children to an invasive and irreversible procedure without first considering foster care . `` A study by Hadfield showed that children placed in foster care were more likely to be overweight and obese than the general population and 35 % had an increase in weight while in foster care .
