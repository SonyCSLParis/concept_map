It has only been since the 1980s that depression in children and adolescents has emerged as an issue at the forefront of professional concern. A report in the British journal, the Lancet in 1998, gave the details of a study conducted by Joseph Hibbeln of the National Institute of Health, which suggests that the consumption rate of Omega-3s found in vegetable oils, fish and shellfish is correlated to the rates of depression. It was found that there is a direct correlation to lower rates of depression in countries that consumed large amounts of fish.
