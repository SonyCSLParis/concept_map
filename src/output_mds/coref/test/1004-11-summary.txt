Depression and Children with ADHD As noted above , children with ADHD appear to be at increased risk for the development of depression . Recent research has suggested that in children with ADHD who are depressed , the depression is not simply the result of demoralization that can result from the day to day struggles that having ADHD can cause . The important point that can be taken from this study , I think , is that parents need to be sensitive to recognizing the symptoms of depression in parents child , and not to simply assume that study is just another facet of parents child 's ADHD .
