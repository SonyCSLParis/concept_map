You are fortunate to have a bright son , but there could be an issue with one of the above areas , and it would be best to find out which one so son can be addressed . I found son very helpful when I had my son tested as son brought us to a place where we could help issue for who issue was with and without issue diagnosis . If you decide to have a private agency do the testing , and areas recommend remediation , and you want the district to provide remediation you will have to go through the testing again .
