My younger son wants to spend time with son older brother and hang out in brother room with brother brother or when brother has friends over . Once I do , my older son will not hear anything I say even when I agree that brother has every right to be angry and frustrated but that brother needs to express brother anger in a non-violent way . They are friends and 11 .
