Many parents of special education students - including those with kids at IS 187 - say parents had no idea that parents beloved school was a possibility . You can apply to as many schools as you like , your zoned neighborhood school , or another neighborhood school that might have space , or a special program such as a dual language program or a charter school . All parents of incoming kindergartners may apply individually to as many schools as schools wish -- but the best odds of admission to a school you are n't zoned for is at a school with special programs .
