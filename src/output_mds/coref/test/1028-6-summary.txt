My research over the past 15 years has focused on developing more effective ways of integrating the assessment and treatment of addiction with the mental health , behavioral and family problems that are often linked to substance use in adolescents . It 's important for parents to be alert to any significant changes or decline in the following areas : Change in school performance such as decline in grades , decreased motivation to complete assignments or involvement in school activities ; skipping classes/truancy Significant changes in personal habits such as sleep ( sleeping much more or much less ) , level of activity , appetite ( increased or decreased ) , or hygiene Significant changes in behavior and/or mood such as increased irritability , aggression , decreased motivation , disregard for rules , mood swings , depression ; expressing suicidal thoughts or behaviors Decreased involvement in positive social activities such as team sports or school related activities ; loss of interest in a favorite hobby Association with a deviant peer group , gang involvement ; legal problems A significant change in mood , behavior , academic performance , or peer group does not necessarily mean that your teenager is involved with drugs or alcohol .
