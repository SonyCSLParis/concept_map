Finding ways to make these families feel comfortable in our school setting and making it possible for families to be involved in positive ways is the challenge . I believe the problem can be addressed by creating and sponsoring activities to promote parent involvement in schools at times that are convenient to parents and with welcoming events that will encourage parents to feel comfortable in the school setting . Parents who want to be involved get lost in the crowd or are underutilized by school staff with no idea how to make use of parents as a resource .
