Your credit report contains information about any credit you have , including credit cards , car loans , and student loans . Moreover , if your principal balances have n't changed much ( and balances do n't in the early years of loans with long repayment terms ) or if balances 're getting larger ( because you 've taken a forbearance on your student loans and the accruing interest is adding to your outstanding balance ) , interest may look to a prospective lender like you 're not making much progress on paying down the debt you already have .
