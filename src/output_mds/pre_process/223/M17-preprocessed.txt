royalhill19871176 fall byzantine empire 
 manuel komnenos blame fall byzantine empire 
 contrary popular opinion go 
 fact go 
 go argue entire komnenian restoration byzantine empire failure komnenian system deeply flawed 
 crusader march ephesus picture attack outside town seljuk turks 
 locate western asia minor ancient greek city ephesus great hellenistic city ancient world 
 roman period ephesus large city asia minor estimate 500,000 population 100ad 
 town clearly fall hard time 12th century 
 fact turks attack crusader army gate ephesus time region supposedly mile frontier philomelion near iconium show far byzantine empire fortune actually fall 
 context distance equivalent scottish army marching south england arrive cambridge stone throw london meet resistance 
 imperial army 
 turks outside ephesus hundred mile inside nominally byzantine territory 
 byzantines turks ephesus control actually territory 
 komnenian restoration suppose restore empire fortune emperor alexios john ii manuel komnenos consider great empire history 
 believe empire recovery unsound 
 komnenos emperor good manager truly great 
 fail recover anatolia empire true heartland lose turks follow disaster manzikert decade civil war follow defeat emperor romanos diogenes 
 manuel komnenos march central anatolia head huge imperial army defeat turks 
 goal capture iconium capital suljuk turks 
 failure mark attempt oust turks asia minor 
 manuel foreign policy like predecessor john ii little short lunacy time 
 manuel waste huge amount resource fail invasion italy heartland territory asia minor threaten turks 
 send fleet army conquer egypt fail 
 play medieval ii total war able testify send huge fleet attack egypt turks large central anatolia insane 
 campaign manuel build fortress dorylaeum right northwest asia minor area firm byzantine control 
 attack turks construction 
 turks dorylaeum difficult argue concern emperor war italy hungary worthy time comparison 
 know byzantine history know anatolian theme establish 7th century heartland byzantine empire 
 provide core homeland empire manpower taxation revenue administration army 
 asia minor byzantium shadow 
 base weak foundation 
 population figure rough idea problem 
 
 modern greece population million 
 
 modern turkey population million 
 glance control asia minor vital importance byzantium 
 obviously population number change hugely 12th century today 
 suspect ratio different 
 greece probably represent million extra people cram territory turkish greek population exchange 
 return byzantine empire 
 john ii komnenos see good komnenian emperor 
 fact campaign actually add territory asia minor empire 
 essentially contribute southern coast asia minor defeat breakaway state attempt northeast take peripheral town north lose soon gain gangra example 
 john campaign syria 1130 1140s bit idiotic manuel later adventure egypt 
 john march syria head far large army asia minor campaign achieve absolutely 
 pure waste time money empire resource far well use interior anatolia 
 campaign far south east antioch turks kastamonu home town komnenos family 
 madness 
 early suspect far people take anna komnena account reign alexios i. 
 fact fail retake anatolia time crusade 
 year reign c1095 byzantine town asia minor actually hold lose turks 
 philomelion instead put end iconium evacuate greek population retreat 
 alexander great figure 
 want komnenian system nepotism rule instead merit fundamentally undermine effectiveness empire leadership time leave 
 azarius baliosi know manuelos komnenos fall eastern empire know komnenian dysnaty want rid seljuk turk anatolian country forget roman army long tagmata obliterate manzikert thank frankish normans mercenary avoid battle like legion enter teutoberg forest germania missing second crusader mainly want jerusalem instead force turks 
 doubt fall empire capital successor state 
 blame crusader weaken roman catholic church help instead want 
 kirialaxthanks fabulous thoughtful 
 certainly agree nice manuel remain contested figure 
 past generally malign follow choniates treatment paul magdalino magnificent book rehabilitate reputation 
 solve problem glad continue engage material 
 certainly deny komnenian emperor fail drive turks anatolia remain skeptical generally foreign policy 
 easy fault millennium later rise ottomans asia generally control numerous war turkish group 
 wonder komnenoi actually want rid turks generally occupy marginal upland region intensive agriculture possible give divided fractious political situation byzantium feel little reason try rid major niusance convenient group available mercenary 
 need remember prior modern era asia minor actually crappy land 
 extension steppe able support large population 
 coastline hand fertile find surprise komnenoi effort hold 
 themata heartland empire gain manpower coastal region hardly fault komnenoi defunct century alexios take throne dysfunctional decade 
 good take apart arab raid piecemeal good handle offensive warfare tenth century civil war basil ii effectively see dissolve 
 agree anna komnene read carefully alexios priortize balkans 
 normans prove capable take italy dyrrachion fall road constantinople largely open 
 dyrrachion fall alexios army destroy robert guiscard political game long retreat keep capital safe 
 alexios focus asia leave flank dangerously expose enemy prove capable impressive feat siege engineering 
 turks record have fleet pirate aegean threaten alexios government 
 follow normans balkans invade time pechenegs give alexios breathing room 
 pechenegs defeat alexios cuman ally turn fight balkan war 
 time indication alexios prepare bridgehead nikomedeia invasion asia force turn army west handle passage crusade 
 myriokaphalon manuel certainly defeat defeat get attention think prestige defeat 
 manuel violate treaty construct castle konya territory 
 manage defeat turkish force send destroy 
 myriokephalon crush defeat byzantine arm skeptical rapid come 
 auhcxami'm skeptical asia minor heartland theory 
 certainly crucial 7th century 12th different time believe western province productive economically far asia minor go byzantines hold fertile populated coastal region kirialax mention

 good point agree 
 fact exactly problem 
 concentrate effort drive turks clearly 
 book development komnenian army historian j. birkenmeier basically say byzantine campaign asia minor largely defensive intend force 
 point show force largely meaningless long run 
 build great empire show frontier year march troop day retreat home achieve 
 alexander great famous conquer enemy 
 basil ii great lead annual campaign bulgarians year nearly year conquer completely 
 kind leadership byzantium need turks 
 instead john ii campaign piecemeal turks commit resource hold territory 
 example capture gangra near ankara garrison city 2,000 man 
 soon lose turks 
 feel comfortable invade syria vast imperial army 40,000 man territory away add value empire 
 manuel komnenos give lot time asia minor waste entire reign year fight peripheral territory hungary italy egypt serbia have peace turks 
 result campaign give empire huge cost benefit 
 clear campaign konya field army 40,000 man 
 konya actually sack frederick barbarosa crusade 
 city fall crusade 
 lack komnenian period mobilise entire resource empire fight anatolia regain
