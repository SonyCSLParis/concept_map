Banks and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are encouraging parents to have a discussion with children about online safety and protecting their identity from criminals. "You can't always be there to monitor your kids 24/7, so it is important as parents to do as much as you can to help your kids to help themselves." Advice for anyone who has come across Internet content they feel might is inappropriate or illegal may be found at the Australian Communications and Media Authority: www.acma.gov.au Ensure your child knows they can talk to you about anything they experience online - it's important that you explain to your children that, if they are concerned about what they have done or what they have seen online, they can come and speak to you and that you'll understand and help them deal with the issue.
