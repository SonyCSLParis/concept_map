Montessori Programs in Public Schools. A survey conducted by the author in 1981 collected data from 25 of the approximately 50 school districts known to have Montessori programs at the time (Chattin-McNichols, 1981). Results from this study indicate that the number of students in the schools or school districts averaged 233, with an average of 10 teachers per program.
