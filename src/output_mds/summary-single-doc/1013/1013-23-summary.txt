Alvernia Montessori School History of Alvernia Montessori School When the Montessori School began at Alvernia in the fall term of 1963, it was regarded as part of the teaching program of Alvernia University (then, Alvernia College). Because the Provincial Superior of the Bernardine Sisters, Sister M. Blanche, did not allow the School to continue on the grounds of Alvernia University, the Directors moved the Montessori Children's House to Centre Avenue in Reading. Sister Ann Marie Coll became the Second Director of the Alvernia Montessori School during the 1979-1980 school year, and continues as the Director of the school today.
