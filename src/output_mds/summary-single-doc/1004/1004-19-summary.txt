12 This brief profiles several emerging efforts to target depression in parents of young children, including such strategies as: screening and follow-up for women, typically in ob/gyn or pediatric practices; targeted interventions to reduce maternal depression and improve early parenting in early childhood programs such as home-visiting and Early Head Start Programs; and promoting awareness about the impact of maternal depression and what to do about it for the general public, low-income communities, and early childhood and health practitioners. At the local level, communities can: conduct a community scan to assess local capacity for screening and following-up for pregnant women and parents of babies and young children and to identify how existing resources are used; engage local funders, including community foundations, to develop a strategic plan and implementation steps to help local early childhood programs test and/or replicate evidence-based, effective family focused practices to address maternal depression and its impact on young children; assess and strengthen community capacity to address depression in fathers as well as mothers, and in others who care for young children on a daily basis, whether in families or in child care settings; engage leaders of low-income communities in designing and evaluating public awareness campaigns and culturally and linguistically responsive outreach and program strategies; document disparities and implement strategies to track and improve access to culturally and linguistically responsive instructions; and combine public and private dollars to support early childhood mental health consultants to work with home-visitors and other caregivers. At the state level, public officials and advocates can: use ECCS grants to help health care providers and systems implement a developmental multi-generational family health/mental health perspective, including attention to prenatal depression and related risks as part of implementing the medical/dental home vision; dedicate a staff person to coordinating interagency screening, prevention and treatment efforts to address depression through a family lens, paralleling positions that have been created for to coordinate cross-agency activities around women's health or HIV/AIDS; develop a cross-agency strategic action plan to reduce maternal depression and its impact on young children that identifies what each system will do separately and together, such as: - build on medical home initiatives and perinatal screening initiatives, making sure there is appropriate follow-up treatment; - support cross-training efforts for primary care providers in health and early care and learning settings; - expand early childhood mental health strategies to include attention to depression in staff and families; - provide support to expand access to screening and follow-up treatment for pregnant and parenting mothers through both health practices and early childhood programs; - train and identify mental health consultants with documented expertise in dealing with depression through a family lens to work with pediatricians, early care and learning programs and women's health agencies; and - embed attention to depression beyond health and early childhood systems and programs (especially TANF, marriage initiatives, WIC, child welfare, etc.)
