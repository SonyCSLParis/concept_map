Children can suffer from many of the same depressive disorders as adults. If you notice changes in your child's behavior, and if those changes continue or worsen, it's important to contact your child's pediatrician to first rule out an underlying physical cause. As a parent, you have a right to ask questions and be informed about every step of your child's treatment, and you should do so.
