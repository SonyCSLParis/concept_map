In addition to being special needs educational advisor for families with twice-exceptional children and Contributing Editor to the new publication 2e: Twice-Exceptional Newsletter , I am co-founder and co-listowner of the GT-Special email list for families with gifted/special needs children - founded because my co-listowner and I needed a place where we could talk with other parents about our uniquely gifted children. It can be difficult for siblings of special needs children to understand that parents are not favoring the special needs child, that he or she truly has severe learning issues, yet at the same time to know that we empathize with their frustrations. http://www.newhorizons.org/ Resource Room - The Resource Room is a website with tools for learning, especially for people who learn differently or who have "learning difficulties" or specific "learning disabilities."
