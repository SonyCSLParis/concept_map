PLUS Loans If Stafford and Perkins loans aren't enough, the student's parents may take out an additional loan known as the PLUS Loan. So if school costs $10,000 per year and the student is receiving $8,000 from other sources, the maximum PLUS Loan would be $2,000. Now it's debt for college education.
