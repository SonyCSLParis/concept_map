And if you have ADHD, there's a pretty good chance that you may also have a learning disability. If you haven't been diagnosed with a learning disability and think you have one, tell your teacher, parents, or guardian. There's no one test for ADHD, so diagnosis can involve talking with you, checking your school records, and doing a physical exam to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms.
