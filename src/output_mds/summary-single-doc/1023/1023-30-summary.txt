Approaches for Students with LD Social Skills Training. The use of counseling is supported by a meta-analysis of school-based interventions with the aim of increasing the self-concept of children and youth with LD. It underscores the need for interventions that change the classroom and school environment in order to improve peer group interactions and to support changes made by the child in his or her social functioning (Wenz-Gross & Siperstein, 1997).
