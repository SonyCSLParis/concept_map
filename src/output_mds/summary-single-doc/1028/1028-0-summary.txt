Little is known about the role of men in paternity and parenting outside of marriage; thus, the results will provide basic information on how a man's background, experiences, and attitudes influence the timing and sequencing of marriage and paternity. Researchers are examining 1) the emotional and financial contributions of men to their children, 2) factors that inhibit or facilitate their involvement in parenting, 3) the male role in parenting children outside of marriage, and 4) racial differences in family formation behavior and parenting. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) funds numerous studies on the role of family in the development and prevention of alcohol disorders among children and adolescents.
