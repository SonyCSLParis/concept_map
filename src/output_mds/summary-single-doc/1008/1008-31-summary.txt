When conflict strikes a family it is important for each member to keep communicating with the others, even if they disagree about the issue at hand. Obviously the family-member who is involved with this person likes them a lot and will be at a loss to understand why their siblings and/or parents do not also like them. If the relationship thrives it may be the case that this outsider will have to be tolerated for the sake of good relations within the family.
