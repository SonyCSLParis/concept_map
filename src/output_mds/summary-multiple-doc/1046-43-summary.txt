No matter how little or how much time you have, there are many ways you can positively impact your child's education at school and at home. Ask your school about the Parent Teacher Association or Parent Teacher Organizations, school council, parent advisory committees or other parent organizations and then join one. If you don't know your schools website ask your child's teacher or the school.
