According to Scott Counseling, some things that parents do that send confusing messages about drugs and alcohol include: *Not talking about tobacco and drugs *Misusing/abusing legal drugs, such as alcohol, in front of our children *Misusing/abusing prescription medication in front of our children *Watching and laughing at TV sitcoms that include adults misusing/abusing mood altering chemicals (1) Not talking to children about drugs is sometimes the most damaging thing a parent can do, because if a child doesn't get their ideas on drugs and alcohol from their parents, then the chances that they will get them from a public largely obsessed with recreational drug use and drinking are high. 800-706-9190 Perhaps the most common role that parents play in the addiction of their children is that of the enabler - a person who - consciously or not - makes the drug use of the addict possible. An enabler can be a parent who simply makes excuses for the drug use or drinking of their children, or they can be much more damaging.
