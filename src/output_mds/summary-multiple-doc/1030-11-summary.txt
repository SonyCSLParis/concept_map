The term does not include: physical pain caused by reasonable physical activities associated with athletic training, competition, or physical education; or the use of restraint as authorized under Section 37.0021.# Section 37.0011 goes on to state that a school district is permitted to use corporal punishment (provided that the district has adopted a policy permitting the use) unless a student's parent or guardian  has previously provided a written, signed statement prohibiting the use of corporal punishment as a method of student discipline  # While this language provides parents a method of "opting out" of the use of corporal punishment, it also places the responsibility of preventing the use of corporal punishment on the parents. Such written and signed statement must be provided to the District each year in order to continue the prohibition of such punishment.# A parent's prohibition of corporal punishment may be revoked at any time by submitting a separate signed, written statement.# Questions have arisen about this topic, however, based on the TASB Policy Service recommended FO (LOCAL) policy issued with the recent Update 91. Historically, school districts have had the right to  inflict moderate corporal punishment for the purpose of restraining or correcting the refractory student,  as long as that punishment is reasonable.# When the right to use corporal punishment was challenged as  cruel and unusual punishment,  the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal law's prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishment" under the 8th Amendment was "inapplicable" to corporal punishment in public schools.# Furthermore, Section 22.0512(c) of the Education Code recognizes a district's right to use corporal punishment, and specifically states that nothing in this section of the Education Code prohibits a school district from  enforcing a policy relating to corporal punishment  # But before you go swinging into action, remember that corporal punishment must be reasonable and must not be excessive.
