The system was good, it worked--she would lay on her bed sobbing about the inequality of life until she fell asleep, and then she would come to me with a new round of, "But can I just..." When she turned eleven, there was a shift in the program. It is when my daughter is inside her room screaming at me that I exercise the discipline that my mother taught me: Rather then going into her room and lining her out for her bad behavior, I walk away so I can no longer hear her, and she wails til she is done and she falls asleep. I don't think I could have done anything different that would have changed her twelve year old behavior and to be honest--other than the screaming about the ways I violate her right to party--my girl is perfect.
