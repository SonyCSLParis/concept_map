Tell them what you want them to do; Letting children know how you want them to behaviour at school in a positive way is really helpful, such as "Sharing the toys and listening to the teacher," rather than what you don't want such as, "Don't go fighting and don't be naughty", Explaining as much as you think they will understand helps them to be well prepared. Set the boundaries as children don't know them and you will put your child at ease if they know them, so be careful not to accidentally reward crying and clingy behaviour by staying, as this will prolong the agony and children quickly realise that if they make a fuss mummy or daddy will stay a little longer. When you pick your child up again from school, it is really encouraging to give them some praise for their efforts from going into school, even if they cried a little.
