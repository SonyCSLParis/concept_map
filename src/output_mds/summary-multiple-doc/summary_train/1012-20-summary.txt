In addition to working with individual colleges, HSLDA is dialoguing with organizations such as the American Council of Education, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, and the National Association of College Admissions Counselors to help develop guidelines for colleges to deal with homeschoolers seeking admission. In analyzing college aptitude, Galloway and Sutton found that homeschooled students demonstrate similar academic preparedness [and] achievement in college as students who have attended conventional schools. They concluded that, consistent with the success of homeschoolers at the elementary and secondary levels, homeschooled students can perform adequately in the different, and more advanced, academic setting of college-level study. 8 Findings Reported in the Wall Street Journal Formerly homeschooled students enrolled at Boston University in the past four years have a 3.3 grade-point average (out of a possible 4.0) giving a good indicator of their overall success. The law now simply states that, in lieu of an accredited high school diploma or GED, a student is eligible for federal financial aid if "the student has completed a secondary school education in a homeschool setting that is treated as a homeschool or a private school under state law."
