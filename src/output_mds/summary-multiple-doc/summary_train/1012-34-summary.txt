This article makes it appear that facilitating positive socialisation is extra to a teachers role, so therefore can one deduce that a teachers main function is teaching and the rest perhaps is what they have to do because parents don't? This study compares 53 home-schooled, 49 private-schooled, and 48 public-schooled children between the ages of 8 and 12 on social skills, as measured by the Parent and Student Forms of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). The author argues that customizing a child's education through homeschooling represents the victory of a consumer mentality within education, as if the purpose of education were to please and satisfy the preferences of the consumer.
