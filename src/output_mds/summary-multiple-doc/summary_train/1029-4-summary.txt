Today we know that: The human brain is not fully developed until 22-25 years of age The younger a person begins use of alcohol or other drugs the quicker they can become addicted According to the National Institute of Health, those who begin drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who begin at age 21 We also know that children coming from a family history of alcoholism/addiction are at much higher risk to become addicted, even if raised in a home without alcohol or other drugs Knowing these risk factors a parent can be secure in the knowledge that this is a serious health issue, not a moral issue or a rite of passage. Let your child know you will check with a friend's parent when there are plans for a party or overnight Talk about having a plan if your child finds themselves in a situation where there is alcohol or other drugs Let them know what privileges they can earn over time as they demonstrate responsible decision making Let them know that if they break trust what privileges will be lost Set boundaries and follow through with natural consequences when trust is broken Work with your partner to send consistent, firm and loving messages Know it is OK to be your child's parent and not their friend at this time in their lives. Kids will often do as they see you do, not as you say.
