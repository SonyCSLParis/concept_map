No, but we take the children to parks in Battery Park City and we make use of the play spaces which we have indoors. The remainder of the toys are disinfected according to the children's use * at least daily for infants and toddlers, and as needed for preschoolers. Yes, but we ask that the toys be placed in the child's cubby when they arrive at school.
