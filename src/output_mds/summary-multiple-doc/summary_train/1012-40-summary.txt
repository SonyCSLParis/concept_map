At the end of your school year, you turn in an evaluation of your child's progress to your PA . I expect that, as the years go by, and the work becomes more demanding, we will be spending more time on "paperwork," and our days will probably become more "schoolish," but for now, we appreciate how Time4Learning helps us keep track of all the things we need to learn, but doesn't keep us tied to a desk in order to do so. Make Time4Learning a part of your children's homeschool resources.
