Some reasons for shyness include: being "born shy" - some babies seem to be more "sensitive" and easily frightened from birth on the whole family do not relate easily to other people - shy parents are more likely to have shy children - but not always the child may be afraid to be separated from the people he knows best - this is common in the preschool years the child may have lived fairly quietly in early childhood and not have had the opportunity to meet many other people, so the world seems more scary until he gets used to it a child who has not had many children to play with may be shy with children at first, but quite at ease with adults some children are afraid of doing the wrong thing or making a mistake if they join in the child has been pushed to do things before he was ready to - too high expectations the child has very fearful parents, who try very hard to protect him but this can make him afraid of the world the child has been ill-treated and is fearful the child has a disability or hearing loss that makes social life more difficult for him the child is very much more interested in things than in people, or does not seem to be able to understand how to relate to others - this can be caused by a developmental problem and if it happens most of the time, needs to be checked by a health professional. Encourage them and enjoy their successes but setting standards too high can mean that they will always feel they cannot really please you and this can help make children shy. It is not helpful to force children to do things they are afraid of - help your child to confront problem situations gradually, a little at a time.
