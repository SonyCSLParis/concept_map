This will be the first Montessori school offering education up to the 6th grade in the whole of Costa Rica. Our dream is to create an international Montessori bilingual school for primary and secondary levels, the continuation of the work started in 2003 at our present location in Cabuya. Our goal is to open a space for the education of our children in the beauty of Nature, the biggest laboratory.
