This would apply to treatments where only open trials, and not double-blind controlled trials, have been done. This rating would be given to treatments where replicated double-blind trials are available, but where it is not completely clear who is best suited for the treatment. For example, a treatment may be known to help children with ADHD, but it may be effective for only a minority of the ADHD population and the specific subgroup it is effective for is not clearly defined.
