Parents slam religious 'segregation' CONTROVERSIAL religious instruction classes are three times more likely to be taught at government primary schools in Melbourne's eastern suburbs than in the ethnically diverse west. Yarraville West Primary is one of 71 state primary schools in Melbourne's western suburbs that does not offer special religious instruction. ''We have raised the issue of how we would feel if we were approached and basically told we had to deliver special religious instruction without us having a choice in the matter and that certainly concerned our school council,'' Ms Thomas said.
