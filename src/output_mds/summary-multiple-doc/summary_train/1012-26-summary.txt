Given the leeway allowed private schools (which home schools in Texas legally are) to approve any firearm program at all, it's clear that the plaintiffs have sufficient relief from any alleged prohibition in their private residence. However, if an exclusion is made EVEN ONCE, what would prevent any of the 17 states, or the federal government, from citing this decision as reason to deny home schools their "private school" status and use it as the gateway to regulate home school programs? Magaw wrote that "Should a 'home' school be recognized by State law as a 'school' as defined by section 921(a)(26), the possession of a firearm on the grounds of such school or within 1,000 feet of school grounds would violate the law."
