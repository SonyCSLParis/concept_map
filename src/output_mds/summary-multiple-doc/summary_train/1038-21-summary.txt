I don't know if that helps but... same boat Why don't you look at it this way: school teachers have quite a lot of experience with kids and probably have a lot of great advice for you!. anonymous My kid who has very little experience in ''away from home'' care (ie: preschool,day care, babysitting by non family for more than 2 or 3 hours) is about to go to kindergarten (which is all day now, not half days) in Oakland, and I want to hear from people who have been in this situation and how they and their child coped, what problems arose, if any, and also what positive things you have to say or advice you have to help us through the immenent transition. good luck and after you've cried it out, think about how lucky you are to have this great child who has a great school and is starting to grow up... jill my son is nearly five,,, in november and has just started kingdergarten,, i know he is on the young side i am somewhat concerned about him,, the teacher has already spoken to me more than once about how he gets easily distracted,,, is brillant when he can focus,,, is very very energetic and gets overly excited,, silly in class to the point of bumping into,, or pushing other children he says he is sad alot,,, and that he does not like it,,, i know part of that is transition, and wanting to be at home with mother,,, but i worry he will be the trouble kid,,, the one that wont make the grade,, be able to say his numbers,,etc any opinions, concerned mother Perhaps you should think about transferring your son to a preschool that goes till age 5 or 6 (sometimes called the third year of preschool).
