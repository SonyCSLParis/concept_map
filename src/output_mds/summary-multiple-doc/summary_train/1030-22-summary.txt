Section 160.261, RSMo , requires the local board of education to establish rules for student conduct and that school district teachers, administrators and staff hold every student accountable for any disorderly conduct in school. A suspension for a period of not less than one year, or expulsion, for a student who is determined to have brought a weapon to school in violation of district policy and whether a superintendent, or in a district with no high school, the principal may modify such suspension on a case-by-case basis. If the suspension is in excess of ten days or an expulsion, state statute requires that the school must provide the student with appropriate due process.
