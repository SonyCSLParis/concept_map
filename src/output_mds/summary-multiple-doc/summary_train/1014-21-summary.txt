Lead by example Young teenagers with one or more parents who smoke are more than three times more likely to experiment with smoking, and older teenagers are almost three times more likely to smoke regularly than the teenagers of parents who do not smoke. Evaluation of the 2001 Parents campaign (featuring a young girl recounting a recent event to her dying father: 'You should have been there, Dad'), and focus group and tracking research on the WA Cancer Council's testimonial advertisement depicting a real smoker talking about her fears about what will happen to her children when she dies,[402] suggests that narrative adverts can have a strong impact with low SES parents. Given the likely impact on both parents and children, Quit campaigns should see parents as an important target group for advertising.
