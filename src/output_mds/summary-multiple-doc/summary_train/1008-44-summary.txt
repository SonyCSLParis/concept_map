In order to help address the training and technical assistance needs of domestic violence advocates, the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence (NRCDV) developed this brief collection on Conflict Resolution Tools and Resources for Domestic Violence Shelter Staff. As the earlier chart described, shelter residents participating in the Shelter Study raised particular areas of concern about a number of aspects of shelter life, most of which could result in conflict with staff or other residents, and which were resolved less frequently: "Problems with shelter rules included issues with time limits (16%), curfew (14%), child discipline and monitoring (13%), and chores (13%)." How might Suki's past experiences with domestic violence and at the shelter, including past conflicts with staff, contribute to this situation?
