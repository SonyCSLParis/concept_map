Facts about Social Phobia Social phobia, also called social anxiety, is a disorder characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. Social phobia can be limited to only one type of situation-such as a fear of speaking in formal or informal situations, or eating or drinking in front of others-or, in its most severe form, may be so broad that a person experiences symptoms almost anytime they are around other people. The second level is to increase the risk for disapproval in that situation so people build confidence that they can handle rejection or criticism.
