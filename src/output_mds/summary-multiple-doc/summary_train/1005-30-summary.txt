My 13 year old son thinks my husband is wonderful and is very happy. If your partner makes the rules for your daughter and you expect her to obey them, I believe you are decreasing the possibility dramatically that she will ever have a good relationship with him or him with her. While perhaps she does need counseling, I believe that you will find it more useful to get counseling for the whole family, or for you and your partner, to learn how to help your daughter adjust, without feeling as if she's being punished for struggling to do so.
