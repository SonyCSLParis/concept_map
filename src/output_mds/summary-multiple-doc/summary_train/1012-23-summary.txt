Benefits to Homeschooling: Making The Right Choice Young mom wants to share some of the benefits to homeschooling with her public schooled husband... Hi, I have one son, he's a year and a half, and I'm trying to figure out what is the best choice for him: public school, or homeschool? I don't want that to happen to my son, and yet I know that homeschooling is so much more beneficial to the individual if you do it right . She told me that you often don't see a difference between homeschooled and public schooled students in the younger grades.
