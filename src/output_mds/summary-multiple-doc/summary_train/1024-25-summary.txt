Media Awareness Network, an organisation devoted to promoting media literacy, has developed tools to help teachers, parents and youth to better tackle the issue of cyber bullying. According to a Media Awareness Network study of 5,200 Canadian students, in Grades 4 to 11, cyber bullying is not an isolated phenomenon. The workshop offers strategies for librarians, teachers and parents on how to help young people develop responsible online behaviour and to strike a balance between freedom of expression and creating an environment in which children and youth are free from harassment.
