Both Bishop Ingham and Mr Hennessey were at the forefront of last year's fight against the NSW Labor Government's plan to introduce ethics classes as an alternative to the 100-year-old system of weekly 30 minute classes in Special Religious Education (SRE) which were offered as optional to students, but regarded by many parents as extremely important. They said it was surprising the Teachers' Federation did not object to the trial of ethics classes, as it would infer that Government schools are ethical vacuums. Now there has been a new push by various small interest groups to have such classes axed in favor of a completely secular school system so that any religion is taught as an academic subject and taught across the board as "world religions" rather than focusing on one faith, or on the doctrine of that faith.
