At this point, I don't think that you have much of a choice except to take a break from potty training. During your potty training break, you might read some books about potty training, so that you can find a method that you think will work better for the both of you. Since children at this age often like to imitate other children, it might also be helpful to try a preschool or mother's day out type program now, so that she can use the potty when all of the other kids do.
