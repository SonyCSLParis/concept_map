Attendance at PMS Parents Club board meetings is a great way to stay connected with the PMS community and learn about issues facing PMS students. They are very interested in supporting all parents in every way they can so please don't be shy about approaching any of them. As you know, the funds are the mainstay of our Parent Club budgets and essential for programs at all the schools.
