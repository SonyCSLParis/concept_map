Homeschooling Legal Issues The legal requirements for homeschooling vary from state to state and can change from year to year. If you would like to read the actual state statutes or code for you state, please visit the NHEN State Legal &amp; Legislative Information page .Reading the actual code can be valuable, but often it requires interpretation. Included with each of our state &amp; legal information pages are links to interpretations provided by groups located in each state.
