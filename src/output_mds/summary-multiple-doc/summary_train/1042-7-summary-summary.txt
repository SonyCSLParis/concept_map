Paynter spoke as the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund released a new report on how Texas public schools teach about the Bible. The TFN Education Fund used the Texas Public Information Act to survey the state's more than 1,000 public school districts for the report. The new report is based on instructional materials obtained from the 25 school districts that acknowledged offering a Bible course in the 2005-06 school year.
