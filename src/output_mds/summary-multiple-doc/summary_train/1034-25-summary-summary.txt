It's about programming. I enjoy designing and programming games and animations with other kids, because different people have different skills, and when you work together, you can build a much better project than you can alone... What I really like about Scratch is the way it's possible for young kids to create interesting projects, but it's also complex enough that even adults who know many other programming languages still enjoy participating. - Scratch member, age 17 "Using a set of about 100 commands that can be snapped together visually, you can create just about anything and learn the fundamentals of more advanced languages.
