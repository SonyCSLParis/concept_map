The initiative groups usually begin study groups for adults, and after a few years start a playgroup for children. At this point, it will be necessary for the initiative to join the Association of Waldorf Schools as a New Initiative Member, a step that will put the initiative in wider contact with the Waldorf movement. That is for each community interested in Waldorf Education to raise money to send one or two of its own members for training, to return to take on the task of working with an experienced teacher in founding the grade school.
