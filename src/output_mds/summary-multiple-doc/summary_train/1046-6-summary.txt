With the Ministry of Education's support, New Zealand schools are set up to give the community a say in deciding how their school works. You're encouraged to have a close relationship with your son or daughter's school and help support their learning at home. Get to know who is on your school's board of trustees (they have regular meetings and must listen to what parents want).
