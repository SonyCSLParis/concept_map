What is impossible, because the numbers posted demonstrate that is wrong, college acceptance is at a higher % for homeschoolers in the top tier institutions, and many posters have stated from personal experience your though here is wrong. Public schooling is at the bottom of the list and between my wife and myself both are probably more qualified to teach than alot of teachers in the public school. If you look at the numbers it would actually disagree with your assumptions.
