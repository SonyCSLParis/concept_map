Waldorf class teachers meditate on each of their students every night, and parents are often surprised to find that a teacher understands their child as well or better than they do. It is easier, then, for a Waldorf teacher to work with a class of 25 than it might be for a teacher in another school who typically has the same students for only one year. This means that Waldorf children participate in activities such as singing or acting or math games or juggling that they may not have chosen to do on their own.
