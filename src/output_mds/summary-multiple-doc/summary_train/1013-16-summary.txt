"Redshirting" - holding your child back from starting Kindergarten a year (or even two) - is the latest fad in so-called early education trends. Because, of course, it's easier for schools to have older, more developed children in their Kindergarten classrooms. They also worry about the younger children in the classroom who now have to fend for themselves with classmates who can be a whole year - or more - older than they are.
