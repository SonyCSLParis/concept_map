The best way to develop healthy sleeping habits is to have a good bedtime routine and to put your child into their crib while they are drowsy, but still awake, with conditions that they can re-establish for themselves if they wake up in the middle of the night. If your baby has not learned the proper sleep associations by the time he is five to six months old and he is waking up one or more times during the night, there are ways to help your child learn to sleep through the night. If she does get up and comes out, quickly return her to her room and remind her that she has to sleep in her own bed.
