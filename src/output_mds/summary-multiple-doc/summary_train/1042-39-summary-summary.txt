Legal experts for the left-leaning Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the right-leaning Rutherford Institute said Muslim students whose religion requires prayer at certain times of the day should be excused to pray in an empty room at that time, as long as students of all religious beliefs have similar options. "It's accommodating one religion in lieu of all the others," she said of Muslim prayer. One woman posting on a Facebook page about the issue said students are "not even allowed to say God in school," which is also not true, according to federal Department of Education guidelines.
