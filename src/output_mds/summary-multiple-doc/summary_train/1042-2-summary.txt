They included: how parents become aware of and involved in the planned integrated school movement; the range of motives which parents put forward for choosing an integrated school for their children and an attempt to categorise these motives and to assess their relative importance; what parents hope will be the outcomes for themselves, their children and the wider community; what levels of commitment in terms of time and resources are required, and how these vary between the different schools, between individuals and for specific individuals over time; what aspects of the organisation and running of the schools parents feel most concerned to be involved in and why they regard these as legitimate areas of parental concern; how parents see the relationship between themselves and the teaching staff of the schools, including whether they are conscious of actual or possible areas of tension or difficulty; the reasons why teachers choose to move into the integrated school sector, including the relative importance of positive factors like the perceived attractiveness of the new schools, and negative factors like dissatisfaction with the types of schools in which they previously worked; how teachers see their roles and responsibilities, and the extent to which they are aware of differences from the patterns which obtain in other schools which they have experienced; how teachers see their career patterns developing as a result of their move into integrated schools and their views about the possibility of returning to other sectors; the relationship of parents and teachers connected with the planned integrated schools to other official bodies such as central and local government departments, the churches and the teaching unions. Some parents had moved because they felt a general dissatisfaction with the existing schools; amongst the views expressed were that the schools in Northern Ireland were too formal, that they did not provide an education with enough emphasis on the child, and that because of this formality it was difficult for parents to talk to teachers or to discuss their concerns. Some of those early pioneers are averse to any suggestion that there is an integrated schools 'movement' for them there are just individual integrated schools which may have no more in common with one another than they have with any other schools in Northern Ireland.
