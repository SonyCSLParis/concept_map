I think it's really possible for us to say to every young person in America, for the first time in the history of this country if you will work hard and make your grades and you want to go to college, money should now not keep you from going. So today I came here, first, to listen to the concerns of the people that I introduced over there, who were trying to speak in a way for all of you, and, second, to tell you where I think we're going with this. What I want to do is to say, look, what's past is past, but what we want to do is to do all the things necessary to stop advertising and marketing tobacco to kids; to do things that will actually reduce teen smoking so more of you will live longer, better, healthier lives; and to do it in a way that protects the tobacco farmers in the communities -- and again I say, doesn't put the tobacco companies out of business, just gets them out of the business of selling to children.
