ORIENTATION FOR PARENTS Thursday, October 13, 2011, 7:00 PM WALLACE HALL Church of St. Ignatius Loyola Park Avenue at 84th Street All new parents are required to attend the orientation meeting to learn more about our goals, visions and expectations for the 2011-12 year, to meet the staff and administrators and to share with the other parents involved in IREP. If this is not possible, please call before the class begins so that we will not need to worry unnecessarily about the whereabouts of your child. A security person will be in attendance at the entrance to St. Joseph and St. Ignatius Loyola Grammar Schools beginning at 4:00 pm and lasting until the end of classes on Mondays (for St. Joseph's), and Tuesdays and Wednesdays (for St. Ignatius).
