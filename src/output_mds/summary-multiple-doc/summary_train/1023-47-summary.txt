Teaching proactively with bullying means that we teach our children early and often how to be kind, how to identify bullying, and how to deal with it. As we do this we should include descriptions of all types of bullying, including verbal and cyber bullying. Cline and Fay suggest one of the most valuable things we can do for a child who is bullied is to teach her that, "teasing doesn't mean there is something wrong with him or her, but it's a problem the other child has" (302).
