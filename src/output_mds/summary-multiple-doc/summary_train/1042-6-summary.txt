The groupings are: the old middle class; the new middle class; the Catholic middle class; the cosmopolitan middle class; the first generation middle class; the self-made middle class; and the marginal middle class. These values were strong factors in leading some parents to select less prestigious Catholic and other religious schools, or to seek a place in the selective government high schools. With so much invested in the choice of their schooling, what a burden it must be to live up to all this expectation, particularly if the chosen school turns out not to be right for them, even if it is right on the market indicators.
