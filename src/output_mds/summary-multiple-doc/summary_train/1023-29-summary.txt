If your child is a victim of bullying, try helping him with the following strategies: •      Listen carefully to your child's reports of being bullied. What can - and should - parents expect the school to do? •      School personnel should be informed about the children who are being victimized by bullies so they can monitor and provide support to the victims as needed.
