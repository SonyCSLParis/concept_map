Division F) I have been very worried about which school to put my boy in and I am really happy I chose your school. Johnathan has  been home schooled till now and has never been to any school before.He has not been exposed to the outside world and it was very important for me to pick the perfect school that would help  mould him become a well rounded, responsible individual. I thought it was indeed time to pen this letter and express my gratitude for the hard work and efforts that you and your teachers put in each day.
