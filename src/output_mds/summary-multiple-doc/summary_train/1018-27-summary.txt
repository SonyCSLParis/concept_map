In theory, these loans are used to fill the gap between available federal aid, and what students and families can afford to pay out-of-pocket for college costs. Loan Rates, Fees, and Limits Private loan terms and conditions, including interest rates and fees, are generally based on your credit history or a co-signer's credit history. If you take out a private loan, you will not be eligible for the same types of discharge, deferment and forbearance options that are available for federal loans.
