This was not who I was. A complaint on the teachers & maybe the school itself please let me know, i have almost 2 days before i meet with this principle " "Well i have to agree with the post of 10/7/2009, what was suppose to be a new beginning for my daughter in High School as a Freshman and to worry about being new at this school and trying to figure out what classes or clubs you want to join and stressing not to get lost in school but know that your best friends and other familiar faces will be there for you has turned into a Nightmare. I kept questioning her everyday how it went anything i ever got was 'ok' 'good' After a month like this i had enough and called one mother in particular who of course i had befriended and asked her if she knew what was going on, she had no idea what i was talking about, and didn't want to get involved all she said where the exact same words i have been reading in the newspapers 'kids are kids and girls are cruel no biggy' i was very hurt that since it was not her daughter going thru this she didn't really care.
