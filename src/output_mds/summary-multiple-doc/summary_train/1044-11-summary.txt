All I can say is my father was always thin and my mother wasn't and I am a male and over weight so... I did not keep it off however and at that point and at that age I do take full responsibility for that and I am not blaming either of my parents for my weight. although you are right parenting is not the only factor, but as a parent i am the biggest part of my childrens life and i am in control of what my childrens eating habits are This is very true and I see this in my own kids.
