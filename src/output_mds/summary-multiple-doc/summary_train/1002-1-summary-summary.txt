: If you're going to fuss over the fact that you do not own a cell phone or that your parents will not even consider it until high school, then CLEARLY you're not mature enough to have one of you're own either..." " i think the right age is 11 and older" "i think that these phones are only good for little kids ages 6-10 around there.this would not work on teens" "There is no ACTUAL set time when you should get your kid a cell phone. I think it's good to get a kid a cell phone because I'm at school from 6am to 4pm and I get out of school at 3pm actually so I wait an hour for my driver. This completley and utterly sucks..." "Well here is my thought on the kid cell phone thing I persanly think that kids should not have cell phones until they are like 15 or 16 years old I mean I got my first phone when I was 14 but now I am 16 but whatevar I mean if like if u really think that your kid is responsible enofe to have say am iPhone get them something like an iPod touch first then see how good the treat it (FYI that's what my dad did with me and now I have an iPhone 3GS) but yea the only reasen I would not get a tween or early teen (13-14) a phone is that with this generation of teens they act very Braty and arageny all because they have phones another reasen y I don't think that you g teens should have phones is that if they have a boy or girl friend they might just send them some inapropreit (like jailbait) things if the phone has a camera I'm just sayen but yea " "I want one too, gettin' one this Christmas & I'm 12:)" "so at what age should children get cell phones it doesnt say" "I'm turning 12 yrs old in 3 weeks and I get all A+s and I've NEVER had anything lower.
