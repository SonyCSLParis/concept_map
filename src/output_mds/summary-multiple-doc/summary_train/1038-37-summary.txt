And the fears children have about school can be very real: they may be apprehensive about separating from their parents, riding the school bus, or meeting a new teacher. Remind your child that this is a new year and express your confidence that he or she will behave better now that they're a year older. He did pretty good with pre-school, but he will be in a new school where he does not know anyone.
