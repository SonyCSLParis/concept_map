Fisher explained, â€œThere is a dominant culture of â€˜this is how you do computer science,â€™ and if you do not fit that image, that shakes confidence and interest in continuing.â€ According to Margolis and Fisher (2002, p. 72), â€œA critical part of attracting more girls and women in computer science is providing multiple ways to â€˜be inâ€™ computer science.â€ In other words, at least 75% of male CS undergraduates had parents who were affluent enough to be able to afford computers at a time when computers were very expensive. The reason I'm here is because I'm interested in the subject, I just think the reasons that there are few women in CS are many and diverse, but that privilege is just not one of them. When you look at any particular computer geek, you don't know what combination of interest and privilege got them to where they are.
