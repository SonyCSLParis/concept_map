My intended point amidst this discussion of contrasting legal systems is that even though the Mexican legal system differs in a FUNDAMENTAL way from that of the United States on the basis of an assumption of innocence or guilt, as a theoretical system it is SUPERIOR to that found in many if not most of our U.S. schools when it comes to situations like student fighting. I think one of the common refrains we hear from defendants of the "status quo" of school discipline systems would be, "These are policies for school, not for the real world outside of schools. The other issue which this situation points to is whether or not public school attendance should be mandatory in the United States in the twenty-first century.
