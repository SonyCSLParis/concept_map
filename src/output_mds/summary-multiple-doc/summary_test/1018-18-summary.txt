With the Stafford Loan, the loan is subsidized which means that the United States Federal Government will pay off the interest on the loan until you graduate College. There are also unsubsidized Stafford Loans but the student would be responsible for the loan and the interest as soon as the loan is paid out. There are Graduated Payments that start off with a lower rate and then increase over the years these loans are to be repaid from 12 to 30 years.
