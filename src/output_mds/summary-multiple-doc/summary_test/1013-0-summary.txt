Their parents choose to opt for homeschooling for a number of reasons - it could be that they're not happy with the schools in their area, that their children wasn't happy at school, that their child has a disability or learning problem that they feel they could handle better if educated at home, or that they simply feel their child would benefit from a more individual form of education. The Pros Of Homeschooling There are a variety of benefits with the homeschooling approach: Children can benefit from getting more attention to their own learning when they're taught alone, or in small groups (some homeschooling families join together for learning). Being at home doesn't mean children can't take GCSE exams - there are many options open to homeschoolers (e.g. doing them via distance learning education providers or through a local college) and one benefit is that they may well be able to do exams at an earlier stage than if at school.
