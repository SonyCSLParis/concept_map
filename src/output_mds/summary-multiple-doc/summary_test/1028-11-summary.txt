I don't even have prescriptions in my home so I never even thought about those drugs.Remember, you can't be a buddy right now to your teens, we have to be a parent. Comment By : Pattilou22 I am definitely for drug and alcohol testing in schools.These kids are to out of control so now its time to take away some of there privileges.Some kids are feared for retaliation.Parents try to watch out for their future as not to get a record and then they may not be able to get a job, then we have them home all the time.its a vicious cycle. Comment By : cat all these situations are so in par with my son's who just turned 16 what is a parent to do, I do not believe prison to be aplace to help it only covers the situation but the abuse is still there, my son is currently in detention and I am hoping to get him some councilling I know we will fight me everystep of the way.
