Their definition of a gifted child may not describe your child, or your child's educational needs may not fit in their school. A good school for gifted children isn't the school with a canned gifted program. However, in some Waldorf schools a child who reads earlier than third grade may feel out-of-place, or the school may assume that the parents "forced" the child to read, and attempt to "undo" it.
