- Maya Angelou Thanks to private donations and grant funding, the library's "Preschool Play Area" has been greatly enhanced by the addition of a new kid-friendly Early Literacy computer workstation and a wall-mounted flat-panel HDTV to help motivate one- through five-year-olds to visit the library often, to learn to read, and to learn that reading is fun. The main purpose of the HDTV is to play multimedia stories continuously during all hours that the library is open to the public. NOW SHOWING on the Early Literacy HDTV Here are most of the programs now being shown on the HDTV for early learners: Growing Readers: Teaching Your Preschooler to Love Reading (Excerpts from Growing Readers , a video produced by the Kansas City, Kansas Public Library) The TumbleBook Library is a collection of TumbleBooks (animated, talking picture books) TumblePuzzles, and TumbleQuizzes, as well as TumbleResources for teachers.
