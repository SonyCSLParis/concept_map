on April 17, 2012 A University of British Columbia researcher has developed a two-question test for parents to screen kindergarten-aged children for future anxiety disorders, the most commonly reported mental health concern among children. The two questions found to be effective in identifying anxiety disorders in children are: Is your child more shy or anxious than other children his or her age? "The good news is that anxiety disorders are among the easiest to treat and the best way to treat these disorders is when kids start school," she said.
