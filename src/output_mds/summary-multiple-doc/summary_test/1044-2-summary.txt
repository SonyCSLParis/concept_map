Dr McCoy said many parents can be in denial about their child's weight problem and a body mass index chart can help illustrate the fact. ''You do have to strip away that judgmental attitude towards obesity and look beyond that to bring it back to the child's health,'' he said. ''Often you hear parents say, 'I'm too busy to cook, it's easier to buy takeaway,' and so on, but once they realise they are affecting their children's health, they'll do anything to help.''
