When you build a network with other parents and get them involved in school, you can do even more for the school and the kids. Work with the teacher to set up a volunteer schedule that works for him or her and then call all the parents in the classroom - even if they didn't sign up to volunteer. - You don't have to be on the Board of these organizations to help.
