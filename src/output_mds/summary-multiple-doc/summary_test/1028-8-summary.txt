Recognizing the very important role that family plays in the development and decision making of students, it is important for parents/guardians to prepare their children for the inevitable opportunity to use alcohol or drugs. If your child is in a situation where they need your support, children need to know that they can count on you to come and get them, no questions asked. It is always important for parents to know where their children and teenagers are, who they are with, and to monitor their activities.
