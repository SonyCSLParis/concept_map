Research on the current state of the art in assessment and diagnosis of depression in children and adolescents suggests that assessment tools are available to adequately screen individuals at high risk for depression and assess the presence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Universal preventive interventions for depression, targeting all youth regardless of their level of risk, do not have the same evidence base as selective and indicated approaches; however, these prevention approaches may provide important opportunities for decreasing population levels of depression, because they would potentially impact a broader number of individuals across the risk spectrum. Opportunities for Further Development and Testing of Prevention Models Basic research Basic research presents opportunities for furthering what is known about the etiology of depression and comorbid disorders as well as opportunities for developing novel interventions, and improving the targeting and timing of preventive interventions.
