Posts Tagged 'obesity' Children who are given an "active" video game-one that requires that they move their body to play-are not likely to be more active in general than children who do not play active video games, a new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found. [Dr. Melissa] Gilliam, [board president of the Society of Family Planning], conducted a small study measuring how well Implanon - a three-year implant inserted beneath the skin of the arm - works in obese women; she found that blood levels of etonogestrel, released by the implant to prevent ovulation, were markedly lower in obese women compared to women who weren't overweight. Obese women may, though, want to speak to their doctors about the research findings to see whether they should take a birth control pill continuously or whether they should switch to an implant or intrauterine device to avoid having the dip in hormone levels.
