An Interview with Dr. Tracy Cross: The Social and Emotional Needs of Gifted Children "I first learned about this strange, new, 'gifted world' through SENG, and it was at a SENG conference that I first met people who felt like me, people who seemed to understand me and with whom I connected in a whole, new way." What have you found to be the top complaints of the gifted kids that you have worked with? I was very proud because my wife was there in addition to the School of Education faculty.
