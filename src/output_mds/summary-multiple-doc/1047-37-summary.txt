Special Services Programs: Provide current information about support groups and meetings to families, assist with and promote awareness of legislative issues relating to special education, conduct educational workshops for parents about services and strategies related to special services, raise awareness among all students, parents, and staff about the needs, talents and uniqueness of all children, encourage students, parents and community members to mentor children, and work within the community to encourage businesses to provide employment opportunities for children receiving special services. Created and partially-funded by the Georgia Department of Education's Division for Exceptional Students, the 62 Parent Mentors are moms and dads hired by local school systems to work with special education directors, parents, school teams, teachers and the community. In addition, a parent of a child with a disability leads the parent mentor effort at the GaDOE and is partnered with a staff education consultant.
