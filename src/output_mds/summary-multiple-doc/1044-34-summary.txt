It's important to identify risk factors because they may provide a way to alter the child's environment and reduce the chance of becoming overweight,  Agras said. Attributes and behaviors were assessed until the child was 5 years old and were then used to predict whether the child would be overweight at 9.5 years. The researchers found that 25 percent of the children were in the 85th percentile of BMI at 9.5 years of age, including 9 percent that were in the 95th percentile.
