The basic course presented by the manual is designed to be used in a 60 hour training program and includes also introduction and "training for trainers" sections which are not a part of the basic course but are intended to be read as an introduction to the program as a whole and which provide information on the nature of the training program and practical clues as to how to structure the program. The author suggests a number of questions to the reader to discuss the larger issues and to be a problem solver as well as to test your possible solutions and to investigate the further issues. The students are learning conflict resolution in the classroom.
