These questions, along with important implications about the roles of teachers, were addressed by Krishnamurti in 1984 in a statement made at a school in Ojai, California, based on his teachings: It is becoming more and more important in a world that is destructive and degenerating that there should be a place, an oasis, where one can learn a way of living that is whole, sane and intelligent. These are primarily private schools, but some are public; as school choice expands, more and more Montessori charter schools will likely appear as well. See John P. Miller, The Holistic Curriculum .
