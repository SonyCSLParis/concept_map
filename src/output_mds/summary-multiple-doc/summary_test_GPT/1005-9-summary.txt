Three-Year-Old Acting Out I have a 3-year-old and a 2-year old who are exact opposites. It's hard for me to get her to eat and all she seems to want to do is watch TV. In addition to negative consequences like timeouts, enforce positive consequences like making your daughter "redo" her bad behavior in the appropriate manner.
