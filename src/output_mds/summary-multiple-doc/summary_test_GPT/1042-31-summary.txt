EARLY DISMISSAL If a student will need to leave school early, please contact the Religious School office in advance by phone or email or send your child to school with a note. The Parents Association is the forum for parents to work with the clergy and the staff of the Department of Lifelong Learning to plan, publicize and run activities for synagogue families of Religious School age. If you do not wish for Congregation Emanu-El to use photographs of your child on our website or in our publicity, then please indicate this on your registration form or contact the Religious School Office .
