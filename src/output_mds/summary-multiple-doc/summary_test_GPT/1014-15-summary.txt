Those who oppose the adoption of youth anti-possession measures also believe that such measures will 1) deflect the attention of law enforcement personnel from lawbreaking merchants who sell tobacco to minors and misdirect it at kids; 2) reduce merchant compliance with the law; 3) create a climate of disrespect for the law (as such measures are not likely to be stringently enforced); 4) increase the allure of tobacco by making it even more forbidden and dangerous than it now seems and creating an even more intransigent counterculture of rule-breaking teens. Due to the fact that many people who are concerned about youth smoking feel they cannot wait until research proves or disproves the efficacy of criminalizing youth possession as a deterrent to teen smoking, however, it is my intent to provide them with the information needed to make as informed a decision about this issue as possible by summarizing and discussing 1) what is known about criminalization of youth possession of tobacco and its effect on teen tobacco use; 2) the parameters of the youth possession problem, and the logic of the arguments for and against the adoption of youth anti-possession measures; 3) alternatives and adjuncts to criminalization of youth possession; and 4) how to fit youth anti-possession measures into a comprehensive approach to tobacco control so that local policy makers can make as informed a decision about this issue as possible.
