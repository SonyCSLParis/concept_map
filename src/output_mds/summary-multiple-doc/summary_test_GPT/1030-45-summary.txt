Based upon the extant literature, this study will test the following four primary hypotheses: • Because there are few requirements guiding the creation of school substance use and gambling policies, the content and clarity of these policies will be heterogeneous across schools and modes of policy distribution (e.g., handbooks vs. school Web sites); • College alcohol policies currently devote relatively little attention to student recovery; • Due to differences in enforcement, awareness of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, educational programs and types of students, schools with either no or only restrictive alcohol use policies will experience higher levels of binge drinking among students than schools with prohibitive and recovery-oriented alcohol policies; • Absent a federal mandate that requires gambling-related regulations or education on college campuses, gambling policies will be less prevalent than alcohol use policies. "Low Agreement" Policy Variables, Mentioned Inconsistently in School Handbooks and Web Materials (N = 28) Identifying the Underlying Dimensions of College Policy As noted earlier, the coding process revealed that all 117 colleges (i.e., 100% of the schools for which information was available) in this sample had a written policy on student alcohol consumption, but only 26 (22%) had a published policy that addressed gambling. Policy, Binge Drinking and Gambling The analysis of policy variables and binge drinking rates revealed a variety of relationships among policy variables and student drinking behaviors.
