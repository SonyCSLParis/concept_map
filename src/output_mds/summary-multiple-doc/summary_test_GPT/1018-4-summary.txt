If you are a minor, or new to the country, or simply do not have a credit history, here is where you start. One way to do this without a credit card is to have someone co-sign a loan for you. This will help you get a loan you may otherwise not be eligible for, and if you pay your debt well, and in time, you can build a great credit history.
