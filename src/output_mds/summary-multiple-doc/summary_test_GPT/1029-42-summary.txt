This makes for an interesting dynamic when one or more of their parents also has a substance abuse problem. The kids may have enough treatment to have figured out that although they had a drug or alcohol problem, it's pretty clear that one or both of their parents are also drug or alcohol addicted and there comes a time in the kids' treatment when they really want to confront mom or dad about their use, but to do so puts them at risk for making mom or dad even more angry than they already are, and puts the kid at risk for being stuck in the program for a longer time (or so the kid might think). Kids can maintain their sobriety and their sanity, even if their parents keep using, if they go to meetings, call friends and sponsors, volunteer for recovery events, read recovery literature, hang out with sober friends and their sober parents, and steer clear of their parents when they're using as much as possible without getting into trouble for being away from home too much.
