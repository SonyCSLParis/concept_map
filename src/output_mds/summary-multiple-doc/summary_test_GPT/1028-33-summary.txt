Parent involvement is systematically increased with the schools, with the youth, with their own family, and with the families of other youth at the same school. They are invited to bring their whole busy family for a multi-family group opportunity which respects their role as parent leader in their own family, and offers them a chance to build relationships with other parents of children attending their child's school. The parents who "need it the most", and who "do not care about their child" are the very same parents who must not care enough about the child to come in and find out what they can do to improve their child's situation.
