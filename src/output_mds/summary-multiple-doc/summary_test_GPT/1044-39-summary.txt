Controlling, perfectionist, overindulgent, and avoidant parenting styles create frustration in the parents and will bring little peace in the home. They tell children what to do, they try to make them obey and they usually do not provide children with choices or options. Children with controlling parents turn out to have less social competence because the parent generally tells the child what to do instead of allowing the child to choose by him or herself.If the demands are pushed too forcefully upon the child, the child will break down, or rebel, or want to get away from home, taking the earliest opportunity to escape such as a love marriage or a course in a college in another city.
