The reason kids who train at age 2 have more of these problems than children who train later, in my opinion, is that they have spent more months or years deciding for themselves when they should pee or poop - before they're mature enough to understand the importance of eliminating as soon as they feel the urge. What about the children who are potty trained early and don't have problems? My little girl has been wanting to go to the potty to makes a "poop" as you say and always gets very anxious about it but does go after a few minutes (although not always) I have noticed that she is constipated and sometimes it is painful for her so I can only think she is holding it in and getting constipated.
