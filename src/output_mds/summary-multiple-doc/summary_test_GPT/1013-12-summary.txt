Montessori Programs in Public Schools John Chattin-McNichols Characteristics of Elementary Montessori Classes Montessori classes are made up of children in a three-year age range: preschools have 3- and 4-year-olds and kindergartners; elementary classes have first, second, and third graders, and so on. Montessori Programs in Public Schools A survey conducted by the author in 1981 collected data from 25 of the approximately 50 school districts known to have Montessori programs at the time (Chattin-McNichols, 1981). For More Information One source of up-to-date information on public school Montessori programs is the Montessori Public School Handbook 1991, which comes from a new resource group called the Montessori Public Schools Consortium.
