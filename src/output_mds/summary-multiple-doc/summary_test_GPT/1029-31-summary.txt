Now, I would not tell an 8-year-old about my drug use, but when my kids were 14 or 15 and we had these discussions, I knew that their friends were starting to experiment with this, and I wanted to be able to give them better advice about it than they'd get from their friends. I wouldn't just talk about marijuana, either -- there are a lot of drugs and chemicals out there (I still remember being told as a college freshman that huffing air duster was way safer than smoking pot...yeah, riiiight) and most of them will mess you up, so it's better to skip the whole experience. I didn't like smoking that much when I was a teenager, so my stories are not glorifying it.
