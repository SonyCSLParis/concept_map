The following questions and answers can help you to get the most out of talking to your child's teacher or with other school staff members. Schools have a responsibility to keep you informed about your child's performance and behavior and you have a right to be upset if you don't find out until report-card time that your child is having difficulties. Before the meeting, plan what you are going to say why you think a rule is unfair or what exactly you don't like about an assignment.
