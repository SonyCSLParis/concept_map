As young people surf the Net in ever-increasing numbers-from schools, libraries and their homes-the risk of them accidentally encountering hate material grows-as does the issue of how to shield them from undesirable online content. Filtering Software One technical solution often recommended for protecting children is filtering software. And, of course, filtering software isn't particularly selective: if a parent programs it to block all references to "hate" or "Holocaust," for example, the software will certainly screen out most hate Web sites-but it will also block access to valuable and legitimate resources such as sites dedicated to anti-racism, Jewish culture, war museums, and even discussions of anti-hate legislation.
