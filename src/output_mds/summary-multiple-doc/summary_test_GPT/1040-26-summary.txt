On the Road with "Exploring Learning Disabilities" by Alex Baez and Carol Speigl As certified Bridges to Practice trainers, we have been "on the road" across Texas since 2001, sharing our continually evolving knowledge about adults with learning disabilities, first using LINCS 's standardized Bridges to Practice Training about adults with learning disabilities, and more recently with the training that we developed, "Exploring Learning Disabilities: Why Is It So Difficult for Some Students to Learn?" This process is covered in more depth in the "Exploring Learning Disabilities" presentation. The Role of Adult Education Programs Adult education programs, in addition to making sure their instructors are knowledgeable about the characteristics of and best teaching practices for students with learning disabilities, will need to put in place screening processes for students who may be "at risk" for having a learning disability, to determine who may need further testing.
