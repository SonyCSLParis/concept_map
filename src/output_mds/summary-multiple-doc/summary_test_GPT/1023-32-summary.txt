In 2004 staff and parents identified that students who were bullied didn't have effective strategies to deal with the bullying and teachers didn't have specific resources to use in addressing the issue. To address the feedback we decided to use a program called Friendly Schools and Families which was designed by Edith Cowan University. The main indicator of success has been an increase of reporting by students and parents of bullying.
