It said a study of 5,000 15-year-olds looked at their exposure to smoking on screen, and whether or not they had tried smoking. The researchers say that previous research from other countries has shown that smoking attitudes and the behaviour of adolescents is influenced by smoking seen in films, but it is unclear whether this association applies to adolescents in the UK. The study also had some limitations: As a cross-sectional study, the study cannot establish cause and effect, so it cannot say that viewing films where characters smoked caused teenagers to start smoking.
