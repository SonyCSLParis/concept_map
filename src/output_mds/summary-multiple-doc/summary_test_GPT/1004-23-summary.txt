ADHD as a Predictor of Depression As indicated in Table 3 and Figure 1 A, the Cox model revealed that children and adolescents with ADHD in year 1 (ages 4-6 years) were at greater risk for depression across assessment years 6 (ages 9-11 years) through 14 (ages 17-18 years) than comparison children and adolescents, even controlling for sex, intelligence, and the significant predictor of maternal depression. Survival probabilities for (A) the diagnosis of major depression and/or dysthymia and (B) suicide attempts during assessment years 6 through 14 (spanning 9-18 years of age) among 125 children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in year 1 and 123 comparison children and adolescents. As shown in Figure 3 A, among the 125 children with ADHD in wave 1, Cox modeling revealed that girls with ADHD were at greater risk for depression than boys with ADHD during assessment years 6 through 14 ( 2  = 3.97, P  &lt; .05; hazard ratio, 1.96).
