The teacher asked her what religion she was, and she told her. The 1995 Education Department guidelines state: "Public schools may not provide religious instruction, but they may teach about religion, including the Bible or other scripture: the history of religion, comparative religion, the Bible (or other scripture)-as-literature, and the role of religion in the history of the United States and other countries all are permissible public school subjects. Even if religion has not been raised, always discuss your religion with your attorney if you are involved in a child custody case.
