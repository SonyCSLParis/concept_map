Class hadn't begun yet, so I sat down, turned it on, and flipped to the first page of the manual. I didn't have to ask permission if I could write a program (though teachers didn't want us playing games during school hours, of course, or getting in fights if more than one person wanted to play with the computer). Yes, I made a lot of amateurish mistakes and annoyed my parents by using the family TV when I could have been outside riding my bike or playing with the neighbor kids.
