I have a 17 year old daughter, I have never spied on her and never drilled her about where she was etc., and she feels free to talk to me when she needs to about her life and she always calls me from where she is to let me know, is always home on time and always lets me know who she is with. my son used pot and we did have the police talk to him and have a counselor talk to him but i can't say with absolute certainly that he is not using now, i have decided not to continue to be hyper vigilant going through his room, checking his phone..it was absolutely making me crazy but i am trusting in God and praying every day that he make good choices and i tell that to the kid, that i am counting on him and trusting that he makes the right choice..oh how i wish i could roll back the hands of time too..but courageously we must face tomorrow and trust that what we have poured into to them will come out of them.
