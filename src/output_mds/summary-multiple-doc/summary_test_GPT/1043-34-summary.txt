Research reported in the Journal of Family Psychology followed young children and their families in order to see what aspects of their home lives influenced children's early literacy development (Serpell et al 2002). Middle-income parents, for example, were much more likely than low-income parents to report that they made a priority of reading with their children. A bright spot in this story is the Imagination Library / Shelby County Books from Birth program, which helps to influence the culture of family literacy, and is helping to build a culture of reading with young children in Memphis and Shelby County.
