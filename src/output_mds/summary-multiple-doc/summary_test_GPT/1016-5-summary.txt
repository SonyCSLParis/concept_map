So if you do wish you could change your little one's sleep habits, take a look first at what you are doing now, and then think about how you could do that differently, which may result in a different outcome. If you are sleep training and your baby is becoming very upset, this is a very good technique to use so that when you go back into your baby's room, or if you are sitting in the room with him, you can stay calm and loving. My four year old doesn't always nap in the day now, but he has a rest at the same time after lunch, and if he needs a sleep, he'll dose off.
