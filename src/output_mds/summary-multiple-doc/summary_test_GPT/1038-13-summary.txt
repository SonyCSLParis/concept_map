Chat to your child about school Be chatty and positive about the start of school, and encourage your child to talk about it if he's anxious. A get-together in the park in the weeks leading up to the new term is a great way to establish a few friendships - for you as well as your child. Bring bedtime forward to a sensible time, if you need to, and start setting the alarm for an early start if you don't already.
