It would be hard to say how many Montessori schools there are (and the question of whether or not a school can be called a "Montessori" school is sometimes a difficult one, since there is no legal protection on the name, and any school may call itself "Montessori"), but Montessori Connections lists 4361 US schools and 1595 international schools in its database . Although most people know the method by the name of the man who invented it, Suzuki himself called it Talent Education, and many of the institutions around the world bear this name. For some comments on these, go to my article on Suzuki &amp; Montessori Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) opened the first "Steiner" school in 1919, in Stuttgart, Germany.
