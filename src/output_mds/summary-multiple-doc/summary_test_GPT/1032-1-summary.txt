Though these encounters tend to be difficult for the child, this separation anxiety - as it is called, is but a normal part of a child's growth and development. At age 5 months, these infants show anxiety when a stranger is present or when a different person other than their primary caregiver gives care. Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder in children that is distinguished by extreme distress and hysterical fits whenever a child is separated from a primary caregiver, may it be a parent, relative or nanny.
