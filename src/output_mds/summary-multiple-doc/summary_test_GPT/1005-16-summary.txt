I don't think I would relax the rules like this if Rebecca were acting up, but she's a very responsible girl, and I don't have a lot of concerns. So when your 4-year-old is screaming because she's bored for the entire four hours, please do not ignore her, because it is very hard for the rest of us on the plane to sleep/read/watch a movie/refrain from hitting you over the head when you don't seem to realize how disturbing your child is. And when you say it, and she doesn't listen, and you don't do anything, it increases the chances that one of the other passengers will lose it and just come back there and hit you on the head, which is what I know the big guy sitting beside me was contemplating (I had ear plugs, but I still heard the whole thing).
