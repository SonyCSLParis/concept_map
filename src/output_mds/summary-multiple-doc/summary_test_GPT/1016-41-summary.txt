Things parents can do The following are some strategies that may assist parents to more effectively manage their child's sleep problems: Support your child to maintain a generally healthy diet and minimise unhealthy eating habits Encourage your child to exercise regularly and spend time outdoors Be aware of any discomfort, pain, or signs of illnesses Check the suitability of the child's bed as this will change with age Make sure that the room temperature is just right to promote sleep Try to minimise noise levels during sleep time Encourage a regular sleep routine Take safety precautions if your child 'sleep-walks' Use sleep medication only when prescribed by a doctor If you suspect that your child's sleep problem is serious, take them to a doctor or a specialist for proper diagnosis and treatment Things to remember Parents whose child experiences sleep problems eagerly wait for the time when their child is finally able to sleep through the night without any difficulty. For example, it is typical for a two month-old baby to wake up several times during the night yet have no problems at falling back to sleep Wetting the bed at night is another common problem for parents with young children. It is common for young children to master daytime toilet training first before they can manage to stay dry during sleep [17] When parents or teachers have concerns about a child's school performance and/or behaviours, sleep problems may be an issue.
