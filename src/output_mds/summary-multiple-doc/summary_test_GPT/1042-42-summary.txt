We would be grateful if parents would wait at the upper end of the playground (near the fence) for the children at the end of the day If you are going to be late for any reason please inform us as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements until your arrival. Health and Safety Access to the school car park is restricted and, for reasons of safety, cars cannot get in or out between 8.45am - 9.15am and 3.15pm and 3.45pm, thus ensuring the safe arrival at and departure from the school premises at each end of the day Jewellery must not be worn as it can present a safety risk. Where future changes in the arrangements could be foreseen they have been mentioned in the brochure but it cannot be assumed that there will be no further changes before the start of, or during, the school year 2007/08, or in relation to subsequent school years.
