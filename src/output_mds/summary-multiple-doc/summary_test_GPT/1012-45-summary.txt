However, for me....a hug and kiss and "I love you momma," is the best paycheck at the end of the day.....That and "Honey, I'm home", top with the dog making it through the day without getting peanut butter on him...and maybe the couch and kids too so it wasn't a bad idea but just something up till now we hadn't really thought about it to a large extent. Proverbs 3:5,"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding" I drill moms who home school and basically said, don't tell me just the benefits, but the pitfalls I had to watch for and prepare....talk to me like they wanted to talk me out of homeschooling so I could see where my heart really lay and if this is the path that God was calling us to take. 8 comments I know you will be a great homeschooling mom (and dad) and I feel so confident about this for you and the kids.
