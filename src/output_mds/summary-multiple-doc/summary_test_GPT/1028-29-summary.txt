Dr. Jacobson described the effects of low-level lead exposure and prenatal alcohol exposure on 7-year-old children. This has been a problem with other disorders, such as ADHD, but may be a particular concern with fetal alcohol exposure since many children who present with behavioral problems are adopted and their parents may not know the extent of their alcohol exposure. Whether polydrug use during pregnancy and multiple exposures have summative or synergistic effects The degree to which FAS subgroup phenotypes of cognitive behavioral profiles (subtypes) might exist within the set of all alcohol-exposed individuals, profiles that might help target laboratory research and assist in the design of intervention studies Clear communication that subtypes may not be specific to alcohol Relating the size of the corpus callosum to subtype differentiation Differentiating deficits that result directly from brain damage (core or primary deficits) from effects that result from environmental influences Comparing children of alcoholics who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol with those who have not Developing the knowledge base regarding the experiential component of developmental psychopathology Developing the knowledge base regarding the effects of postnatal experience on brain development Comparisons of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol to those prenatally exposed to cocaine (although essentially the same populations, they experience very different neurobehavioral outcomes) Comparing conduct disorders in children prenatally exposed to alcohol with conduct disorders in children not prenatally exposed to alcohol Development of possible interventions, including drugs, to counteract the effects of alcohol in pregnant women and to affect the injured neurotransmitter systems of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol.
