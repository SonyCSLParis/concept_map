As late as November, 1835, the Texans declared in convention that â€œthey will continue faithful to the Mexican Government as long as that nation is governed by the constitution and laws that were formed for the government of the political associates.â€  When Santa Anna and the other military chieftains overthrew the federal constitution of Mexico and dissolved the social compact which existed between Texas and other members of the Mexican Confederacy, the Texans declared that â€œthey were no longer morally or politically bound by the compact of the union * * * yet they offered their support and assistance to such members of the Mexican Confederacy as will take up arms against military despotism.â€            For years the leaders among the colonists had advised patience and forbearance, hoping that a peaceful solution of the troubles arising could be reached without resorting to war. And even then there were those among the delegates to this convention who were hopeful that a permanent separation from Mexico might be averted, and contented themselves by having the convention to declare that â€œthey hold it to be right, during the disorganization of the Federal System and the reign of despotism, to withdraw from the Union and establish an independent government or adopt such measures as they may deem best calculated to protect their rights and liberties.â€            As an indication that the leaders in that convention believed it still possible to avoid a permanent separation from Mexico, a proposition to at once adopt a declaration of independence was voted down, and they organized a provisional State Government and elected a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative Council. This, the Texans claimed, was only a temporary arrangement, and in their convention in 1833 they memorialized the Mexican government to give Texas a separate state government, setting out that the Constitution of 1824 guaranteed to Texas the right of having a state government whenever she may be in a condition to ask for the same, referring to the language of the Constitution which read: â€œAs soon as Texas shall be in condition to figure as a state of itself, it shall inform Congress thereof.â€            The Convention of 1833 adopted a Constitution for the Sate and elected Stephen F. Austin, Dr. John B. Miller and Erasmo Seguin, commissioners to present the memorial and constitution to the Government at the City of Mexico and ask for the ratification of the State constitution.
