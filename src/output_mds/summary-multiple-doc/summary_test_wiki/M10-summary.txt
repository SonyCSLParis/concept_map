At this time Moses Austin was on his way to San Antonio to apply for a grant of land and permission to settle 300 families in Texas. Ignoring the facts that the empresario could not claim the grant until he had settled at least 200 families and that he could hardly sell land when every married man could obtain 4,600 acres free, the settlers appealed to the political chief at San Antonio for an opinion, and he ruled that Austin could not collect. The Law of April 6, 1830, embodied the Mexican policy of stopping the further colonization of Texas by settlers from the United States.
