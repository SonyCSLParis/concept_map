Irredentist forces from Mexico try to take back Texas On this day in 1842, Mexican general Adri√°n Woll, with a force of 12,000 men, captured the city of San Antonio. In 1836 Woll was quartermaster general of Santa Anna's army in the invasion of Texas. No further contact was made with the retreating Mexicans until Woll was overtaken at the crossing of the Hondo River by Hays's company, riding half a mile in advance of Caldwell's main army.
