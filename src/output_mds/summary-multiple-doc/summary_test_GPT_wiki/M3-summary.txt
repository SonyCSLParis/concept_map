It was the battle over the proposed “Bricker Amendment” to the United States Constitution. One later version, the so-called George Amendment, provided that “[a] provision of a treaty or other international agreement which conflicts with this Constitution shall not be of any force or effect,” and that “[a]n international agreement other than a treaty shall become effective as internal law in the United States only by an act of the Congress.” Regrettably, the Bricker Amendment’s failure left in doubt the questionable nexus between the UN treaty and the American Constitution. On an institutional level, we learn about a blind eye to the Rwanda and Darfur genocide; about insidious subversion of America’s educational system; about a scheme to tax our citizens to support the organization’s world government goals; about UNESCO’s drive to “re-orient the moral compass of the planet” economically, politically, intellectually, and esthetically; about presidential approval of international control over some of our nation’s most important landmarks; about the threat to private property rights through environmental strategies; about the control of procreation in the name of resource conservation; about the internationalization of natural resources; about open borders; about the potentially devastating surrender of American jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court; and, in the end, about a world army commanded by UN Secretariat bureaucrats (who will have first disarmed all American citizens)—no doubt with troops from such countries as Syria, Iran, China, North Korea, Zaire, Uganda, Venezuela, and Cuba.
