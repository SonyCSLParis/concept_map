[Other] "I am the RCMP School Liaison for this school and feel this would be a great program for the school" [School Staff] "please join...it will help make our school a better place." [Parent] "I think all schools should be apart of this including the Catholic schools it will give students, staff and parents a safe place to report bullying even if you think it doesn't happen at your school it does, and if your school district truly believes in the zero tolerance for bullying than sign up if you don't then we'll know where you really stand on the subject!" [Parent] "my child was bullied in jk by a 10 year old from the same school and it took me 3 months to find out anything about it even knowing to the day when it happened &amp; the school denying anything and protecting the bully's rights..and it took 9 months for my child to get back on the bus...we need to make a difference, get educated and teach our children to open up about what happens at school, learn to trust their teachers and parents to not be afraid to tell, teach parents how to approach the problem so 'we' can help the best way we can..." [Parent] "This is a good way show the kids that the school will take bullying and the safety of the victim seriously."
