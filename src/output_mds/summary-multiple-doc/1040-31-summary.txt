About Our Course- ADVANCE DIPLOMA IN LEARNING DISABILITY For four years, Specialist courses on learning disabilities have been established with focus on advanced training. Where occupational therapists tend to have substantial knowledge and skills to deal with a number of developmental disorders, Learning Disabilities, on the contrary, is one such area where their talent has not been tapped, which of course, could have added a new dimension to the innovative field of occupational therapy.
