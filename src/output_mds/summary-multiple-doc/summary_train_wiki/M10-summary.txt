Study Site This research study focused on one site in Indonesia. Furthermore, all domestic tourists that took part in the study were part of some form of tour group. It is important to remember that Borobudur is not only a source of income to the state and provincial governments, but also provides income to the local people both in the immediate area and those in the city of Yogyakarta close by.
