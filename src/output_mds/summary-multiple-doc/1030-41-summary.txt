Corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 22 states, according to court papers filed on behalf of the charter school, the School of Excellence in Education. You probably should have filed your complain in state court where your case wouldn't turn on the question of whether it was a violation of federal rights (which in fact, it was). LAST THOUGHT: the school had no more legal power to hold her down and beat her when she expressed desire to vacate the premises than it would have had to visit her home or grab her on the street and beat her.
