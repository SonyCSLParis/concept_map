Most young students have little or no credit history, so the interest rates of school loans are usually basic prime rates. When it comes to paying the loan off, the great thing about student loan payments is that they are often on a sliding time scale or are deferred for a number of years. It can be really difficult to make loan payments while trying to study and take care of classes.Almost any further educational programs can be covered by student financial aid.
