If parents don't stick to the rules and consequences they set up, their kids aren't likely to either. Consistency is the key to effective discipline, and it's important for parents to decide (together, if you are not a single parent) what the rules are and then uphold them. Don't let down your guard now - discipline is just as important for teens as it is for younger kids.
