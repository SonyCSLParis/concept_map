Kids will benefit from knowing they are not alone in their addiction, and from being with other kids who are going through the same struggle to overcome computer game addiction. They will learn how to get back into being a kid in the real world, and to find a balance between playing on the computer and other activities in their lives. The group is facilitated by Dr. Hilarie Cash, a co-founder of Internet/Computer Addiction Services, and Anna DiNoto, who is currently studying for her doctorate in clinical psychology with a focus in video game/Internet addiction at Argosy University in Seattle, Washington.
