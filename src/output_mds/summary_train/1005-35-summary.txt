My Homeschool Schedule Here is our schedule : 7:00 We are all up... 7:30 We get ready for the day and eat breakfast. I only have five, so I know that our house isn't up to the activity level that this one is, but I can say that it is necessary for me to have a schedule to make sure no one gets left out and the subjects get covered. I found that when we are going along, a few of my children like to linger and just assume that we can "get to it tomorrow."
