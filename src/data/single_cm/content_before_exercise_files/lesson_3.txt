Building Molecules from Atoms


Grade Level


Prospective and practicing K-8 Teachers; may be adapted for use in elementary
classrooms.



Time


Exercises 1-4 take approximately 1 hour.




In the previous two laboratory sessions, we learned that the atoms and
molecules being investigated
were all around us. In this lab, we are going to begin an exploration of
how atoms interact with each other to form molecules. Observations of both
different atoms and different molecule formations will be made. In the footsteps
of many scientists before us, we will use model building as a technique
to make these observations and to discover how these atoms come together
to form bonds and create molecules.



To Ponder

1.
How many substances
have you come into contact with in your lives (for example, wood, steel,
plastic, nylon, Teflon, leaf, skin, fingernail, beak, claw, hair, cotton,
paper, wool, rayon, cardboard, glue, paste, flour, sugar, salt, pepper)?
Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? Millions?

2.
Every substance has its own unique properties,
making it different from other substances. How can we understand the many
different properties in the many substances we know?

3.
Is it really true that all substances are made of just
109 different kinds of atoms? How can there possibly be
so many different kinds of substances when there are so few kinds of atoms?

4.
Do atoms retain their individual properties when they are joined together
to form molecules?

5.
Do all molecules of the same type have the same properties?

6.
How do the organic molecules
characteristic of living things differ from inorganic molecules?

Objectives


Once you have completed these exercises you should be able to:

1.
Understand how molecules form and break apart in living things.

2.
Describe the effects of one, two and three bonds on the rotation of atoms.

3.
Recognize that forming a bond requires and captures energy, while breaking
a bond releases energy.



Background


Molecules
Atoms are basic building blocks that can combine with one another in
an enormous variety of patterns. They link together in regular ways to form
molecules



Powerful Idea


A molecule by definition contains more than one atom(e.g. H2 - hydrogen
gas, N2 - nitrogen gas, O2 - oxygen gas, H2O - water, CO2.- carbon dioxide
gas). Molecules may contain one or more kinds of atoms and may be solids,
liquids, or gases at room temperature. Billions of the same kind of molecules
together form a homogeneous substance such as water or
absolute alcohol. A homogeneous substance is one that contains the same
molecules or atoms throughout. Living cells are so small that we typically
view them with powerful magnifying devices such as light and electron microscopes.
Yet a single living cell contains billions of atoms and molecules. How can
scientists study anything that is this tiny?
It is NOT possible to 'see' small molecules like water or sugar by any
available means. In fact, only recently has it become possible to 'see'
large macromolecules
like DNA with electron and scanning electron microscopes. Yet the philosopher
Democritus (384-322 BC) first proposed the idea of atoms several hundred
years before Christ was born. And John Dalton (1766-1844) produced the basic
postulates of the atomic theory two centuries ago. The theory is based upon
many sound lines of evidence largely involving:
 

looking at many molecules together,
  looking indirectly at the effects and behaviors of molecules,
  looking at models of molecules, and
  making predictions based upon the theory and testing them in the laboratory.

In this lab, we will use the modeling approach.



Exercise 1


Molecular Structure


Background

1.
Some molecules consists of two or more atoms held together by covalent chemical
bonds. Covalent Bonds are formed when two atoms share a
pair of electrons between them. They are strong bonds that serve to hold
atoms tightly together in molecules.




a.
One covalent bond is formed by one pair of shared electrons, one electron
from one atom and the other electron from the other atom. In water, for
example, there are two single covalent bonds.
Figure 1. Water





b.
A pair of atoms may form more than one covalent bond between them, as
in O2 or O=O.
Figure 2. Oxygen





c.
The number of covalent bonds formed by a particular small atom is usually
equal to the number of electrons it needs to fill its outer orbital. Thus
hydrogen forms one bond, oxygen forms two bonds, and carbon forms four bonds.

Question


d.
How many covalent bonds are in each of the following molecules?


oxygen gas, O2 
__________

water, H2O
__________

carbon dioxide, CO2

To Do


e.

oxygen gas

water

Question


f.
Where is the biologically usable energy stored in a molecule?



Exercise 2


Modeling Molecules
Use the molecular model kit in order to help you visualize how molecules
are put together and what they look like.

To Do

1.
Familiarize yourself with the modeling kit. Open the box and sort the pieces
into similar piles.



2.
The roundish plastic pieces with holes in them represent various types of
atoms. Each color represents a different element. The gray links represent
covalent bonds. Check the list under Supplies (p.
1) to make sure that you have all the necessary pieces.

Question

3.
Examine one of the white hydrogen atoms. How many holes (bonding points)
does it have? __________



4.
How many holes (bonding points) are in the black carbon atoms? __________



5.
How many holes (bonding points) are in the red oxygen atoms? __________



6.
How many holes (bonding points) are in the blue nitrogen atoms? __________

Explain

7.
Do these structures correspond to your expectations based on the last
lab? Explain.




Background

8.
The short links are to be used when bonding two atoms together with one
covalent bond. The long links are to be used when bonding the same two atoms
together with 2 or 3 covalent bonds.



9.
A carbon atom is very versatile and can bond to another carbon atom with
a single, double, or triple bond. To see how, take out 6 black carbon atoms
and connect them in pairs as follows:

To Do


a.
connect one pair of carbon atoms together with one covalent bond (use
one short gray link)
Model 1: Carbon -
carbon single bond


To Do


b.
connect the second pair together with two covalent bonds (use two long
gray links)
Model 2: Carbon -
carbon double bond


To Do


c.
connect the third pair together with three covalent bonds
Model 3: Carbon -
carbon triple bond


Question

10.
For each bonded pair, try rotating the atoms around their bonds and also
wiggling the atoms with respect to each other. What happens?




Explain

11.
Which arrangement, 1, 2, or 3 shared covalent bonds, places the least
constraint on the free motion of atoms? 
Explain.




Question

12.
Which arrangement, 1, 2, or 3 shared covalent bonds, places the greatest
constraint on the free motion of atoms?






13.
The greater the constraints on free motion, the less stable
the bond and the more likely it will break. Which of these situations, 1)
a single bond, 2) a double bond), or 3) a triple bond produces the most
constrained, least stable, most reactive molecule?





To Do

14.
Make a model of hydrogen gas, H2. It consists of two hydrogen
atoms connected by a single covalent bond. Take two hydrogen atoms and connect
them together with a short link.
Model 4: Hydrogen
gas


Question

What does the link between the two atoms represent? Describe in terms
of the structure of the atoms and their shared parts.




Explain


b.
Could you connect more than two hydrogen atoms together? Explain, again
in terms of the structure of the atoms and their shared parts, why or why
not.




To Do

15.
Another simple molecule is oxygen gas, O2. To model oxygen,
take two oxygen atoms and covalently bond them together in such a manner
that nothing else could be attached to either atom.
Model 5: Oxygen gas


Question


a.
How many covalent bonds are required to connect two oxygen atoms together?




b.
What is this number of covalent bonds between two atoms called?

Describe


c.
Describe these bonds with diagrams.








Question


d.
How many electrons are being shared by the two atoms?



Exercise 3


Molecular Formulas


Background

1.
You may have already noticed the relationship between the number of atoms
in a molecule and their representation in the molecular formula. Molecules
of both hydrogen and oxygen gas have two atoms. Their formulas are H2
and O2. The H stands for hydrogen; the O for oxygen. The subscript
number in each formula tells how many of each particular type of atom are
in the molecule, 2 hydrogens in hydrogen gas and 2 oxygens in oxygen gas.

Question

2.
The molecular formula for water is H2O. What atoms make up
water and how many of each are there?





3.
Water is an inorganic molecule. What is the basis of this classification?



To Do

4.
Construct a model of water. Obtain one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms
and connect them together. Draw what it looks like in the space below. Note
that the bonding angle is larger than 90o









Question

5.
The molecular formula for methane gas is CH4.What atoms make
up methane gas and how many of each are there? Methane gas is an organic
molecule. Why is it so classified? Where does it occur?









To Do

6.
Construct a model of methane. Draw your model of methane below.











Exercise 4


Types of Bonds


Describe

1.
To review what you learned above, describe how covalent bonds are formed
and where they occur.







2.
Electrons are shared equally in a covalent bond joining two atoms of the same element.  Name three molecules in which this is the case.




Background

3.
In polar molecules like water, however, the electrons are not shared equally between the atoms
because oxygen is highly electronegative. Electronegativity
is a measure of the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons
to itself. Because oxygen is highly electronegative, the shared electrons
in the covalent bonds are much more attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen.
Because of this, the oxygen takes on a partial
negative charge while the hydrogens take on partial positive charges. These
partial charges are indicated with the delta symbol (). This polarity makes water molecules
behave like little magnets and accounts for many of the unusual properties
of water.
Figure 3. Water molecule


To Do

4.
On the sketch of the water molecule above, show the partial positive
and partial negative charges.



5.
As we noted previously, these partial charges make water molecules behave
like little magnets, with the (negative) oxygen of one water molecule attracting
the (positive) hydrogen of another water molecule. The attraction between
atoms in different molecules due to partial charges in this case is called
a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen
Bonds are very weak bonds because the atoms are attracted to each
other by only partial, not full, charges. Hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than covalent bonds - they are readily broken and readily formed anew because
no electrons are actually shared. Use dotted lines to draw the hydrogen
bonds that might occur among half a dozen water molecules.

To Do

6.
Make models of several water molecules and lay them out on your table to
demonstrate their hydrogen bonding interactions, using 'dotted' toothpicks
to represent hydrogen bonds. The three atoms, H - O ---H,
usually lie in a straight line. Show your instructor the arrangement.

Describe

7.
Hydrogen bonding among water molecules gives rise to many of the interesting
qualities of water we studied earlier. Although each individual hydrogen
bond is weak and easily broken, the large number of hydrogen bonds in a
substance such as water has a strong cumulative effect. Describe how hydrogen
bonding among water molecules accounts for each of the phenomena
below.




a.
cohesion









b.
high specific heat






Describe

8.
Many organic molecules have partial charges on various atoms. This is true
of wood, paper products, and glass. Describe how hydrogen bonding between
water and other substances accounts for the phenomena below.




a.
adhesion









b.
capillary action
Note: On the other hand, there are many molecules that attract one another
and exhibit cohesiveness without hydrogen bonding such as mercury





Background

9.
A third type of bond is the ionic
bond which forms between two or more ions with opposite charges,
typically in salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), acids such as sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), and bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Rather than share a pair of electrons, an ionic bond is formed when one
atom gives one or more electrons to another atom. In NaCl, for
example, the sodium (which has just one electron in its outer orbit) gives
it electron to chlorine (which has 7 electrons in its outer orbit). In this
way, both atoms reach stable electron configurations.

Question


a.
What is the charge on the sodium ion which has lost an electron? Explain.









b.
What is the charge on the chloride ion which has accepted an electron?
Explain.









c.
What is the charge on the sodium chloride molecule? Explain.






To Do

10.
Ionic bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. In a dry sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal, the ions form a latticework
held together by ionic bonds. Draw the molecular structure of a salt crystal.






To Do

11.
Salt separates in solutions.
Water molecules pack around each ion, forming hydrogen bonds from their
partially charged areas to the ion's full charge. Different ends of the
water molecule are attracted to positive and negative ions. Draw salt ions
in solution below, showing the water and hydrogen bonds.






Background

12.
Hydrogen bonds also play a role in the folding of and in maintaining
the shape of large molecules such as DNA, because weak hydrogen bonds form
between different partially charged areas of the molecule.
Figure 4. Section of DNA molecule
showing hydrogen bonding between nucleotides at different points in the
DNA strands.


Background

13.
Water is but one of many polar molecules. In fact, any time OXYGEN or NITROGEN
is involved (for example, in carbohydrates or proteins or DNA), the molecules
are likely to be polar due to the strong attraction of electrons by these
two electronegative elements. This polarity helps to make
many different molecules water soluble.

Powerful Ideas


14.
Summary. There are more than 12 million substances on earth,
made from various combinations of approximately 100 different kinds of atoms.
The postulates of Dalton's theory still apply today:




a.
All matter is made of atoms.




b.
All atoms of a given element are identical, both in mass and in properties
[except for isotopes]. Atoms of different elements have different masses
and different properties.




c.
Compounds [molecules] are formed by combination of two or more different
atoms which combine in whole numbers (e.g., 1 atom of A, two atoms of B,
and four atoms of C).




d.
Atoms are the units of chemical change. A chemical
reaction involves combination, separation or rearrangement
of atoms. Atoms are NOT created, destroyed, divided into parts, or converted
into other kinds of atoms during a chemical reaction.



15.
Living things are filled with dynamic, ongoing chemical reactions. Consider
the large scale reactions described below and classify them as combination
(combining atoms to build larger molecules), separation
(breaking molecules down into smaller subunits), or rearrangement
(changing the bonds between atoms within a molecule).

Chapter 4: THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D: Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 1 of 7)
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly
through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different
from atoms of other elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules
or may be packed together in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms
into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 3 of 7)
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means
greater average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated.
In solids, the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate.
In liquids, the atoms or molecules have higher energy, are more loosely
connected, and can slide past one another; some molecules may get enough
energy to escape into a gas. In gases, the atoms or molecules have still
more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 6 of 7)
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly
reactive metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as
chlorine, fluorine, and oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive
gases (such as helium and neon). An especially important kind of reaction
between substances involves combination of oxygen with something else as
in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the categories;
among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.

Types of Bonds


Describe

1.
To review what you learned above, describe how covalent bonds are formed
and where they occur.







2.
Electrons are shared equally in a covalent bond joining two atoms of the same element.  Name three molecules in which this is the case.




Background

In polar molecules like water, however, the electrons are not shared equally between the atoms
because oxygen is highly electronegative. Electronegativity
is a measure of the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons
to itself. Because oxygen is highly electronegative, the shared electrons

and partial negative charges.

As we noted previously, these partial charges make water molecules behave
like little magnets, with the (negative) oxygen of one water molecule attracting
the (positive) hydrogen of another water molecule. The attraction between
atoms in different molecules due to partial charges in this case is called
a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen

Background

9.
A third type of bond is the ionic
bond which forms between two or more ions with opposite charges,
typically in salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), acids such as sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), and bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Rather than share a pair of electrons, an ionic bond is formed when one
atom gives one or more electrons to another atom. In NaCl, for
example, the sodium (which has just one electron in its outer orbit) gives
it electron to chlorine (which has 7 electrons in its outer orbit). In this
way, both atoms reach stable electron configurations.

What is the charge on the sodium ion which has lost an electron? Explain.









b.
What is the charge on the chloride ion which has accepted an electron?
Explain.









c.
What is the charge on the sodium chloride molecule? Explain.






To Do

10.
Ionic bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. In a dry sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal, the ions form a latticework
held together by ionic bonds. Draw the molecular structure of a salt crystal.






To Do

11.
Salt separates in solutions.
Water molecules pack around each ion, forming hydrogen bonds from their
partially charged areas to the ion's full charge. Different ends of the
water molecule are attracted to positive and negative ions. Draw salt ions
in solution below, showing the water and hydrogen bonds.






Background

12.
Hydrogen bonds also play a role in the folding of and in maintaining
the shape of large molecules such as DNA, because weak hydrogen bonds form
between different partially charged areas of the molecule.
Figure 4. Section of DNA molecule
showing hydrogen bonding between nucleotides at different points in the
DNA strands.


Background

13.
Water is but one of many polar molecules. In fact, any time OXYGEN or NITROGEN
is involved (for example, in carbohydrates or proteins or DNA), the molecules
are likely to be polar due to the strong attraction of electrons by these
two electronegative elements. This polarity helps to make
many different molecules water soluble.

Powerful Ideas


14.
Summary. There are more than 12 million substances on earth,
made from various combinations of approximately 100 different kinds of atoms.
The postulates of Dalton's theory still apply today:




a.
All matter is made of atoms.




b.
All atoms of a given element are identical, both in mass and in properties
[except for isotopes]. Atoms of different elements have different masses
and different properties.




c.
Compounds [molecules] are formed by combination of two or more different
atoms which combine in whole numbers (e.g., 1 atom of A, two atoms of B,
and four atoms of C).




d.
Atoms are the units of chemical change. A chemical
reaction involves combination, separation or rearrangement
of atoms. Atoms are NOT created, destroyed, divided into parts, or converted
into other kinds of atoms during a chemical reaction.



15.
Living things are filled with dynamic, ongoing chemical reactions. Consider
the large scale reactions described below and classify them as combination
(combining atoms to build larger molecules), separation
(breaking molecules down into smaller subunits), or rearrangement
(changing the bonds between atoms within a molecule).

Chapter 4: THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D: Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 1 of 7)
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly
through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different
from atoms of other elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules
or may be packed together in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms
into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 3 of 7)
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means
greater average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated.
In solids, the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate.
In liquids, the atoms or molecules have higher energy, are more loosely
connected, and can slide past one another; some molecules may get enough
energy to escape into a gas. In gases, the atoms or molecules have still
more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 6 of 7)
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly
reactive metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as
chlorine, fluorine, and oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive
gases (such as helium and neon). An especially important kind of reaction
between substances involves combination of oxygen with something else as
in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the categories;
among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.



























Building Molecules from Atoms


Grade Level


Prospective and practicing K-8 Teachers; may be adapted for use in elementary
classrooms.



Time


Exercises 1-4 take approximately 1 hour.




In the previous two laboratory sessions, we learned that the atoms and
molecules being investigated
were all around us. In this lab, we are going to begin an exploration of
how atoms interact with each other to form molecules. Observations of both
different atoms and different molecule formations will be made. In the footsteps
of many scientists before us, we will use model building as a technique
to make these observations and to discover how these atoms come together
to form bonds and create molecules.



To Ponder

1.
How many substances
have you come into contact with in your lives (for example, wood, steel,
plastic, nylon, Teflon, leaf, skin, fingernail, beak, claw, hair, cotton,
paper, wool, rayon, cardboard, glue, paste, flour, sugar, salt, pepper)?
Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? Millions?

2.
Every substance has its own unique properties,
making it different from other substances. How can we understand the many
different properties in the many substances we know?

3.
Is it really true that all substances are made of just
109 different kinds of atoms? How can there possibly be
so many different kinds of substances when there are so few kinds of atoms?

4.
Do atoms retain their individual properties when they are joined together
to form molecules?

5.
Do all molecules of the same type have the same properties?

6.
How do the organic molecules
characteristic of living things differ from inorganic molecules?

Metal Connectors

Objectives


Once you have completed these exercises you should be able to:

1.
Understand how molecules form and break apart in living things.

2.
Describe the effects of one, two and three bonds on the rotation of atoms.

3.
Recognize that forming a bond requires and captures energy, while breaking
a bond releases energy.



Background


Molecules
Atoms are basic building blocks that can combine with one another in
an enormous variety of patterns. They link together in regular ways to form
molecules



Powerful Idea


A molecule by definition contains more than one atom(e.g. H2 - hydrogen
gas, N2 - nitrogen gas, O2 - oxygen gas, H2O - water, CO2.- carbon dioxide
gas). Molecules may contain one or more kinds of atoms and may be solids,
liquids, or gases at room temperature. Billions of the same kind of molecules
together form a homogeneous substance such as water or
absolute alcohol. A homogeneous substance is one that contains the same
molecules or atoms throughout. Living cells are so small that we typically
view them with powerful magnifying devices such as light and electron microscopes.
Yet a single living cell contains billions of atoms and molecules. How can
scientists study anything that is this tiny?
It is NOT possible to 'see' small molecules like water or sugar by any
available means. In fact, only recently has it become possible to 'see'
large macromolecules
like DNA with electron and scanning electron microscopes. Yet the philosopher
Democritus (384-322 BC) first proposed the idea of atoms several hundred
years before Christ was born. And John Dalton (1766-1844) produced the basic
postulates of the atomic theory two centuries ago. The theory is based upon
many sound lines of evidence largely involving:
 

looking at many molecules together,
  looking indirectly at the effects and behaviors of molecules,
  looking at models of molecules, and
  making predictions based upon the theory and testing them in the laboratory.

In this lab, we will use the modeling approach.



Exercise 1


Molecular Structure


Background

1.
Some molecules consists of two or more atoms held together by covalent chemical
bonds. Covalent Bonds are formed when two atoms share a
pair of electrons between them. They are strong bonds that serve to hold
atoms tightly together in molecules.




a.
One covalent bond is formed by one pair of shared electrons, one electron
from one atom and the other electron from the other atom. In water, for
example, there are two single covalent bonds.
Figure 1. Water





b.
A pair of atoms may form more than one covalent bond between them, as
in O2 or O=O.
Figure 2. Oxygen





c.
The number of covalent bonds formed by a particular small atom is usually
equal to the number of electrons it needs to fill its outer orbital. Thus
hydrogen forms one bond, oxygen forms two bonds, and carbon forms four bonds.

Question


d.

oxygen gas, O2 
__________

water, H2O
__________

carbon dioxide, CO2

Exercise 2


Modeling Molecules
Use the molecular model kit in order to help you visualize how molecules
are put together and what they look like.

To Do

1.
Familiarize yourself with the modeling kit. Open the box and sort the pieces
into similar piles.



2.
The roundish plastic pieces with holes in them represent various types of
atoms. Each color represents a different element. The gray links represent
covalent bonds. Check the list under Supplies (p.
1) to make sure that you have all the necessary pieces.

Question

3.

does it have? __________



4.
How many holes (bonding points) are in the black carbon atoms? __________



5.

6.
How many holes (bonding points) are in the blue nitrogen atoms? __________

Explain

7.
Do these structures correspond to your expectations based on the last
lab? Explain.




Background

8.
The short links are to be used when bonding two atoms together with one
covalent bond. The long links are to be used when bonding the same two atoms
together with 2 or 3 covalent bonds.



9.
A carbon atom is very versatile and can bond to another carbon atom with
a single, double, or triple bond. To see how, take out 6 black carbon atoms
and connect them in pairs as follows:

To Do


a.
connect one pair of carbon atoms together with one covalent bond (use
one short gray link)
Model 1: Carbon -
carbon single bond


To Do


b.
connect the second pair together with two covalent bonds (use two long
gray links)
Model 2: Carbon -
carbon double bond


To Do


c.
connect the third pair together with three covalent bonds
Model 3: Carbon -
carbon triple bond


Question

10.
For each bonded pair, try rotating the atoms around their bonds and also
wiggling the atoms with respect to each other. What happens?




Explain

11.
Which arrangement, 1, 2, or 3 shared covalent bonds, places the least
constraint on the free motion of atoms? 
Explain.




Question

12.
Which arrangement, 1, 2, or 3 shared covalent bonds, places the greatest
constraint on the free motion of atoms?






13.
The greater the constraints on free motion, the less stable
the bond and the more likely it will break. Which of these situations, 1)
a single bond, 2) a double bond), or 3) a triple bond produces the most
constrained, least stable, most reactive molecule?





To Do

14.
Make a model of hydrogen gas, H2. It consists of two hydrogen
atoms connected by a single covalent bond. Take two hydrogen atoms and connect
them together with a short link.
Model 4: Hydrogen
gas


Question


a.
What does the link between the two atoms represent? Describe in terms
of the structure of the atoms and their shared parts.




Explain


b.
Could you connect more than two hydrogen atoms together? Explain, again
in terms of the structure of the atoms and their shared parts, why or why
not.




To Do

15.
Another simple molecule is oxygen gas, O2. To model oxygen,
take two oxygen atoms and covalently bond them together in such a manner
that nothing else could be attached to either atom.
Model 5: Oxygen gas


Question


a.
How many covalent bonds are required to connect two oxygen atoms together?




b.
What is this number of covalent bonds between two atoms called?

Describe


c.
Describe these bonds with diagrams.








Question


d.
How many electrons are being shared by the two atoms?



Exercise 3


Molecular Formulas


Background

1.
You may have already noticed the relationship between the number of atoms
in a molecule and their representation in the molecular formula. Molecules
of both hydrogen and oxygen gas have two atoms. Their formulas are H2
and O2. The H stands for hydrogen; the O for oxygen. The subscript
number in each formula tells how many of each particular type of atom are
in the molecule, 2 hydrogens in hydrogen gas and 2 oxygens in oxygen gas.

Question

2.
The molecular formula for water is H2O. What atoms make up
water and how many of each are there?





3.
Water is an inorganic molecule. What is the basis of this classification?



To Do

4.
Construct a model of water. Obtain one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms
and connect them together. Draw what it looks like in the space below. Note
that the bonding angle is larger than 90o









Question

5.
The molecular formula for methane gas is CH4.What atoms make
up methane gas and how many of each are there? Methane gas is an organic
molecule. Why is it so classified? Where does it occur?









To Do

6.
Construct a model of methane. Draw your model of methane below.











Exercise 4


Types of Bonds


Describe

1.
To review what you learned above, describe how covalent bonds are formed
and where they occur.







2.
Electrons are shared equally in a covalent bond joining two atoms of the same element.  Name three molecules in which this is the case.




Background

3.
In polar molecules like water, however, the electrons are not shared equally between the atoms
because oxygen is highly electronegative. Electronegativity
is a measure of the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons
to itself. Because oxygen is highly electronegative, the shared electrons
in the covalent bonds are much more attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen.
Because of this, the oxygen takes on a partial
negative charge while the hydrogens take on partial positive charges. These
partial charges are indicated with the delta symbol (). This polarity makes water molecules
behave like little magnets and accounts for many of the unusual properties
of water.
Figure 3. Water molecule


To Do

4.
On the sketch of the water molecule above, show the partial positive
and partial negative charges.



5.
As we noted previously, these partial charges make water molecules behave
like little magnets, with the (negative) oxygen of one water molecule attracting
the (positive) hydrogen of another water molecule. The attraction between
atoms in different molecules due to partial charges in this case is called
a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen
Bonds are very weak bonds because the atoms are attracted to each
other by only partial, not full, charges. Hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than covalent bonds - they are readily broken and readily formed anew because
no electrons are actually shared. Use dotted lines to draw the hydrogen
bonds that might occur among half a dozen water molecules.

To Do

6.
Make models of several water molecules and lay them out on your table to
demonstrate their hydrogen bonding interactions, using 'dotted' toothpicks
to represent hydrogen bonds. The three atoms, H - O ---H,
usually lie in a straight line. Show your instructor the arrangement.

Describe

7.
Hydrogen bonding among water molecules gives rise to many of the interesting
qualities of water we studied earlier. Although each individual hydrogen
bond is weak and easily broken, the large number of hydrogen bonds in a
substance such as water has a strong cumulative effect. Describe how hydrogen
bonding among water molecules accounts for each of the phenomena
below.




a.
cohesion









b.
high specific heat






Describe

8.
Many organic molecules have partial charges on various atoms. This is true
of wood, paper products, and glass. Describe how hydrogen bonding between
water and other substances accounts for the phenomena below.




a.
adhesion









b.
capillary action
Note: On the other hand, there are many molecules that attract one another
and exhibit cohesiveness without hydrogen bonding such as mercury





Background

9.
A third type of bond is the ionic
bond which forms between two or more ions with opposite charges,
typically in salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), acids such as sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), and bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Rather than share a pair of electrons, an ionic bond is formed when one
atom gives one or more electrons to another atom. In NaCl, for
example, the sodium (which has just one electron in its outer orbit) gives
it electron to chlorine (which has 7 electrons in its outer orbit). In this
way, both atoms reach stable electron configurations.

Question


a.
What is the charge on the sodium ion which has lost an electron? Explain.









b.
What is the charge on the chloride ion which has accepted an electron?
Explain.









c.
What is the charge on the sodium chloride molecule? Explain.






To Do

10.
Ionic bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. In a dry sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal, the ions form a latticework
held together by ionic bonds. Draw the molecular structure of a salt crystal.






To Do

11.
Salt separates in solutions.
Water molecules pack around each ion, forming hydrogen bonds from their
partially charged areas to the ion's full charge. Different ends of the
water molecule are attracted to positive and negative ions. Draw salt ions
in solution below, showing the water and hydrogen bonds.






Background

12.
Hydrogen bonds also play a role in the folding of and in maintaining
the shape of large molecules such as DNA, because weak hydrogen bonds form
between different partially charged areas of the molecule.
Figure 4. Section of DNA molecule
showing hydrogen bonding between nucleotides at different points in the
DNA strands.

Water is but one of many polar molecules. In fact, any time OXYGEN or NITROGEN

are likely to be polar due to the strong attraction of electrons by these
two electronegative elements. This polarity helps to make

in a molecule and their representation in the molecular formula. Molecules
of both hydrogen and oxygen gas have two atoms. Their formulas are H2
and O2. The H stands for hydrogen; the O for oxygen. The subscript
number in each formula tells how many of each particular type of atom are
in the molecule, 2 hydrogens in hydrogen gas and 2 oxygens in oxygen gas.

Question

2.
The molecular formula for water is H2O. What atoms make up
water and how many of each are there?





3.
Water is an inorganic molecule. What is the basis of this classification?



To Do

4.

and connect them together. Draw what it looks like in the space below. Note
that the bonding angle is larger than 90o









Question

5.
The molecular formula for methane gas is CH4.What atoms make
up methane gas and how many of each are there? Methane gas is an organic
molecule. Why is it so classified? Where does it occur?









To Do

6.
Construct a model of methane. Draw your model of methane below.











Exercise 4


Types of Bonds


Describe

1.
To review what you learned above, describe how covalent bonds are formed
and where they occur.







2.
Electrons are shared equally in a covalent bond joining two atoms of the same element.  Name three molecules in which this is the case.




Background

3.
In polar molecules like water, however, the electrons are not shared equally between the atoms
because oxygen is highly electronegative. Electronegativity
is a measure of the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons
to itself. Because oxygen is highly electronegative, the shared electrons
in the covalent bonds are much more attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen.
Because of this, the oxygen takes on a partial
negative charge while the hydrogens take on partial positive charges. These
partial charges are indicated with the delta symbol (). This polarity makes water molecules
behave like little magnets and accounts for many of the unusual properties
of water.
Figure 3. Water molecule


To Do

4.
On the sketch of the water molecule above, show the partial positive
and partial negative charges.



5.
As we noted previously, these partial charges make water molecules behave
like little magnets, with the (negative) oxygen of one water molecule attracting
the (positive) hydrogen of another water molecule. The attraction between
atoms in different molecules due to partial charges in this case is called
a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen
Bonds are very weak bonds because the atoms are attracted to each
other by only partial, not full, charges. Hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than covalent bonds - they are readily broken and readily formed anew because
no electrons are actually shared. Use dotted lines to draw the hydrogen
bonds that might occur among half a dozen water molecules.

To Do

6.
Make models of several water molecules and lay them out on your table to
demonstrate their hydrogen bonding interactions, using 'dotted' toothpicks
to represent hydrogen bonds. The three atoms, H - O ---H,
usually lie in a straight line. Show your instructor the arrangement.

Describe

7.
Hydrogen bonding among water molecules gives rise to many of the interesting
qualities of water we studied earlier. Although each individual hydrogen
bond is weak and easily broken, the large number of hydrogen bonds in a
substance such as water has a strong cumulative effect. Describe how hydrogen
bonding among water molecules accounts for each of the phenomena
below.




a.
cohesion









b.
high specific heat






Describe

8.
Many organic molecules have partial charges on various atoms. This is true
of wood, paper products, and glass. Describe how hydrogen bonding between
water and other substances accounts for the phenomena below.




a.
adhesion









b.
capillary action
Note: On the other hand, there are many molecules that attract one another
and exhibit cohesiveness without hydrogen bonding such as mercury





Background

9.
A third type of bond is the ionic
bond which forms between two or more ions with opposite charges,
typically in salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), acids such as sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), and bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Rather than share a pair of electrons, an ionic bond is formed when one
atom gives one or more electrons to another atom. In NaCl, for
example, the sodium (which has just one electron in its outer orbit) gives
it electron to chlorine (which has 7 electrons in its outer orbit). In this
way, both atoms reach stable electron configurations.

Question


a.
What is the charge on the sodium ion which has lost an electron? Explain.









b.
What is the charge on the chloride ion which has accepted an electron?
Explain.









c.
What is the charge on the sodium chloride molecule? Explain.






To Do

10.
Ionic bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. In a dry sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal, the ions form a latticework
held together by ionic bonds. Draw the molecular structure of a salt crystal.






To Do

11.
Salt separates in solutions.
Water molecules pack around each ion, forming hydrogen bonds from their
partially charged areas to the ion's full charge. Different ends of the
water molecule are attracted to positive and negative ions. Draw salt ions
in solution below, showing the water and hydrogen bonds.






Background

12.
Hydrogen bonds also play a role in the folding of and in maintaining
the shape of large molecules such as DNA, because weak hydrogen bonds form
between different partially charged areas of the molecule.
Figure 4. Section of DNA molecule
showing hydrogen bonding between nucleotides at different points in the
DNA strands.


Background

13.
Water is but one of many polar molecules. In fact, any time OXYGEN or NITROGEN
is involved (for example, in carbohydrates or proteins or DNA), the molecules
are likely to be polar due to the strong attraction of electrons by these
two electronegative elements. This polarity helps to make
many different molecules water soluble.

Powerful Ideas


14.
Summary. There are more than 12 million substances on earth,
made from various combinations of approximately 100 different kinds of atoms.
The postulates of Dalton's theory still apply today:




a.
All matter is made of atoms.




b.
All atoms of a given element are identical, both in mass and in properties
[except for isotopes]. Atoms of different elements have different masses
and different properties.




c.
Compounds [molecules] are formed by combination of two or more different
atoms which combine in whole numbers (e.g., 1 atom of A, two atoms of B,
and four atoms of C).




d.
Atoms are the units of chemical change. A chemical
reaction involves combination, separation or rearrangement
of atoms. Atoms are NOT created, destroyed, divided into parts, or converted
into other kinds of atoms during a chemical reaction.



15.
Living things are filled with dynamic, ongoing chemical reactions. Consider
the large scale reactions described below and classify them as combination
(combining atoms to build larger molecules), separation
(breaking molecules down into smaller subunits), or rearrangement
(changing the bonds between atoms within a molecule).

Chapter 4: THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D: Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 1 of 7)
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly
through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different
from atoms of other elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules
or may be packed together in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms
into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 3 of 7)
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means
greater average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated.
In solids, the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate.
In liquids, the atoms or molecules have higher energy, are more loosely
connected, and can slide past one another; some molecules may get enough
energy to escape into a gas. In gases, the atoms or molecules have still
more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8 (Benchmark 6 of 7)
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly
reactive metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as
chlorine, fluorine, and oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive
gases (such as helium and neon). An especially important kind of reaction
between substances involves combination of oxygen with something else as
in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the categories;
among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.

Powerful Idea


A molecule by definition contains more than one atom(e.g. H2 - hydrogen
gas, N2 - nitrogen gas, O2 - oxygen gas, H2O - water, CO2.- carbon dioxide
gas). Molecules may contain one or more kinds of atoms and may be solids,
liquids, or gases at room temperature. Billions of the same kind of molecules
together form a homogeneous substance such as water or
absolute alcohol. A homogeneous substance is one that contains the same
molecules or atoms throughout. Living cells are so small that we typically
view them with powerful magnifying devices such as light and electron microscopes.
Yet a single living cell contains billions of atoms and molecules. How can
scientists study anything that is this tiny?
It is NOT possible to 'see' small molecules like water or sugar by any
available means. In fact, only recently has it become possible to 'see'
large macromolecules
like DNA with electron and scanning electron microscopes. Yet the philosopher
Democritus (384-322 BC) first proposed the idea of atoms several hundred
years before Christ was born. And John Dalton (1766-1844) produced the basic
postulates of the atomic theory two centuries ago. The theory is based upon
many sound lines of evidence largely involving:
 

looking at many molecules together,
  looking indirectly at the effects and behaviors of molecules,
  looking at models of molecules, and
  making predictions based upon the theory and testing them in the laboratory.

In this lab, we will use the modeling approach.Powerful Idea
