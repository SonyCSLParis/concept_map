Time


Exercises 1-3 take approximately 2 hours.

Until very recently, scientists believed that atoms were the smallest unit of matter which 
existed.  It was only by studying atoms, the stuff all matter is made of, that scientists 
came to be able to split the atom and "look" inside.
For the purpose of this lab, it will not be necessary to borrow a linear accelerator.  It 
will be necessary to begin to develop a basic understanding of atoms.  What are they?  What 
are some of the more common atoms?  Where do they exist in our bodies?
In a brief set of exercises, we will explore common atoms, the periodic table, and atomic 
structure.

To Ponder


1.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. How does matter get recycled?


2.
How can we eat many different kinds of animal and plants and use those materials to 
construct or our bodies?


3.
Plants don't eat as we do. How do they construct themselves?


4.
Why doesn't all the water on earth simply disappear through evaporation?

Periodic Table




Objectives


Once you have completed these exercises you should be able
to: 


1.
Understand what atoms are and what they are composed of.


2.
Describe how the components of an atom may vary.


3.
Identify the distinguishing structural features of an atom and how they affect the atom's properties.


4.
Read the periodic table of elements.


5.
Calculate the atomic weight of an atom,
given its atomic number. 




Background
Information


There are 109 known elements.  Oxygen, gold, and arsenic are examples of 
elements in the entire universe.  The smallest unit into which an element may be divided 
while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that element is an 
atom. Atoms are tiny, tiny invisible particles. All substances on earth are made of 
different combinations of the 109 elements.





Powerful Idea



An individual atom of gold has all the attributes of the substance, gold.  A gold atom, 
and in fact all atoms, are made up of smaller components called protons, neutrons, 
and electrons.  However, the subunits of an atom of gold do not, by themselves, have 
the properties of gold.  To restate a powerful idea, an atom is the smallest unit into 
which an element may be divided while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that 
element.
   

Many non-science majors are 'turned off by' or fearful of studying chemistry.  Who cares 
about invisible stuff?  Well, it happens that a little chemistry can be amazingly empowering 
in helping people to answer practical questions such as: 'How can I lose weight?'  
'What happens to a woman's body when she gets pregnant?'  'What happens to my body if I smoke 
or drink?  Thus, it will be rewarding if you keep your mind open and your curiosity peaked 
during this and subsequent labs.  If you do, you are liable to find it interesting!  
And relatively easy.  We only need to know the basic basics in this course.







A.Atoms are composed of three types 
of particles, the neutron, the proton, and the electron.



1.Each type of particle has a different charge.

A proton has an electrical charge of  +1.
An electron has an electrical charge of  -1.
A  neutron has no electrical charge associated with it.



2.Two of the three particles have significant mass.

A proton has a mass of 1 Atomic Mass Unit (AMU).
A neutron has a mass of 1 AMU.
An electron has negligible mass (zero for our purposes).
Note that atomic mass may be conventionally reported as numbers alone, without the AMU 
	designation.



3.Location: Two of the three particles are located in the atomic nucleus and the third 
orbits the nucleus.

Neutrons and protons are tightly packed into the middle of the atom, a region called the 
atomic nucleus (not to be confused with a cell nucleus!).
Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus in complex patterns or orbitals which are determined by 
how many electrons the particular atom has.



B.Most, but not all, atoms have equal numbers of protons, electrons and neutrons.




1.
The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is the primary determining factor 
for the general characteristics of the atom.  Each different element has a different number 
of protons in its atomic nucleus.  Atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic 
nucleus are the same element, regardless of whether they have the same numbers of neutrons or 
electrons.


2.For example, 
all atoms with 1 proton are hydrogen,
all atoms with 6 protons are carbon,
all atoms with 7 protons are nitrogen,
all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen,
regardless of the numbers of neutrons and electrons they may have associated with them.



3.Hydrogen is different from all other atoms in that the hydrogen atom normally does not 
contain a neutron.  That is,
the hydrogen atom is composed
of one proton and one
electron but
no neutron.



4.Isotopes are atoms of an element which have differing numbers of 
neutrons in the atomic nucleus.  For example, even though oxygen always has eight protons, 
it may have from seven to ten neutrons, each representing a different isotope of oxygen.  
The most prevalent and stable form of oxygen contains eight neutrons as well as eight protons 
and eight electrons, and has an atomic weight of 16.  Isotopes in which the number of 
neutrons is different from the number of protons are often unstable and radioactive.



5.Ions result from changes in the number of electrons orbiting the atomic 
nucleus.  In most atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.  When 
the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons in the nucleus, that atom will 
have a positive or negative electrical charge.  For example, a hydrogen atom easily gives up 
its single electron to another atom or molecule and becomes a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+).  In the hydrogen atom, a single negatively charged electron and a single 
positively charged proton give a total or net charge of zero.  The charge of the hydrogen ion 
comes from the fact that it has lost an electron but still has a positively charged proton.  
Atoms with an electrical charge are called ions.

Of the normal argon atom?



3.What is the atomic weight of a hydrogen atom?  Of a hydrogen
ion?



4.When table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) is dissolved in water,
its two components separate as they go into solution.  Each sodium atom in
salt gives one of its electrons to a chlorine atom.  As a consequence, the
sodium atoms are positively charged and the chlorine atoms are negatively
charged.  Are they ions or isotopes?



5.What is the charge on each one?



6.Deuterium or 'heavy hydrogen' is frequently used in scientific
research.  It contains a neutron as well as a proton in its nucleus.  This makes
it an _____________ of hydrogen.



7.Does deuterium have an electrical charge?  Describe your
reasoning.



8.What is the approximate mass of deuterium? 





Exercise 2

Reading the Periodic Table

Look at the periodic table of the elements on the next page.  Notice the following 
points:

Background

1.
Each element is identified by an abbreviation (H = hydrogen, Li = lithium, 
Na = sodium, K = potassium and so on - see the page following the table for a 
complete list).  Find these elements in the table and identify the group to which 
each belongs.  Groups are designated by a Roman numeral at the top of each
column.
Table 2.  Group Identification

Atom  Group  
hydrogen   
lithium   
sodium   
potassium   




2.Elements in each group have common structural and functional 
	properties.  For example, the elements in Group IA each have one electron in 
	the outer shell of their atoms and are thus highly reactive.  They tend to lose 
	this electron in chemical reactions and to become ions with a single positive 
	charge (e.g., H+, Na+, K+).  Atoms in Group IIA each have two electrons in their 
	outer orbit which are also easily given up to form ions.  What is the charge on 
	these ions? _____________ How would you write the abbreviations for calcium and 
	magnesium ions?



3.In the periodic table that
follows, the number of protons (and in most cases, also of
electrons and neutrons) is
designated by the number in the lower left corner of each box in the periodic 
table (e.g., H has 1, Li has 3, and Na has 11 protons).  This is the atomic number
of the element.  What is the atomic number of:

phosphorus (P)?_____________
sulfur (S)?_____________



4As noted previously, each neutron and proton has a mass of one, while 
			the weight of each electron is infinitesimal (close to zero).  Thus, 
			helium (He ) has an atomic number of 2, meaning it generally contains 
			2 protons, 2 electrons, and  2 neutrons.  Helium has an atomic weight of 
			4.003, as shown at the top of the box.  What is the atomic weight of:




carbon (C)_____________
nitrogen_____________
oxygen_____________



5.Elements are arranged in the periodic table from left to right and top to bottom 
in order of increasing mass.  The table starts with hydrogen (with an atomic number 
of one) and goes to unnilennium  (with an atomic number of 109).  There is an element 
for each atomic number in between, except for 108 which has not yet been observed.  
What element has an atomic number of 26? ________________  Is this element important 
in living things?  ____  Explain.



6.Only the lighter elements occur in living things.  In particular, living organisms 
are composed of about 25 of the elements in the top four rows of the periodic table.  
For example, what element has an atomic weight of 40.08 and where does this occur in 
living things?



7.Approximately 25 elements occur in living things.  Six of these 25
elements are of critical importance in that they comprise the four
major groups of molecules found in living organisms:  carbohydrates, lipids, proteins 
and nucleic acids.  These elements are called CHNOPS for short. 

To Do

fats alone? Which of the CHNOPS elements are completely absent from carbos and
fats?







Exercise 3
Electron Orbitals and Reactivity


Review

1.Electrons revolve 
around atomic nuclei in specific patterns called orbitals.  
The first orbital holds up to two electrons.  The second and third orbitals hold 
up to eight electrons each.  (Actually it is more complicated than this but we will 
use the simple model.)  The first orbital fills up before any electrons go into the 
second orbital, the second orbital fills up before any electrons go into the third 
orbital, and so on.  An orbital diagram for phosphorus is shown below.  Phosphorus 
has an atomic number of 15.  Thus phosphorus has 15 protons and 15 neutrons in its 
nucleus with 15 electrons orbiting around the nucleus.  Of these 15 electrons, 2 are 
in the first orbit, 8 are in the second orbit, and 5 are in the third orbit.  There 
are three 'empty' places for electrons in
the third orbit.

orbital diagramming to explain why these gases are inert.

role in living tissue.  What are they, what are their abbreviations, and what do
they do?

	and thus of all intelligent life.  The element below it in Group IVA forms
the backbone of intelligent machines.  What intelligent machines do we mean, and
what is the element used to create them?

oxygen.  Can you give one reason why such a substitution may be
possible?

Chapter 4:	THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D:	Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 1 of 7)  
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly through a 
microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different from atoms of other 
elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules or may be packed together 
in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 3 of 7)   
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means greater 
average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated. In solids, the atoms 
are closely locked in position and can only vibrate. In liquids, the atoms or molecules 
have higher energy, are more loosely connected, and can slide past one another; some 
molecules may get enough energy to escape into a gas.  In gases, the atoms or molecules 
have still more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 6 of 7)  
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly reactive 
metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as chlorine, fluorine, and 
oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive gases (such as helium and neon). An 
especially important kind of reaction between substances involves combination of oxygen 
with something else as in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the 
categories; among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.

Chapter 4:	THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D:	Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 1 of 7)  
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly through a 
microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different from atoms of other 
elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules or may be packed together 
in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 3 of 7)   
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means greater 
average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated. In solids, the atoms 
are closely locked in position and can only vibrate. In liquids, the atoms or molecules 
have higher energy, are more loosely connected, and can slide past one another; some 
molecules may get enough energy to escape into a gas.  In gases, the atoms or molecules 
have still more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 6 of 7)  
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly reactive 
metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as chlorine, fluorine, and 
oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive gases (such as helium and neon). An 
especially important kind of reaction between substances involves combination of oxygen 
with something else as in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the 
categories; among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.

Time


Exercises 1-3 take approximately 2 hours.

Until very recently, scientists believed that atoms were the smallest unit of matter which 
existed.  It was only by studying atoms, the stuff all matter is made of, that scientists 
came to be able to split the atom and "look" inside.
For the purpose of this lab, it will not be necessary to borrow a linear accelerator.  It 
will be necessary to begin to develop a basic understanding of atoms.  What are they?  What 
are some of the more common atoms?  Where do they exist in our bodies?
In a brief set of exercises, we will explore common atoms, the periodic table, and atomic 
structure.

To Ponder


1.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. How does matter get recycled?


2.
How can we eat many different kinds of animal and plants and use those materials to 
construct or our bodies?


3.
Plants don't eat as we do. How do they construct themselves?


4.

Periodic Table




Objectives


Once you have completed these exercises you should be able
to: 


1.
Understand what atoms are and what they are composed of.


2.
Describe how the components of an atom may vary.


3.
Identify the distinguishing structural features of an atom and how they affect the atom's properties.


4.
Read the periodic table of elements.


5.
Calculate the atomic weight of an atom,
given its atomic number. 




Background
Information


There are 109 known elements.  Oxygen, gold, and arsenic are examples of 
elements in the entire universe.  The smallest unit into which an element may be divided 
while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that element is an 
atom. Atoms are tiny, tiny invisible particles. All substances on earth are made of 
different combinations of the 109 elements.





Powerful Idea



An individual atom of gold has all the attributes of the substance, gold.  A gold atom, 
and in fact all atoms, are made up of smaller components called protons, neutrons, 
and electrons.  However, the subunits of an atom of gold do not, by themselves, have 
the properties of gold.  To restate a powerful idea, an atom is the smallest unit into 
which an element may be divided while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that 
element.
   

Many non-science majors are 'turned off by' or fearful of studying chemistry.  Who cares 
about invisible stuff?  Well, it happens that a little chemistry can be amazingly empowering 
in helping people to answer practical questions such as: 'How can I lose weight?'  
'What happens to a woman's body when she gets pregnant?'  'What happens to my body if I smoke 
or drink?  Thus, it will be rewarding if you keep your mind open and your curiosity peaked 
during this and subsequent labs.  If you do, you are liable to find it interesting!  
And relatively easy.  We only need to know the basic basics in this course.







A.Atoms are composed of three types 
of particles, the neutron, the proton, and the electron.



1.Each type of particle has a different charge.

A proton has an electrical charge of  +1.
An electron has an electrical charge of  -1.
A  neutron has no electrical charge associated with it.



2.Two of the three particles have significant mass.

A proton has a mass of 1 Atomic Mass Unit (AMU).
A neutron has a mass of 1 AMU.
An electron has negligible mass (zero for our purposes).
Note that atomic mass may be conventionally reported as numbers alone, without the AMU 
	designation.



3.Location: Two of the three particles are located in the atomic nucleus and the third 
orbits the nucleus.

Neutrons and protons are tightly packed into the middle of the atom, a region called the 
atomic nucleus (not to be confused with a cell nucleus!).
Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus in complex patterns or orbitals which are determined by 
how many electrons the particular atom has.



B.Most, but not all, atoms have equal numbers of protons, electrons and neutrons.




1.
The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is the primary determining factor 
for the general characteristics of the atom.  Each different element has a different number 
of protons in its atomic nucleus.  Atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic 
nucleus are the same element, regardless of whether they have the same numbers of neutrons or 
electrons.


2.For example, 
all atoms with 1 proton are hydrogen,
all atoms with 6 protons are carbon,
all atoms with 7 protons are nitrogen,
all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen,
regardless of the numbers of neutrons and electrons they may have associated with them.



3.Hydrogen is different from all other atoms in that the hydrogen atom normally does not 
contain a neutron.  That is,
the hydrogen atom is composed
of one proton and one
electron but
no neutron.



4.Isotopes are atoms of an element which have differing numbers of 
neutrons in the atomic nucleus.  For example, even though oxygen always has eight protons, 
it may have from seven to ten neutrons, each representing a different isotope of oxygen.  
The most prevalent and stable form of oxygen contains eight neutrons as well as eight protons 
and eight electrons, and has an atomic weight of 16.  Isotopes in which the number of 
neutrons is different from the number of protons are often unstable and radioactive.



5.Ions result from changes in the number of electrons orbiting the atomic 
nucleus.  In most atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.  When 
the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons in the nucleus, that atom will 
have a positive or negative electrical charge.  For example, a hydrogen atom easily gives up 
its single electron to another atom or molecule and becomes a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+).  In the hydrogen atom, a single negatively charged electron and a single 
positively charged proton give a total or net charge of zero.  The charge of the hydrogen ion 
comes from the fact that it has lost an electron but still has a positively charged proton.  
Atoms with an electrical charge are called ions.

Of the normal argon atom?



3.What is the atomic weight of a hydrogen atom?  Of a hydrogen
ion?



4.When table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) is dissolved in water,
its two components separate as they go into solution.  Each sodium atom in
salt gives one of its electrons to a chlorine atom.  As a consequence, the
sodium atoms are positively charged and the chlorine atoms are negatively
charged.  Are they ions or isotopes?



5.What is the charge on each one?



6.Deuterium or 'heavy hydrogen' is frequently used in scientific
research.  It contains a neutron as well as a proton in its nucleus.  This makes
it an _____________ of hydrogen.



7.Does deuterium have an electrical charge?  Describe your
reasoning.



8.What is the approximate mass of deuterium? 





Exercise 2

Reading the Periodic Table

Look at the periodic table of the elements on the next page.  Notice the following 
points:

Background

1.
Each element is identified by an abbreviation (H = hydrogen, Li = lithium, 
Na = sodium, K = potassium and so on - see the page following the table for a 
complete list).  Find these elements in the table and identify the group to which 
each belongs.  Groups are designated by a Roman numeral at the top of each
column.
Table 2.  Group Identification

Atom  Group  
hydrogen   
lithium   
sodium   
potassium   




2.Elements in each group have common structural and functional 
	properties.  For example, the elements in Group IA each have one electron in 
	the outer shell of their atoms and are thus highly reactive.  They tend to lose 
	this electron in chemical reactions and to become ions with a single positive 
	charge (e.g., H+, Na+, K+).  Atoms in Group IIA each have two electrons in their 
	outer orbit which are also easily given up to form ions.  What is the charge on 
	these ions? _____________ How would you write the abbreviations for calcium and 
	magnesium ions?



3.In the periodic table that
follows, the number of protons (and in most cases, also of
electrons and neutrons) is
designated by the number in the lower left corner of each box in the periodic 
table (e.g., H has 1, Li has 3, and Na has 11 protons).  This is the atomic number
of the element.  What is the atomic number of:

phosphorus (P)?_____________
sulfur (S)?_____________



4As noted previously, each neutron and proton has a mass of one, while 
			the weight of each electron is infinitesimal (close to zero).  Thus, 
			helium (He ) has an atomic number of 2, meaning it generally contains 
			2 protons, 2 electrons, and  2 neutrons.  Helium has an atomic weight of 
			4.003, as shown at the top of the box.  What is the atomic weight of:




carbon (C)_____________
nitrogen_____________
oxygen_____________



5.Elements are arranged in the periodic table from left to right and top to bottom 
in order of increasing mass.  The table starts with hydrogen (with an atomic number 
of one) and goes to unnilennium  (with an atomic number of 109).  There is an element 
for each atomic number in between, except for 108 which has not yet been observed.  
What element has an atomic number of 26? ________________  Is this element important 
in living things?  ____  Explain.



6.Only the lighter elements occur in living things.  In particular, living organisms 
are composed of about 25 of the elements in the top four rows of the periodic table.  
For example, what element has an atomic weight of 40.08 and where does this occur in 
living things?



7.Approximately 25 elements occur in living things.  Six of these 25
elements are of critical importance in that they comprise the four
major groups of molecules found in living organisms:  carbohydrates, lipids, proteins 
and nucleic acids.  These elements are called CHNOPS for short. 

To Do

Find the six elements in the periodic table and complete the chart below. Learn all you 
can about these six atoms.

15.Can your body obtain what it needs by eating carbohydrates or
fats alone? Which of the CHNOPS elements are completely absent from carbos and
fats?







Exercise 3
Electron Orbitals and Reactivity


Review

1.Electrons revolve 
around atomic nuclei in specific patterns called orbitals.  
The first orbital holds up to two electrons.  The second and third orbitals hold 
up to eight electrons each.  (Actually it is more complicated than this but we will 
use the simple model.)  The first orbital fills up before any electrons go into the 
second orbital, the second orbital fills up before any electrons go into the third 
orbital, and so on.  An orbital diagram for phosphorus is shown below.  Phosphorus 
has an atomic number of 15.  Thus phosphorus has 15 protons and 15 neutrons in its 
nucleus with 15 electrons orbiting around the nucleus.  Of these 15 electrons, 2 are 
in the first orbit, 8 are in the second orbit, and 5 are in the third orbit.  There 
are three 'empty' places for electrons in
the third orbit.

2.Draw an orbital diagram for each of the other five CHNOPS elements
and label each one with the name of the element, its atomic number and atomic
weight.

4.The last column in the table above shows how many covalent bonds are formed by each 
atom when they join with other atoms to form molecules.  Each covalent bond arises as the 
result of two atoms sharing a pair of electrons, one donated by each atom.  Explain the 
bonding behavior of each atom in terms of the number of electrons in its outer shell.

up to eight electrons each.  (Actually it is more complicated than this but we will 
use the simple model.)  The first orbital fills up before any electrons go into the 
second orbital, the second orbital fills up before any electrons go into the third 
orbital, and so on.  An orbital diagram for phosphorus is shown below.  Phosphorus 
has an atomic number of 15.  Thus phosphorus has 15 protons and 15 neutrons in its 
nucleus with 15 electrons orbiting around the nucleus.  Of these 15 electrons, 2 are 
in the first orbit, 8 are in the second orbit, and 5 are in the third orbit.  There 
are three 'empty' places for electrons in
the third orbit.

Chapter 4:	THE PHYSICAL SETTING
Section D:	Structure of Matter
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 1 of 7)  
All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly through a 
microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different from atoms of other 
elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules or may be packed together 
in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms into groups compose all substances.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 3 of 7)   
Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature means greater 
average energy of motion, so most substances expand when heated. In solids, the atoms 
are closely locked in position and can only vibrate. In liquids, the atoms or molecules 
have higher energy, are more loosely connected, and can slide past one another; some 
molecules may get enough energy to escape into a gas.  In gases, the atoms or molecules 
have still more energy and are free of one another except during occasional collisions.
Grade 6-8	(Benchmark 6 of 7)  
There are groups of elements that have similar properties, including highly reactive 
metals, less-reactive metals, highly reactive nonmetals (such as chlorine, fluorine, and 
oxygen), and some almost completely nonreactive gases (such as helium and neon). An 
especially important kind of reaction between substances involves combination of oxygen 
with something else as in burning or rusting. Some elements don't fit into any of the 
categories; among them are carbon and hydrogen, essential elements of living matter.

Time


Exercises 1-3 take approximately 2 hours.

Until very recently, scientists believed that atoms were the smallest unit of matter which 
existed.  It was only by studying atoms, the stuff all matter is made of, that scientists 
came to be able to split the atom and "look" inside.
For the purpose of this lab, it will not be necessary to borrow a linear accelerator.  It 
will be necessary to begin to develop a basic understanding of atoms.  What are they?  What 
are some of the more common atoms?  Where do they exist in our bodies?
In a brief set of exercises, we will explore common atoms, the periodic table, and atomic 
structure.

To Ponder


1.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. How does matter get recycled?


2.
How can we eat many different kinds of animal and plants and use those materials to 
construct or our bodies?


3.
Plants don't eat as we do. How do they construct themselves?


4.
Why doesn't all the water on earth simply disappear through evaporation?

Periodic Table




Objectives


Once you have completed these exercises you should be able
to: 


1.
Understand what atoms are and what they are composed of.


2.
Describe how the components of an atom may vary.


3.
Identify the distinguishing structural features of an atom and how they affect the atom's properties.


4.
Read the periodic table of elements.


5.
Calculate the atomic weight of an atom,
given its atomic number. 




Background
Information


There are 109 known elements.  Oxygen, gold, and arsenic are examples of 
elements in the entire universe.  The smallest unit into which an element may be divided 
while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that element is an 
atom. Atoms are tiny, tiny invisible particles. All substances on earth are made of 
different combinations of the 109 elements.





Powerful Idea



An individual atom of gold has all the attributes of the substance, gold.  A gold atom, 
and in fact all atoms, are made up of smaller components called protons, neutrons, 
and electrons.  However, the subunits of an atom of gold do not, by themselves, have 
the properties of gold.  To restate a powerful idea, an atom is the smallest unit into 
which an element may be divided while retaining all of the characteristic properties of that 
element.
   

Many non-science majors are 'turned off by' or fearful of studying chemistry.  Who cares 
about invisible stuff?  Well, it happens that a little chemistry can be amazingly empowering 
in helping people to answer practical questions such as: 'How can I lose weight?'  
'What happens to a woman's body when she gets pregnant?'  'What happens to my body if I smoke 
or drink?  Thus, it will be rewarding if you keep your mind open and your curiosity peaked 
during this and subsequent labs.  If you do, you are liable to find it interesting!  
And relatively easy.  We only need to know the basic basics in this course.







A.Atoms are composed of three types 
of particles, the neutron, the proton, and the electron.



1.Each type of particle has a different charge.

A proton has an electrical charge of  +1.
An electron has an electrical charge of  -1.
A  neutron has no electrical charge associated with it.



2.Two of the three particles have significant mass.

A proton has a mass of 1 Atomic Mass Unit (AMU).
A neutron has a mass of 1 AMU.
An electron has negligible mass (zero for our purposes).
Note that atomic mass may be conventionally reported as numbers alone, without the AMU 
	designation.



3.Location: Two of the three particles are located in the atomic nucleus and the third 
orbits the nucleus.

Neutrons and protons are tightly packed into the middle of the atom, a region called the 
atomic nucleus (not to be confused with a cell nucleus!).
Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus in complex patterns or orbitals which are determined by 
how many electrons the particular atom has.



B.Most, but not all, atoms have equal numbers of protons, electrons and neutrons.




1.
The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is the primary determining factor 
for the general characteristics of the atom.  Each different element has a different number 
of protons in its atomic nucleus.  Atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic 
nucleus are the same element, regardless of whether they have the same numbers of neutrons or 
electrons.


2.For example, 
all atoms with 1 proton are hydrogen,
all atoms with 6 protons are carbon,
all atoms with 7 protons are nitrogen,
all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen,
regardless of the numbers of neutrons and electrons they may have associated with them.



3.Hydrogen is different from all other atoms in that the hydrogen atom normally does not 
contain a neutron.  That is,
the hydrogen atom is composed
of one proton and one
electron but
no neutron.



4.Isotopes are atoms of an element which have differing numbers of 
neutrons in the atomic nucleus.  For example, even though oxygen always has eight protons, 
it may have from seven to ten neutrons, each representing a different isotope of oxygen.  
The most prevalent and stable form of oxygen contains eight neutrons as well as eight protons 
and eight electrons, and has an atomic weight of 16.  Isotopes in which the number of 
neutrons is different from the number of protons are often unstable and radioactive.



5.Ions result from changes in the number of electrons orbiting the atomic 
nucleus.  In most atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.  When 
the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons in the nucleus, that atom will 
have a positive or negative electrical charge.  For example, a hydrogen atom easily gives up 
its single electron to another atom or molecule and becomes a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+).  In the hydrogen atom, a single negatively charged electron and a single 
positively charged proton give a total or net charge of zero.  The charge of the hydrogen ion 
comes from the fact that it has lost an electron but still has a positively charged proton.  
Atoms with an electrical charge are called ions.

Of the normal argon atom?



3.What is the atomic weight of a hydrogen atom?  Of a hydrogen
ion?



4.When table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) is dissolved in water,
its two components separate as they go into solution.  Each sodium atom in
salt gives one of its electrons to a chlorine atom.  As a consequence, the
sodium atoms are positively charged and the chlorine atoms are negatively
charged.  Are they ions or isotopes?



5.What is the charge on each one?



6.Deuterium or 'heavy hydrogen' is frequently used in scientific
research.  It contains a neutron as well as a proton in its nucleus.  This makes
it an _____________ of hydrogen.



7.Does deuterium have an electrical charge?  Describe your
reasoning.



8.What is the approximate mass of deuterium? 





Exercise 2

Reading the Periodic Table

Look at the periodic table of the elements on the next page.  Notice the following 
points:

Background

1.
Each element is identified by an abbreviation (H = hydrogen, Li = lithium, 
Na = sodium, K = potassium and so on - see the page following the table for a 
complete list).  Find these elements in the table and identify the group to which 
each belongs.  Groups are designated by a Roman numeral at the top of each
column.
Table 2.  Group Identification

Atom  Group  
hydrogen   
lithium   
sodium   
potassium   




2.Elements in each group have common structural and functional 
	properties.  For example, the elements in Group IA each have one electron in 
	the outer shell of their atoms and are thus highly reactive.  They tend to lose 
	this electron in chemical reactions and to become ions with a single positive 
	charge (e.g., H+, Na+, K+).  Atoms in Group IIA each have two electrons in their 
	outer orbit which are also easily given up to form ions.  What is the charge on 
	these ions? _____________ How would you write the abbreviations for calcium and 
	magnesium ions?



3.In the periodic table that
follows, the number of protons (and in most cases, also of
electrons and neutrons) is
designated by the number in the lower left corner of each box in the periodic 
table (e.g., H has 1, Li has 3, and Na has 11 protons).  This is the atomic number
of the element.  What is the atomic number of:

phosphorus (P)?_____________
sulfur (S)?_____________



4As noted previously, each neutron and proton has a mass of one, while 
			the weight of each electron is infinitesimal (close to zero).  Thus, 
			helium (He ) has an atomic number of 2, meaning it generally contains 
			2 protons, 2 electrons, and  2 neutrons.  Helium has an atomic weight of 
			4.003, as shown at the top of the box.  What is the atomic weight of:




carbon (C)_____________
nitrogen_____________
oxygen_____________



5.Elements are arranged in the periodic table from left to right and top to bottom 
in order of increasing mass.  The table starts with hydrogen (with an atomic number 
of one) and goes to unnilennium  (with an atomic number of 109).  There is an element 
for each atomic number in between, except for 108 which has not yet been observed.  
What element has an atomic number of 26? ________________  Is this element important 
in living things?  ____  Explain.



6.Only the lighter elements occur in living things.  In particular, living organisms 
are composed of about 25 of the elements in the top four rows of the periodic table.  
For example, what element has an atomic weight of 40.08 and where does this occur in 
living things?



7.Approximately 25 elements occur in living things.  Six of these 25
elements are of critical importance in that they comprise the four
major groups of molecules found in living organisms:  carbohydrates, lipids, proteins 
and nucleic acids.  These elements are called CHNOPS for short. 

To Do

Find the six elements in the periodic table and complete the chart below. Learn all you 
can about these six atoms.

13.What is the primary means by which your body obtains phosphorus,
carbos and fats?



14.How does your body obtain the hydrogen it needs?



15.Can your body obtain what it needs by eating carbohydrates or
fats alone? Which of the CHNOPS elements are completely absent from carbos and
fats?







Exercise 3
Electron Orbitals and Reactivity


Review

1.Electrons revolve 
around atomic nuclei in specific patterns called orbitals.  
The first orbital holds up to two electrons.  The second and third orbitals hold 
up to eight electrons each.  (Actually it is more complicated than this but we will 
use the simple model.)  The first orbital fills up before any electrons go into the 
second orbital, the second orbital fills up before any electrons go into the third 
orbital, and so on.  An orbital diagram for phosphorus is shown below.  Phosphorus 
has an atomic number of 15.  Thus phosphorus has 15 protons and 15 neutrons in its 
nucleus with 15 electrons orbiting around the nucleus.  Of these 15 electrons, 2 are 
in the first orbit, 8 are in the second orbit, and 5 are in the third orbit.  There 
are three 'empty' places for electrons in
the third orbit.

3.Location: Two of the three particles are located in the atomic nucleus and the third 
orbits the nucleus.

Neutrons and protons are tightly packed into the middle of the atom, a region called the 
atomic nucleus (not to be confused with a cell nucleus!).
Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus in complex patterns or orbitals which are determined by 
how many electrons the particular atom has.3.Location: Two of the three particles are located in the atomic nucleus and the third

1.
The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is the primary determining factor 
for the general characteristics of the atom.  Each different element has a different number 
of protons in its atomic nucleus.  Atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic 
nucleus are the same element, regardless of whether they have the same numbers of neutrons or 
electrons.1.

2.For example, 
all atoms with 1 proton are hydrogen,
all atoms with 6 protons are carbon,
all atoms with 7 protons are nitrogen,
all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen,
regardless of the numbers of neutrons and electrons they may have associated with them.2.For example,

3.Hydrogen is different from all other atoms in that the hydrogen atom normally does not 
contain a neutron.  That is,
the hydrogen atom is composed
of one proton and one
electron but
no neutron.3.Hydrogen is different from all other atoms in that the hydrogen atom normally does not

4.Isotopes are atoms of an element which have differing numbers of 
neutrons in the atomic nucleus.  For example, even though oxygen always has eight protons, 
it may have from seven to ten neutrons, each representing a different isotope of oxygen.  
The most prevalent and stable form of oxygen contains eight neutrons as well as eight protons 
and eight electrons, and has an atomic weight of 16.  Isotopes in which the number of 
neutrons is different from the number of protons are often unstable and radioactive.4.Isotopes are atoms of an element which have differing numbers of

5.Ions result from changes in the number of electrons orbiting the atomic 
nucleus.  In most atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.  When 
the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons in the nucleus, that atom will 
have a positive or negative electrical charge.  For example, a hydrogen atom easily gives up 
its single electron to another atom or molecule and becomes a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+).  In the hydrogen atom, a single negatively charged electron and a single 
positively charged proton give a total or net charge of zero.  The charge of the hydrogen ion 
comes from the fact that it has lost an electron but still has a positively charged proton.  
Atoms with an electrical charge are called ions.5.Ions result from changes in the number of electrons orbiting the atomic
