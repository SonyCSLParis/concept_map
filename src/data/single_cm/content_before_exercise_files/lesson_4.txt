Background


Solution of Liquids
A solution is formed when a (usually solid) solute 
is dissolved in a liquid solvent.  Water is a common and powerful 
solvent.  When a substance is dissolved in water, each atom or molecule of the substance 
becomes surrounded by water molecules, like a prisoner surrounded by a posse.  It is this 'sphere 
of hydration' that results in the complete, even distribution of dissolved molecules in the 
liquid.
Figure 1.  An individual molecule of the solute,
 sugar, surrounded by molecules of the solvent,  water, to form a 
sphere of hydration.






Powerful Idea



Evaporation of Liquids
After a rain, puddles dry up.  Where does the water go?  It evaporates into the 
air.  When water evaporates it changes from a liquid into a 
gas, but the molecules retain the same structure and size (H2O).
  Water in the gaseous state is invisible and is called water vapor.  
Water molecules in the gaseous state are much further apart and moving much faster than water 
molecules in the liquid state.

What happens when a sugar solution evaporates?  The lighter water
molecules will escape to the atmosphere (evaporate), but
the heavier sugar molecules remain behind.  As evaporation continues,
the sugar in the solution becomes more concentrated.  Evaporation
provides a mechanism for separating the solvent from the solute.
 The molecules of each substance remain intact.

Exercise 2

Diffusion of Red Food Coloring in Water


Powerful Idea



Diffusion
Diffusion is the movement of molecules through a liquid or gaseous medium from an area of high 
concentration to an area of low concentration due to the kinetic energy of the molecules. In 
these experiments we will observe diffusion in water.

Exercise 3
Diffusion of Aromatic Molecules in
Air

Predict

1.
Can molecules travel through the air as well
as through water?  Describe any experiences or observations that
may inform your answer.

Review

2.
You know that water is made up of water molecules,
and that the molecules have many rapidly forming and breaking
hydrogen bonds between them.  You also know that the polarity
of the water molecule plays an important role when charged or
partially charged molecules of other substances dissolve in the
water.

To Do

3.
What do you know about the composition of air? 
Air contains three primary gases (below).  You are familiar with
the structure of each one.  Draw the molecular structures of the
three gases below.

~78.00 % nitrogen

~21.00 % oxygen

~0.03 % carbon dioxide

In addition, other gases such as water vapor, helium and carbon
monoxide, may be present in small quantities.  Water vapor may
be present in air in widely varying concentrations.  Particulate
matter is also often present.

stopper so the flask is open to the air in the room.  Draw a representation
of the three major gases (nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide)
in the flask using three different types of dots as shown. Label
the space between the dots.  What is there?

Exercise 4

Osmosis


Powerful Ideas


Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane 
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration of water.  It is a 
tremendously important and common phenomenon in living things.

A semipermeable membrane contains pores (channels) that allow oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, water, and certain other small molecules to pass freely.  However, most large molecules 
cannot penetrate either the semipermeable membrane itself or the pores within it.  The semipermeable 
membrane that surrounds cells is a phospholipid bilayer.  Plastic semipermeable 
membranes are available as well, from scientific supply houses.


To Do

1.
Place about 200 ml fresh water in each of two
250 ml beakers.  Add salt to one of the beakers while stirring
to make a saturated salt solution (a saturated salt solution will
have salt on the bottom of the beaker).



2.
Place a fresh stalk of celery (about 3"), a fresh carrot
(about 3"), and three - five raisins in each of the two beakers.
Figure 6. Celery, Carrots and Raisins




3.
Put your name on each beaker as well as whether it is salt
or fresh water and place the beakers on a tray at the front of
the room to go into the refrigerator until the next class meeting.

Predict

4.
What will happen to the celery and carrot in
fresh water. What texture, shape and qualities do you expect them
to have?  Explain your thinking.  Why does this seem like the
correct prediction to you?



5.
What will happen to the celery and carrot in saturated salt
water. What texture, shape and qualities do you expect them to
have?  Explain your thinking.  Why does this seem like the correct
prediction to you?

Question

6.

carrot?  Do you expect the raisins to respond in the same way
as the celery and carrot?  If not, describe what you do expect
the raisins to do in fresh and saturated salt water, and why.

Next Class Meeting:  What happened to
the celery and carrot in fresh water? Feel the vegetables, bend
them, and describe their texture and shape.

about raisins and account for any differences using a molecular
model of explanation.

 If so, what substance moved across the membrane in each case?

In Figures 7 and 8, use a short arrow to represent the
direction of a little diffusion and a long arrow to represent
the direction of a lot of diffusion of this substance into and
out of each vegetable or fruit.

diffusion a special case of osmosis?  Explain.

Question

15.
Can humans survive by drinking salt water
such as ocean water?  Why or why not?  Support your answer with
a molecular explanation.




Exercise 5

Dissolving a Solid

Predict

1.
We know that some powdery or particulate substances
like sugar dissolve easily in water.  But is it possible
to dissolve other solids?  Even if it is part of a living thing
such as an eggshell?   Describe what you expect to happen when
a fresh egg is submerged in vinegar for several days at room temperature.

To Do

2.
Submerge an egg in a beaker of vinegar.  Label
your beaker and place it on a shelf at the side of the room. 
What is the potential solvent in this case?  What is the solute?

Results

3.
Next Class Meeting:  Observe the egg
in vinegar.  Touch it, turn it, feel it, very carefully pick it
up (it may be fragile).  Examine the vinegar.  Describe and draw
both the vinegar and egg.


Results

4.
If the process is not completed, save your egg
on the shelf until next time.  If it is completed, take the egg
out and break it open in a dry beaker.  Has the egg changed, and
if so in what way(s)?

Interpret

5.
Interpret your observations.  What exactly
happened?  An eggshell is made largely of calcium carbonate, CaCO3
which can ionize into Ca2+ and CO32-.  Vinegar is acetic acid (CH3CO2H)
dissolved in water, which can ionize into H+ and CH3COO-.

Question

6.
Would the egg in vinegar reaction have occurred
faster or slower if it had been placed in the refrigerator?  Explain
your reasoning.



7.
Note: The calcium can be removed from chicken bones in a similar
manner.

Exercise 4

Osmosis


Powerful Ideas


Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane 
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration of water.  It is a 
tremendously important and common phenomenon in living things.

A semipermeable membrane contains pores (channels) that allow oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, water, and certain other small molecules to pass freely.  However, most large molecules 
cannot penetrate either the semipermeable membrane itself or the pores within it.  The semipermeable 
membrane that surrounds cells is a phospholipid bilayer.  Plastic semipermeable 
membranes are available as well, from scientific supply houses.


To Do

1.
Place about 200 ml fresh water in each of two
250 ml beakers.  Add salt to one of the beakers while stirring
to make a saturated salt solution (a saturated salt solution will
have salt on the bottom of the beaker).



2.
Place a fresh stalk of celery (about 3"), a fresh carrot
(about 3"), and three - five raisins in each of the two beakers.
Figure 6. Celery, Carrots and Raisins

5.
Interpret your observations.  What exactly
happened?  An eggshell is made largely of calcium carbonate, CaCO3
which can ionize into Ca2+ and CO32-.  Vinegar is acetic acid (CH3CO2H)
dissolved in water, which can ionize into H+ and CH3COO-.

Background


Solution of Liquids
A solution is formed when a (usually solid) solute 
is dissolved in a liquid solvent.  Water is a common and powerful 
solvent.  When a substance is dissolved in water, each atom or molecule of the substance 
becomes surrounded by water molecules, like a prisoner surrounded by a posse.  It is this 'sphere 
of hydration' that results in the complete, even distribution of dissolved molecules in the 
liquid.
Figure 1.  An individual molecule of the solute,
 sugar, surrounded by molecules of the solvent,  water, to form a 
sphere of hydration.






Powerful Idea



Evaporation of Liquids
After a rain, puddles dry up.  Where does the water go?  It evaporates into the 
air.  When water evaporates it changes from a liquid into a 
gas, but the molecules retain the same structure and size (H2O).
  Water in the gaseous state is invisible and is called water vapor.  
Water molecules in the gaseous state are much further apart and moving much faster than water 
molecules in the liquid state.

What happens when a sugar solution evaporates?  The lighter water
molecules will escape to the atmosphere (evaporate), but
the heavier sugar molecules remain behind.  As evaporation continues,
the sugar in the solution becomes more concentrated.  Evaporation
provides a mechanism for separating the solvent from the solute.
 The molecules of each substance remain intact.

Exercise 4

Osmosis


Powerful Ideas


Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane 
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration of water.  It is a 
tremendously important and common phenomenon in living things.

A semipermeable membrane contains pores (channels) that allow oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, water, and certain other small molecules to pass freely.  However, most large molecules 
cannot penetrate either the semipermeable membrane itself or the pores within it.  The semipermeable 
membrane that surrounds cells is a phospholipid bilayer.  Plastic semipermeable 
membranes are available as well, from scientific supply houses.


To Do

1.
Place about 200 ml fresh water in each of two
250 ml beakers.  Add salt to one of the beakers while stirring
to make a saturated salt solution (a saturated salt solution will
have salt on the bottom of the beaker).



2.
Place a fresh stalk of celery (about 3"), a fresh carrot
(about 3"), and three - five raisins in each of the two beakers.

Background


Solution of Liquids
A solution is formed when a (usually solid) solute 
is dissolved in a liquid solvent.  Water is a common and powerful 
solvent.  When a substance is dissolved in water, each atom or molecule of the substance 
becomes surrounded by water molecules, like a prisoner surrounded by a posse.  It is this 'sphere 
of hydration' that results in the complete, even distribution of dissolved molecules in the 
liquid.
Figure 1.  An individual molecule of the solute,
 sugar, surrounded by molecules of the solvent,  water, to form a 
sphere of hydration.






Powerful Idea



Evaporation of Liquids
After a rain, puddles dry up.  Where does the water go?  It evaporates into the 
air.  When water evaporates it changes from a liquid into a 
gas, but the molecules retain the same structure and size (H2O).
  Water in the gaseous state is invisible and is called water vapor.  
Water molecules in the gaseous state are much further apart and moving much faster than water 
molecules in the liquid state.

What happens when a sugar solution evaporates?  The lighter water
molecules will escape to the atmosphere (evaporate), but
the heavier sugar molecules remain behind.  As evaporation continues,
the sugar in the solution becomes more concentrated.  Evaporation
provides a mechanism for separating the solvent from the solute.
 The molecules of each substance remain intact.

Background


Solution of Liquids
A solution is formed when a (usually solid) solute 
is dissolved in a liquid solvent.  Water is a common and powerful 
solvent.  When a substance is dissolved in water, each atom or molecule of the substance 
becomes surrounded by water molecules, like a prisoner surrounded by a posse.  It is this 'sphere 
of hydration' that results in the complete, even distribution of dissolved molecules in the 
liquid.
Figure 1.  An individual molecule of the solute,
 sugar, surrounded by molecules of the solvent,  water, to form a 
sphere of hydration.






Powerful Idea



Evaporation of Liquids
After a rain, puddles dry up.  Where does the water go?  It evaporates into the 
air.  When water evaporates it changes from a liquid into a 
gas, but the molecules retain the same structure and size (H2O).
  Water in the gaseous state is invisible and is called water vapor.  
Water molecules in the gaseous state are much further apart and moving much faster than water 
molecules in the liquid state.

What happens when a sugar solution evaporates?  The lighter water
molecules will escape to the atmosphere (evaporate), but
the heavier sugar molecules remain behind.  As evaporation continues,
the sugar in the solution becomes more concentrated.  Evaporation
provides a mechanism for separating the solvent from the solute.
 The molecules of each substance remain intact.

Exercise 2

Diffusion of Red Food Coloring in Water


Powerful Idea



Diffusion
Diffusion is the movement of molecules through a liquid or gaseous medium from an area of high 
concentration to an area of low concentration due to the kinetic energy of the molecules. In 
these experiments we will observe diffusion in water.

Diffusion of Aromatic Molecules in
Air

Predict

1.
Can molecules travel through the air as well
as through water?  Describe any experiences or observations that
may inform your answer.

Review

2.
You know that water is made up of water molecules,
and that the molecules have many rapidly forming and breaking
hydrogen bonds between them.  You also know that the polarity
of the water molecule plays an important role when charged or
partially charged molecules of other substances dissolve in the
water.

To Do

3.
What do you know about the composition of air? 
Air contains three primary gases (below).  You are familiar with
the structure of each one.  Draw the molecular structures of the
three gases below.

~78.00 % nitrogen

~21.00 % oxygen

~0.03 % carbon dioxide

In addition, other gases such as water vapor, helium and carbon
monoxide, may be present in small quantities.  Water vapor may
be present in air in widely varying concentrations.  Particulate
matter is also often present.

Exercise 4

Osmosis


Powerful Ideas


Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane 
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration of water.  It is a 
tremendously important and common phenomenon in living things.

A semipermeable membrane contains pores (channels) that allow oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, water, and certain other small molecules to pass freely.  However, most large molecules 
cannot penetrate either the semipermeable membrane itself or the pores within it.  The semipermeable 
membrane that surrounds cells is a phospholipid bilayer.  Plastic semipermeable 
membranes are available as well, from scientific supply houses.


To Do

1.
Place about 200 ml fresh water in each of two
250 ml beakers.  Add salt to one of the beakers while stirring
to make a saturated salt solution (a saturated salt solution will
have salt on the bottom of the beaker).



2.
Place a fresh stalk of celery (about 3"), a fresh carrot
(about 3"), and three - five raisins in each of the two beakers.
Figure 6. Celery, Carrots and Raisins




3.
Put your name on each beaker as well as whether it is salt
or fresh water and place the beakers on a tray at the front of
the room to go into the refrigerator until the next class meeting.

Predict

4.
What will happen to the celery and carrot in
fresh water. What texture, shape and qualities do you expect them
to have?  Explain your thinking.  Why does this seem like the
correct prediction to you?



5.

carrot?  Do you expect the raisins to respond in the same way
as the celery and carrot?  If not, describe what you do expect
the raisins to do in fresh and saturated salt water, and why.

 If so, what substance moved across the membrane in each case?

In Figures 7 and 8, use a short arrow to represent the
direction of a little diffusion and a long arrow to represent
the direction of a lot of diffusion of this substance into and
out of each vegetable or fruit.

such as ocean water?  Why or why not?  Support your answer with
a molecular explanation.




Exercise 5

Dissolving a Solid

Predict

1.
We know that some powdery or particulate substances
like sugar dissolve easily in water.  But is it possible
to dissolve other solids?  Even if it is part of a living thing
such as an eggshell?   Describe what you expect to happen when
a fresh egg is submerged in vinegar for several days at room temperature.

To Do

2.
Submerge an egg in a beaker of vinegar.  Label
your beaker and place it on a shelf at the side of the room. 
What is the potential solvent in this case?  What is the solute?

Results

3.
Next Class Meeting:  Observe the egg
in vinegar.  Touch it, turn it, feel it, very carefully pick it
up (it may be fragile).  Examine the vinegar.  Describe and draw
both the vinegar and egg.


Results

4.
If the process is not completed, save your egg
on the shelf until next time.  If it is completed, take the egg
out and break it open in a dry beaker.  Has the egg changed, and
if so in what way(s)?

Interpret

5.
Interpret your observations.  What exactly
happened?  An eggshell is made largely of calcium carbonate, CaCO3
which can ionize into Ca2+ and CO32-.  Vinegar is acetic acid (CH3CO2H)
dissolved in water, which can ionize into H+ and CH3COO-.

Question

6.
Would the egg in vinegar reaction have occurred
faster or slower if it had been placed in the refrigerator?  Explain
your reasoning.



7.
Note: The calcium can be removed from chicken bones in a similar
manner.

Background


Solution of Liquids
A solution is formed when a (usually solid) solute 
is dissolved in a liquid solvent.  Water is a common and powerful 
solvent.  When a substance is dissolved in water, each atom or molecule of the substance 
becomes surrounded by water molecules, like a prisoner surrounded by a posse.  It is this 'sphere 
of hydration' that results in the complete, even distribution of dissolved molecules in the 
liquid.
Figure 1.  An individual molecule of the solute,
 sugar, surrounded by molecules of the solvent,  water, to form a 
sphere of hydration.

Powerful Idea



Evaporation of Liquids
After a rain, puddles dry up.  Where does the water go?  It evaporates into the 
air.  When water evaporates it changes from a liquid into a 
gas, but the molecules retain the same structure and size (H2O).
  Water in the gaseous state is invisible and is called water vapor.  
Water molecules in the gaseous state are much further apart and moving much faster than water 
molecules in the liquid state.

What happens when a sugar solution evaporates?  The lighter water
molecules will escape to the atmosphere (evaporate), but
the heavier sugar molecules remain behind.  As evaporation continues,
the sugar in the solution becomes more concentrated.  Evaporation
provides a mechanism for separating the solvent from the solute.
 The molecules of each substance remain intact.
