The Properties of Water

Grade Level

Prospective and Practicing K-8 Teachers; may be adapted for use in elementary classes
Time


Exercises 1-4 take approximately 2 hours.

Water is everywhere.  It's in the air we breathe. It's in our sink faucets, and
it's in every cell of our body. Water is an unusual substance with special
properties. Just think about the wonder of water:

To Ponder


1.How does water rise from the roots of a redwood tree to 
the very top?


2.How do insects walk on water?


3.Why does ice float rather than sink?


4.Why do people become seriously ill, or die, if they go 
without liquid for a week or so?


5.How would life in a lake be affected if ice sank and
lakes froze from the bottom up?

In this first lab, we will
investigate the properties of water in an attempt to understand how water behaves
in relation to both our bodies and the environment. Through a concise set of
experiments, the unique properties of water and its consequent importance to
living things will become apparent.

Objectives


Once you have completed this exercise you should be able to:


1.Describe the polarity of a water molecule and explain
how that polarity affects the properties of water.


2.Explain why water climbs the inside of a thin glass
capillary but not a thin plastic capillary.


3.Explain why water climbs a paper strip.


4.Describe a system whereby the components of a
water-based substance might be separated and discuss how this separation
occurs.


5.Explain why oil and water don't mix.


6.Predict whether a substance, based on its hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic properties, will dissolve into
water or oil.



Background
Information


Water covers about three fourths of the surface of the earth?  It
is ubiquitous.  It is also one of the simplest yet most important molecules in
living systems.  It makes up from 50 to 95 percent of the weight of living
organisms.  The cytoplasm of a cell is a water-based solution that contains a
variety of ions, salts, and molecules which make life 'happen.'  Water is
literally involved in every facet of life.
Figure 2.  Polarity of Water Molecule


The simplicity of the water molecule belies the complexity of its properties. 
Based on its small size and light weight, one can predict how it should 
behave, yet it remains liquid at a much higher
temperatures than expected. It also boilsand freezes at much too high, or low, of a
temperature for a molecule of its size.  Many of these unexpected properties of
water  are due to the fact that water molecules are attracted to each other like
small magnets (cohesion).  This attraction
results in turn from the structure of the water molecule and the characteristics
of the atoms it contains.

Each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen connected to one atom
of oxygen, as shown below.  This is summarized in the familiar formula,
H2O. 
Figure 3.  Hydrogen Bonding in Water




Powerful Idea


Atoms are most stable when they have a particular configuration
of their outer shells, a concept which will be discussed in future labs.  These
configurations explain why hydrogen in water will take on a partial positive charge and why oxygen will
take on a partial negative charge. These
partial charges cause water molecules to 'stick' to each other like  magnets. 
The 'stickiness' in this particular case is due to 'hydrogen bonding'. In this case, hydrogen 
bonding involves  the attraction between the positively charged hydrogen atom of one
water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen atom of another water molecule.   As no electrons are actually shared however, hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent
bonds - they easily break and easily form again.

Exercise 2

The Climbing Property of Water


Background

1.Water moves to the tops of tall trees due to capillary action combined with root pressure
and evaporation from the stomata
(openings) in the leaves.  Water will also climb up paper, and often the
migrating water will carry other molecules along with it.  The distance traveled
by these other molecules will vary with their mass and charge.

3.Obtain a 50 ml graduated cylinder,  and tear off a strip of 
chromatography paper that is just long enough to hang over the side of the 
cylinder (inside) and reach to the bottom.




Figure 6.  50 ml Graduated Cylinder with Chromatography Paper & Ink


To Do

4.Run the paper strip along the edge of a scissors to take the curl 
out of it.



5.Place a single small drop of ink from a black vis-a-vis pen on the

Exercise 3

Cohesion of Water




3a
Water & Oil

To Do

1.Put 8 ml of water into a 10 ml graduated cylinder.

Predict

2.What will happen if you add cooking oil?  (Predict by choosing a, 
b, c, d, or e below)
	a. the oil will float on top of the water
	b. the oil will sink to the bottom of the water
	c. the oil will dissolve in the water
	d. the oil will become mixed up with the water
	e. other (what?)






Oil is a hydrophobic or 'water hating' molecule, so called because its chemical 
structure does not allow the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, oil does not 
dissolve in water. When mixed, the two substances form separate layers, and because 
oil is less dense, it sits on top of water.

The Properties of Water

Grade Level

Prospective and Practicing K-8 Teachers; may be adapted for use in elementary classes
Time


Exercises 1-4 take approximately 2 hours.

Water is everywhere.  It's in the air we breathe. It's in our sink faucets, and
it's in every cell of our body. Water is an unusual substance with special
properties. Just think about the wonder of water:

To Ponder


1.How does water rise from the roots of a redwood tree to 
the very top?


2.How do insects walk on water?


3.Why does ice float rather than sink?


4.Why do people become seriously ill, or die, if they go 
without liquid for a week or so?


5.How would life in a lake be affected if ice sank and
lakes froze from the bottom up?

In this first lab, we will
investigate the properties of water in an attempt to understand how water behaves
in relation to both our bodies and the environment. Through a concise set of
experiments, the unique properties of water and its consequent importance to
living things will become apparent.

Objectives


Once you have completed this exercise you should be able to:


1.Describe the polarity of a water molecule and explain
how that polarity affects the properties of water.


2.Explain why water climbs the inside of a thin glass
capillary but not a thin plastic capillary.


3.Explain why water climbs a paper strip.


4.Describe a system whereby the components of a
water-based substance might be separated and discuss how this separation
occurs.


5.Explain why oil and water don't mix.


6.Predict whether a substance, based on its hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic properties, will dissolve into
water or oil.



Background
Information


Water covers about three fourths of the surface of the earth?  It
is ubiquitous.  It is also one of the simplest yet most important molecules in
living systems.  It makes up from 50 to 95 percent of the weight of living
organisms.  The cytoplasm of a cell is a water-based solution that contains a
variety of ions, salts, and molecules which make life 'happen.'  Water is
literally involved in every facet of life.
Figure 2.  Polarity of Water Molecule


The simplicity of the water molecule belies the complexity of its properties. 
Based on its small size and light weight, one can predict how it should 
behave, yet it remains liquid at a much higher
temperatures than expected. It also boilsand freezes at much too high, or low, of a
temperature for a molecule of its size.  Many of these unexpected properties of
water  are due to the fact that water molecules are attracted to each other like
small magnets (cohesion).  This attraction
results in turn from the structure of the water molecule and the characteristics
of the atoms it contains.

Each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen connected to one atom
of oxygen, as shown below.  This is summarized in the familiar formula,
H2O. 
Figure 3.  Hydrogen Bonding in Water




Powerful Idea


Atoms are most stable when they have a particular configuration
of their outer shells, a concept which will be discussed in future labs.  These
configurations explain why hydrogen in water will take on a partial positive charge and why oxygen will
take on a partial negative charge. These
partial charges cause water molecules to 'stick' to each other like  magnets. 
The 'stickiness' in this particular case is due to 'hydrogen bonding'. In this case, hydrogen 
bonding involves  the attraction between the positively charged hydrogen atom of one
water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen atom of another water molecule.   As no electrons are actually shared however, hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent
bonds - they easily break and easily form again.

Exercise 2

The Climbing Property of Water


Background

1.Water moves to the tops of tall trees due to capillary action combined with root pressure
and evaporation from the stomata
(openings) in the leaves.  Water will also climb up paper, and often the
migrating water will carry other molecules along with it.  The distance traveled
by these other molecules will vary with their mass and charge.

Water & Oil

To Do

1.Put 8 ml of water into a 10 ml graduated cylinder.

Predict

2.What will happen if you add cooking oil?  (Predict by choosing a, 
b, c, d, or e below)
	a. the oil will float on top of the water
	b. the oil will sink to the bottom of the water
	c. the oil will dissolve in the water
	d. the oil will become mixed up with the water
	e. other (what?)






Oil is a hydrophobic or 'water hating' molecule, so called because its chemical 
structure does not allow the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, oil does not 
dissolve in water. When mixed, the two substances form separate layers, and because 
oil is less dense, it sits on top of water.

The Properties of Water

Grade Level

Prospective and Practicing K-8 Teachers; may be adapted for use in elementary classes
Time


Exercises 1-4 take approximately 2 hours.

Water is everywhere.  It's in the air we breathe. It's in our sink faucets, and
it's in every cell of our body. Water is an unusual substance with special
properties. Just think about the wonder of water:

To Ponder


1.How does water rise from the roots of a redwood tree to 
the very top?


2.How do insects walk on water?


3.Why does ice float rather than sink?


4.Why do people become seriously ill, or die, if they go 
without liquid for a week or so?


5.How would life in a lake be affected if ice sank and
lakes froze from the bottom up?

In this first lab, we will
investigate the properties of water in an attempt to understand how water behaves
in relation to both our bodies and the environment. Through a concise set of
experiments, the unique properties of water and its consequent importance to
living things will become apparent.

Objectives


Once you have completed this exercise you should be able to:


1.Describe the polarity of a water molecule and explain
how that polarity affects the properties of water.


2.Explain why water climbs the inside of a thin glass
capillary but not a thin plastic capillary.


3.Explain why water climbs a paper strip.


4.Describe a system whereby the components of a
water-based substance might be separated and discuss how this separation
occurs.


5.Explain why oil and water don't mix.


6.Predict whether a substance, based on its hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic properties, will dissolve into
water or oil.



Background
Information


Water covers about three fourths of the surface of the earth?  It
is ubiquitous.  It is also one of the simplest yet most important molecules in
living systems.  It makes up from 50 to 95 percent of the weight of living
organisms.  The cytoplasm of a cell is a water-based solution that contains a
variety of ions, salts, and molecules which make life 'happen.'  Water is
literally involved in every facet of life.
Figure 2.  Polarity of Water Molecule


The simplicity of the water molecule belies the complexity of its properties. 
Based on its small size and light weight, one can predict how it should 
behave, yet it remains liquid at a much higher
temperatures than expected. It also boilsand freezes at much too high, or low, of a
temperature for a molecule of its size.  Many of these unexpected properties of
water  are due to the fact that water molecules are attracted to each other like
small magnets (cohesion).  This attraction
results in turn from the structure of the water molecule and the characteristics
of the atoms it contains.

Each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen connected to one atom
of oxygen, as shown below.  This is summarized in the familiar formula,
H2O. 
Figure 3.  Hydrogen Bonding in Water




Powerful Idea


Atoms are most stable when they have a particular configuration
of their outer shells, a concept which will be discussed in future labs.  These
configurations explain why hydrogen in water will take on a partial positive charge and why oxygen will
take on a partial negative charge. These
partial charges cause water molecules to 'stick' to each other like  magnets. 
The 'stickiness' in this particular case is due to 'hydrogen bonding'. In this case, hydrogen 
bonding involves  the attraction between the positively charged hydrogen atom of one
water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen atom of another water molecule.   As no electrons are actually shared however, hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent
bonds - they easily break and easily form again.

Exercise 2

The Climbing Property of Water


Background

1.Water moves to the tops of tall trees due to capillary action combined with root pressure
and evaporation from the stomata
(openings) in the leaves.  Water will also climb up paper, and often the
migrating water will carry other molecules along with it.  The distance traveled
by these other molecules will vary with their mass and charge.

2.How fast do you think water would climb a strip of absorbent paper 
about one-half inch wide?  
about one inch per ____________________ (time)

To Do

3.Obtain a 50 ml graduated cylinder,  and tear off a strip of 
chromatography paper that is just long enough to hang over the side of the 
cylinder (inside) and reach to the bottom.




Figure 6.  50 ml Graduated Cylinder with Chromatography Paper & Ink


To Do

4.Run the paper strip along the edge of a scissors to take the curl 
out of it.



5.Place a single small drop of ink from a black vis-a-vis pen on the 
paper, about one inch from the bottom, and let it dry completely.

Exercise 3

Cohesion of Water




3a
Water & Oil

To Do

1.Put 8 ml of water into a 10 ml graduated cylinder.

Predict

2.What will happen if you add cooking oil?  (Predict by choosing a, 
b, c, d, or e below)
	a. the oil will float on top of the water
	b. the oil will sink to the bottom of the water
	c. the oil will dissolve in the water
	d. the oil will become mixed up with the water
	e. other (what?)






Oil is a hydrophobic or 'water hating' molecule, so called because its chemical 
structure does not allow the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, oil does not 
dissolve in water. When mixed, the two substances form separate layers, and because 
oil is less dense, it sits on top of water.

slightly and letting the oil run slowly down the inside of the
cylinder.

Powerful Idea


Atoms are most stable when they have a particular configuration
of their outer shells, a concept which will be discussed in future labs.  These
configurations explain why hydrogen in water will take on a partial positive charge and why oxygen will
take on a partial negative charge. These
partial charges cause water molecules to 'stick' to each other like  magnets. 
The 'stickiness' in this particular case is due to 'hydrogen bonding'. In this case, hydrogen 
bonding involves  the attraction between the positively charged hydrogen atom of one
water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen atom of another water molecule.   As no electrons are actually shared however, hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent
bonds - they easily break and easily form again.Powerful Idea
