Background
Information


Cells
According to the cell theory, proposed over 150 years ago:

All living things are composed of cells.
  All cells come from pre-existing cells.
  Cells are the smallest units of life.

Most cells are very, very small, so tiny that they can only be seen with
the aid of a microscope. Your body is composed of billions of cells! Within
your body, cells have different functions. We have blood cells, skin cells,
brain cells...the list goes on. Despite their differences, cells in living
organisms for the most part have similar structures and functions.

Question 
 
1.
Have you ever seen a cell? When? What do you remember about it?
 



Powerful Idea


Cells found in the animal and plant kingdoms (with just a few exceptions)
have these features in common:

cell membrane which serves as a boundary between the cell and
  the outside environment
  cytoplasm containing organelles
nucleus containing hereditary material (DNA)
  mitochondrion (plural, mitochondria), where cellular
  respiration takes place (the breakdown of sugars to produce energy
  for the cell, a process that uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and
  water)
  smooth endoplasmic reticulum where lipids are made
  rough endoplasmic reticulum where proteins are made with the
  help of ribosomes


Plant cells have, in addition to those components listed above, the
  following organelles


chloroplast which uses light energy to convert six carbon dioxide
  molecules into one organic six-carbon sugar
  cell wall outside
  the cell membrane which provides additional strength
  vacuole, a large organelle containing water, often with dissolved
  pigments, waste materials, or other substances


Cells come in many sizes and shapes, as illustrated in Figure 2a and
  b.

Drawing 2. Plant Cell

 



  To Notice
 
5.
Note that drawings can be misleading. For example, a drawing typically shows
one or a few mitochondria in a cell, but cells actually contain many mitochondria,
sometimes 10,000 or more. Also, drawings are two-dimensional whereas cells
are three-dimensional.

  To Do
 
6.
In your drawings, briefly note of the functions of each organelle.

  Question
 
7.
How are plant cells different from animal cells? In what ways are they
similar?
 

 
 
8.

  Question
 
9.

10.
Figure 3 shows a portion of a cell membrane. Label the parts of the molecules
shown.

Figure 3. Cell Membrane

 



 
 
11.
The cell membrane is selectively
permeable, allowing only certain substances from the outside environment
to enter the cell. What sorts of molecules pass through a phospholipid membrane
easily? What sorts of substances do not pass through a membrane readily?
 



Exercise 2


Dynamic Cell Simulation Introduction


 Background

1.
Cells are constantly making and breaking down molecules of all types. Proteins
make up a diverse and important category of large biological molecules.
Proteins manage biochemical reactions, provide physical strength in cells,
aid in cell-to-cell communication, and many other tasks.



2.
Your group will go through a simplified simulation of how proteins are made
in the cell. The goal is to see the living cell as a site of constant metabolic
activity, not a motionless structure. Another goal is to appreciate how
the functions of different organelles are interconnected.



3.
Members of each lab group will perform different functions within the simulated
cell. The end result will be the production of a small protein.



Exercise 3


Simulation Set Up


 To Do

1.
Collect the materials for the lab. Table 1 summarizes what each item
represents in the simulation. Refer back to this table as needed during
the simulation.

Table 1. Materials and cell structures
they represent.

Material:
Represents:

paper models
organelles

lab table or desktop
cell cytoplasm

5 cookies
glucose molecules

10 Hershey's kisses
ATP molecules

10 colored gumdrops
amino acids

5 toothpicks
peptide bonds

10 colored pipe cleaners
transfer RNAs





2.
Set up your cell. First, make models of organelles. One group member cuts
out the organelle models shown in Figure 4 from their handout. You only
need one set of organelles for each group. This simulation will only involve
two organelles: the mitochondrion and the nucleus; and a ribosome (which
is a structure, not an organelle).

 

Figure 4. Organelle Models for Dynamic
Cell Simulation (not drawn to scale)

 


Ribosome

 



 





3.
Place the organelles on your desk or lab table. Pretend that your desk surface
is the cytoplasm of the cell and that the edges represent the cell membrane.



4.
Next, divide up the tasks. There will be four players. Table 2 describes
the different roles group members will play.

 

Table 2. Different roles of players in
the simulation.

Player 1 "Sugar Splitting" Enzymes
In the cytoplasm and mitochondria, sugar-splitting enzymes break bonds in
sugar molecules to release stored energy. In the process, energy is captured
in the bonds of another molecule, ATP, which carries chemical energy to
other parts of the cell.

Player 2 RNA Polymerase
In the nucleus, the RNA polymerase copies small segments of DNA to make
a complementary RNA molecule.
The copy, a "messenger" RNA molecule, leaves the nucleus and heads
to a ribosome.

Player 3 Transfer RNA(tRNA) Manager
In the cytoplasm, transfer RNA is linked to an amino acid. This requires
energy, usually provided by ATP. The transfer RNA then carries its attached
amino acid to the ribosome.

Player 4 Ribosome
Attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, the ribosome "reads" the
messenger RNA (mRNA) in three-letter "words," or codons.
A transfer RNA brings in an amino acid corresponding to each codon. The
amino acids are joined together into a chain with help from the ribosome.



 Question
 
5.
What is an enzyme, anyway?
 
 



Exercise 4


Harvesting Energy from Glucose in the Mitochondrion

To Do

1.
To start the simulation of the process of cellular respiration, Player 1
places the glucose molecules (cookies) in the mitochondrion and puts the
ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses) off to the side.



2.
Player 1 (mitochondrial "sugar splitting" enzymes) breaks a cookie
in half. This represents breaking the bonds which hold a glucose molecule
together. This process uses oxygen gas and releases carbon dioxide and water.

Question

3.
Does the breaking of chemical bonds in glucose release energy or consume
energy? Explain?
 

Background

4.
The cell stores some of the energy released from the bonds in glucose in
special bonds of ATP molecules. ATP is called the "universal energy
carrier of cells" because it can travel to other places in the cell
and provide energy for other chemical reactions (such as protein synthesis).

To Do

5.
Each time a cookie is broken in half, two ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses)
are produced. Player 1 breaks a cookie in half to produce two ATP molecules.

Then, he/she breaks the two halves in half again. This will break two
more bonds and produce four more Hershey's kisses, or six total ATP for
each glucose molecule.




6.
Player 1 now transports the six ATP molecules to the cytoplasm where they
will be used by other members of the group.

 

Exercise 5

Reading the Genetic Code in the Nucleus


Background

1.
Now that some cellular energy has been stored in ATP molecules, the next
stop is the nucleus, where a message will be created that can be sent out
to direct the creation of a protein.



2.
The DNA always remains in the nucleus, protected by the nuclear membrane
(except during cell division). The genetic "blueprints" for any
protein are found encoded in genes, which are sections of the DNA. DNA is
a nucleic acid and is composed of four types of molecules called nucleotides. We often use letters
to represent the four different types of nucleotide molecules.

A=adenine
  T=thymine
  C=cytosine
  G=guanine





3.
RNA is also a nucleic acid and are made of a long chain of nucleotides.
However, RNA does not contain thymine (T); it contains uracil (U), a similar
nucleotide, instead.



4.
One type of RNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA). It is a copy of a
DNA gene and it is made in the nucleus. The process of copying a DNA gene
into mRNA is called transcription. Unlike DNA, mRNA moves out of
the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it directs the creation of a specific
protein.

 

Figure 5: DNA template and space for generating
the corresponding mRNA molecule according to the rules that follow.

 



Background

5.
A section of a DNA gene, 30 nucleotides long, is shown in Figure 5. It has
been split in half to fit on the page. Player 2 (RNA polymerase enzyme)
reads the DNA gene shown in Figure 5 and transcribes it into a mRNA message.
The mRNA is not identical to the DNA; it is complementary. This is almost
like translating the DNA into a code which is written in the mRNA. Figure
6 gives the rules for converting the language of DNA into the language of
mRNA.

 

Figure 6. Rules for converting DNA to RNA.
The U stands for uracil, a nucleotide which is only found in RNA. RNA contains
uracil in place of thymine, which occurs in DNA.

To Do

6.
Player 2 starts reading the DNA in Figure 5 and then writes the complementary
letter in the mRNA row below the DNA row. The first three nucleotides in
Figure 5 have been transcribed for you.



7.
When transcription is finished, Player 2 cuts out the newly formed strip
of mRNA from the page (leaving the DNA strip behind), and tapes the two
pieces together at the center to form one continuous strip. The strip is
moved out of the nucleus over to the ribosome, where it will direct the
synthesis of a protein. Your group only needs one copy of mRNA for the simulation.

 Background
 
8.
Look at the mRNA model you made with your group. Notice how the strip is
separated into sequences of three nucleotides; these are called codons.
Codons are like words; they call for one amino acid to be linked into a
growing protein chain. We will use only four different types of codons for
our simulation. These codons specify one of four kinds of amino acids (gumdrops)
to be placed in the protein model. Table 4 shows which gumdrop each of these
four codons specifies. (In real cells the mRNA contains 64 different codons.)

tRNAs and "amino acids"

 To Do
 
9.
The mRNA contains ten codons of four different types. On the mRNA model,
directly below each codon (in the bottom row labeled "AA" in Figure
5), Player 4 indicates which amino acid (gumdrop) is to be incorporated
into the protein chain using Table 4. The first amino acid has been indicated
in the mRNA model for you.



Exercise 6


Preparing tRNAs for Protein Synthesis

Background

1.
The function of tRNA is to pick up amino acids in the cytoplasm and to
align them on the ribosome in the order specified by the mRNA. Each type
of tRNA molecule carries only one specific kind of amino acid. At one end
of the tRNA molecule is a site where the amino acid is attached. On the
other end is a complementary site called an anticodon
which can recognize a specific mRNA codon.

Figure 6. Pipe Cleaner tRNA model

 



To Do

2.
Player 3 makes four different-colored tRNA models which can carry the four
types of amino acids to the ribosome. Player 3 bends four colored pipe cleaners
into the "cloverleaf" shape shown in Figure 6. This is approximately
the shape of all tRNA molecules in cells, (although each type has a different
sequence of nucleotides). An amino acid (gumdrop) matching the color of
the tRNA is attached by sticking the sharp end of the pipe cleaner into
the gumdrop. (Note: only tRNAs and amino acids of the same color are attached
together!).

 

Exercise 7

Protein Synthesis on the Ribosome

To Do

1.
The final step of protein synthesis requires the cooperation of both Player
3 (transfer RNA manager) and Player 4 (ribosome). Player 3 should have the
pipe cleaners, toothpicks, and gumdrops nearby.

Question

2.
A ribosome directs the creation of protein molecules. What are the subunits
of proteins?
 

Background

3.
Examine the ribosome model, noting its two distinct regions. One holds
the strip of mRNA, moving along it three nucleotides at a time. The other
region has two sites which can hold tRNA molecules.

Figure 7. Ribosome model.

 



To Do

4.
Player 4 cuts along the dotted lines in the two mRNA binding regions.



5.
Player 4 (ribosome) begins at the left-most codon on the mRNA strip.
Slide the ribosome onto the mRNA strip. Notice that the mRNA binding region
of the ribosome shows two codons through the cut-outs. Player 3 determines
which tRNA + amino acid should be shuttled to the mRNA to begin the protein
chain, and hands it to Player 4. Player 4 lines the appropriate tRNA up
with the first mRNA codon in the first site on the ribosome. Player 3 then
reads the second codon and identifies the second tRNA + amino acid and hands
it to Player 4. Player 4 lines it up with the second mRNA codon in the second
site on the ribosome (see Fig. 8).

Figure 8. Beginning protein synthesis.

 





6.
A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids which are held side
by side on the ribosome. Player 4 breaks a toothpick in half and uses it
to link the two gumdrops together. At the same time the peptide bond is
formed, Player 3 breaks the bond between the first amino acid and its tRNA
molecule by removing the end of the green pipe cleaner from the green gumdrop.

Figure 9. Peptide bond formation.

 



To Do

7.
The formation of a peptide bond requires an input of chemical energy.
From where might chemical energy which has been stored in the cell be obtained?
 
 

 Question
 
8.
The chocolate kiss represents the stored energy in the ATP molecule and
it is eaten or set aside as the energy is consumed to create a peptide bond.
*In reality, in your cells, the stored energy from a total of four ATP
molecules is required to form each peptide bond.

 To Do
 
9.
Player 4 moves the ribosome down the strip of mRNA so that the second codon
is now in the first ribosome site. The tRNA attached to the small amino
acid chain moves from the second binding site to the first binding site
when the ribosome moves along the mRNA strip. Player 3 moves the "empty"
tRNA back to the cytoplasm and "recharges it" (by attaching another
amino acid of the same color). This recharged tRNA will later carry another
amino acid to the ribosome.

Figure 10. tRNA leaves, ribosome moves
ahead one codon.

 



 
 
10.
Player 3 determines which tRNA with attached amino acid corresponds to
the third mRNA codon and brings it into position.

Figure 11. New tRNA enters ribosome.

 



 
 
11.
Player 4 then links the third amino acid to the second with a peptide
bond (toothpick) and simultaneously releases the white tRNA attached to
the second amino acid.

Figure 12. The second peptide bonds.

 



 
 
12.
All three amino acids are now attached to the third tRNA.

Figure 13. The "empty" tRNA leaves
the ribosome.

 



 
 
13.
Once a tRNA has released its amino acid to the growing protein chain, Player
3 moves it back to the cytoplasm where another amino acid is attached.

 
 
14.
The process of protein synthesis continues until the end of the mRNA is
reached. Your group will need more ATP to finish the protein. Player 1 "breaks
up" more glucose (cookies) as needed.

 
 
15.
Proteins fold up in unique ways. The shape they take dictates their chemical
properties and their function in the cell. Some proteins fold up in a long
spiral, kind of like a telephone cord. Others have a more irregular, globular
shape. You can try "folding" your protein as it is synthesized.

 
 
16.
When synthesis is complete, the protein is imported out of the cell and
can be consumed by hungry team members along with the other candy remnants.

 

Exercise 8
Connections and Review

Question 
 
1.
Protein synthesis is an exquisitely complex process that occurs very fast.
The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by information contained
in what molecules?

 
 
2.
Explain the flow of information involved in protein synthesis.
 

 
 
3.
How is it possible to store all the information needed to construct a
living thing in molecules having just four nucleotide bases?
 

 
 
4.
Where do all the enzymes involved in protein synthesis come from?

other parts of the cell.

Player 2 RNA Polymerase
In the nucleus, the RNA polymerase copies small segments of DNA to make
a complementary RNA molecule.
The copy, a "messenger" RNA molecule, leaves the nucleus and heads
to a ribosome.

Player 3 Transfer RNA(tRNA) Manager
In the cytoplasm, transfer RNA is linked to an amino acid. This requires
energy, usually provided by ATP. The transfer RNA then carries its attached
amino acid to the ribosome.

Player 4 Ribosome
Attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, the ribosome "reads" the
messenger RNA (mRNA) in three-letter "words," or codons.
A transfer RNA brings in an amino acid corresponding to each codon. The
amino acids are joined together into a chain with help from the ribosome.

Exercise 4


Harvesting Energy from Glucose in the Mitochondrion

To Do

1.
To start the simulation of the process of cellular respiration, Player 1
places the glucose molecules (cookies) in the mitochondrion and puts the
ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses) off to the side.



2.
Player 1 (mitochondrial "sugar splitting" enzymes) breaks a cookie
in half. This represents breaking the bonds which hold a glucose molecule
together. This process uses oxygen gas and releases carbon dioxide and water.

Question

3.
Does the breaking of chemical bonds in glucose release energy or consume
energy? Explain?
 

Background

4.
The cell stores some of the energy released from the bonds in glucose in
special bonds of ATP molecules. ATP is called the "universal energy
carrier of cells" because it can travel to other places in the cell
and provide energy for other chemical reactions (such as protein synthesis).

To Do

5.
Each time a cookie is broken in half, two ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses)
are produced. Player 1 breaks a cookie in half to produce two ATP molecules.

Then, he/she breaks the two halves in half again. This will break two
more bonds and produce four more Hershey's kisses, or six total ATP for
each glucose molecule.




6.
Player 1 now transports the six ATP molecules to the cytoplasm where they
will be used by other members of the group.

 

Exercise 5

Reading the Genetic Code in the Nucleus


Background

1.
Now that some cellular energy has been stored in ATP molecules, the next
stop is the nucleus, where a message will be created that can be sent out
to direct the creation of a protein.



2.
The DNA always remains in the nucleus, protected by the nuclear membrane
(except during cell division). The genetic "blueprints" for any
protein are found encoded in genes, which are sections of the DNA. DNA is
a nucleic acid and is composed of four types of molecules called nucleotides. We often use letters
to represent the four different types of nucleotide molecules.

A=adenine
  T=thymine
  C=cytosine
  G=guanine





3.
RNA is also a nucleic acid and are made of a long chain of nucleotides.
However, RNA does not contain thymine (T); it contains uracil (U), a similar
nucleotide, instead.



4.
One type of RNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA). It is a copy of a
DNA gene and it is made in the nucleus. The process of copying a DNA gene
into mRNA is called transcription. Unlike DNA, mRNA moves out of
the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it directs the creation of a specific
protein.

 

Figure 5: DNA template and space for generating
the corresponding mRNA molecule according to the rules that follow.

 



Background

5.
A section of a DNA gene, 30 nucleotides long, is shown in Figure 5. It has
been split in half to fit on the page. Player 2 (RNA polymerase enzyme)
reads the DNA gene shown in Figure 5 and transcribes it into a mRNA message.
The mRNA is not identical to the DNA; it is complementary. This is almost
like translating the DNA into a code which is written in the mRNA. Figure
6 gives the rules for converting the language of DNA into the language of
mRNA.

 

Figure 6. Rules for converting DNA to RNA.
The U stands for uracil, a nucleotide which is only found in RNA. RNA contains
uracil in place of thymine, which occurs in DNA.

To Do

6.
Player 2 starts reading the DNA in Figure 5 and then writes the complementary
letter in the mRNA row below the DNA row. The first three nucleotides in
Figure 5 have been transcribed for you.



7.
When transcription is finished, Player 2 cuts out the newly formed strip
of mRNA from the page (leaving the DNA strip behind), and tapes the two
pieces together at the center to form one continuous strip. The strip is
moved out of the nucleus over to the ribosome, where it will direct the
synthesis of a protein. Your group only needs one copy of mRNA for the simulation.

 Background
 
8.
Look at the mRNA model you made with your group. Notice how the strip is
separated into sequences of three nucleotides; these are called codons.
Codons are like words; they call for one amino acid to be linked into a
growing protein chain. We will use only four different types of codons for
our simulation. These codons specify one of four kinds of amino acids (gumdrops)
to be placed in the protein model. Table 4 shows which gumdrop each of these
four codons specifies. (In real cells the mRNA contains 64 different codons.)

 To Do
 
9.
The mRNA contains ten codons of four different types. On the mRNA model,
directly below each codon (in the bottom row labeled "AA" in Figure
5), Player 4 indicates which amino acid (gumdrop) is to be incorporated
into the protein chain using Table 4. The first amino acid has been indicated
in the mRNA model for you.



Exercise 6


Preparing tRNAs for Protein Synthesis

Background

1.
The function of tRNA is to pick up amino acids in the cytoplasm and to
align them on the ribosome in the order specified by the mRNA. Each type
of tRNA molecule carries only one specific kind of amino acid. At one end
of the tRNA molecule is a site where the amino acid is attached. On the
other end is a complementary site called an anticodon
which can recognize a specific mRNA codon.

Figure 6. Pipe Cleaner tRNA model

 



To Do

2.
Player 3 makes four different-colored tRNA models which can carry the four
types of amino acids to the ribosome. Player 3 bends four colored pipe cleaners
into the "cloverleaf" shape shown in Figure 6. This is approximately
the shape of all tRNA molecules in cells, (although each type has a different
sequence of nucleotides). An amino acid (gumdrop) matching the color of
the tRNA is attached by sticking the sharp end of the pipe cleaner into
the gumdrop. (Note: only tRNAs and amino acids of the same color are attached
together!).

 

Exercise 7

Protein Synthesis on the Ribosome

To Do

1.
The final step of protein synthesis requires the cooperation of both Player
3 (transfer RNA manager) and Player 4 (ribosome). Player 3 should have the
pipe cleaners, toothpicks, and gumdrops nearby.

Question

2.
A ribosome directs the creation of protein molecules. What are the subunits
of proteins?
 

Background

3.
Examine the ribosome model, noting its two distinct regions. One holds
the strip of mRNA, moving along it three nucleotides at a time. The other
region has two sites which can hold tRNA molecules.

Figure 7. Ribosome model.

 



To Do

4.
Player 4 cuts along the dotted lines in the two mRNA binding regions.



5.
Player 4 (ribosome) begins at the left-most codon on the mRNA strip.
Slide the ribosome onto the mRNA strip. Notice that the mRNA binding region
of the ribosome shows two codons through the cut-outs. Player 3 determines
which tRNA + amino acid should be shuttled to the mRNA to begin the protein
chain, and hands it to Player 4. Player 4 lines the appropriate tRNA up
with the first mRNA codon in the first site on the ribosome. Player 3 then
reads the second codon and identifies the second tRNA + amino acid and hands
it to Player 4. Player 4 lines it up with the second mRNA codon in the second
site on the ribosome (see Fig. 8).

Figure 8. Beginning protein synthesis.

 





6.
A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids which are held side
by side on the ribosome. Player 4 breaks a toothpick in half and uses it
to link the two gumdrops together. At the same time the peptide bond is
formed, Player 3 breaks the bond between the first amino acid and its tRNA
molecule by removing the end of the green pipe cleaner from the green gumdrop.

Figure 9. Peptide bond formation.

 



To Do

7.
The formation of a peptide bond requires an input of chemical energy.
From where might chemical energy which has been stored in the cell be obtained?
 
 

 Question
 
8.
The chocolate kiss represents the stored energy in the ATP molecule and
it is eaten or set aside as the energy is consumed to create a peptide bond.
*In reality, in your cells, the stored energy from a total of four ATP
molecules is required to form each peptide bond.

 To Do
 
9.
Player 4 moves the ribosome down the strip of mRNA so that the second codon
is now in the first ribosome site. The tRNA attached to the small amino
acid chain moves from the second binding site to the first binding site
when the ribosome moves along the mRNA strip. Player 3 moves the "empty"
tRNA back to the cytoplasm and "recharges it" (by attaching another
amino acid of the same color). This recharged tRNA will later carry another
amino acid to the ribosome.

Figure 10. tRNA leaves, ribosome moves
ahead one codon.

 



 
 
10.
Player 3 determines which tRNA with attached amino acid corresponds to
the third mRNA codon and brings it into position.

Figure 11. New tRNA enters ribosome.

 



 
 
11.
Player 4 then links the third amino acid to the second with a peptide
bond (toothpick) and simultaneously releases the white tRNA attached to
the second amino acid.

Figure 12. The second peptide bonds.

 



 
 
12.
All three amino acids are now attached to the third tRNA.

Figure 13. The "empty" tRNA leaves
the ribosome.

 



 
 
13.
Once a tRNA has released its amino acid to the growing protein chain, Player
3 moves it back to the cytoplasm where another amino acid is attached.

 
 
14.
The process of protein synthesis continues until the end of the mRNA is
reached. Your group will need more ATP to finish the protein. Player 1 "breaks
up" more glucose (cookies) as needed.

 
 
15.
Proteins fold up in unique ways. The shape they take dictates their chemical
properties and their function in the cell. Some proteins fold up in a long
spiral, kind of like a telephone cord. Others have a more irregular, globular
shape. You can try "folding" your protein as it is synthesized.

 
 
16.
When synthesis is complete, the protein is imported out of the cell and
can be consumed by hungry team members along with the other candy remnants.

 

Exercise 8
Connections and Review

Question 
 
1.
Protein synthesis is an exquisitely complex process that occurs very fast.
The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by information contained
in what molecules?

 
 
2.
Explain the flow of information involved in protein synthesis.
 

 
 
3.
How is it possible to store all the information needed to construct a
living thing in molecules having just four nucleotide bases?
 

 
 
4.
Where do all the enzymes involved in protein synthesis come from?

Chapter 5: THE LIVING ENVIRONMENT
Section C: Cells
Grade 3-5 Benchmark 1 of 2
Some living things consist of a single cell. Like familiar organisms, they
need food, water, and air; a way to dispose of waste; and an environment
they can live in.
Section C: Cells
Grade 6-8 Benchmark 1 of 4
All living things are composed of cells, from just one to many millions,
whose details usually are visible only through a microscope . Different
body tissues and organs are made up of different kinds of cells. The cells
in similar tissues and organs in other animals are similar to those in human
beings but differ somewhat from cells found in plants.
Section C: Cells
Grade 6-8 Benchmark 3 of 4
Within cells, many of the basic functions of organisms--such as extracting
energy from food and getting rid of waste--are carried out. The way in which
cells function is similar in all living organisms.
Section C: Cells
Grade 9-12 Benchmark 3 of 8
The work of the cell is carried out by the many different types of molecules
it assembles, mostly proteins. Protein molecules are long, usually folded
chains made from 20 different kinds of amino acid molecules. The function
of each protein molecule depends on its specific sequence of amino acids
and the shape the chain takes is a consequence of attractions between the
chain's parts.

Background
Information


Cells
According to the cell theory, proposed over 150 years ago:

All living things are composed of cells.
  All cells come from pre-existing cells.
  Cells are the smallest units of life.

Most cells are very, very small, so tiny that they can only be seen with
the aid of a microscope. Your body is composed of billions of cells! Within
your body, cells have different functions. We have blood cells, skin cells,
brain cells...the list goes on. Despite their differences, cells in living
organisms for the most part have similar structures and functions.

Question 
 
1.
Have you ever seen a cell? When? What do you remember about it?
 



Powerful Idea


Cells found in the animal and plant kingdoms (with just a few exceptions)
have these features in common:

cell membrane which serves as a boundary between the cell and
  the outside environment
  cytoplasm containing organelles
nucleus containing hereditary material (DNA)
  mitochondrion (plural, mitochondria), where cellular
  respiration takes place (the breakdown of sugars to produce energy
  for the cell, a process that uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and
  water)
  smooth endoplasmic reticulum where lipids are made
  rough endoplasmic reticulum where proteins are made with the
  help of ribosomes


Plant cells have, in addition to those components listed above, the
  following organelles


chloroplast which uses light energy to convert six carbon dioxide
  molecules into one organic six-carbon sugar
  cell wall outside
  the cell membrane which provides additional strength
  vacuole, a large organelle containing water, often with dissolved
  pigments, waste materials, or other substances


Cells come in many sizes and shapes, as illustrated in Figure 2a and
  b.

one or a few mitochondria in a cell, but cells actually contain many mitochondria,
sometimes 10,000 or more. Also, drawings are two-dimensional whereas cells
are three-dimensional.

How are plant cells different from animal cells? In what ways are they
similar?

easily? What sorts of substances do not pass through a membrane readily?
 



Exercise 2


Dynamic Cell Simulation Introduction


 Background

1.
Cells are constantly making and breaking down molecules of all types. Proteins
make up a diverse and important category of large biological molecules.
Proteins manage biochemical reactions, provide physical strength in cells,
aid in cell-to-cell communication, and many other tasks.



2.
Your group will go through a simplified simulation of how proteins are made
in the cell. The goal is to see the living cell as a site of constant metabolic
activity, not a motionless structure. Another goal is to appreciate how
the functions of different organelles are interconnected.



3.
Members of each lab group will perform different functions within the simulated
cell. The end result will be the production of a small protein.



Exercise 3


Simulation Set Up


 To Do

1.
Collect the materials for the lab. Table 1 summarizes what each item
represents in the simulation. Refer back to this table as needed during
the simulation.

cell cytoplasm

5 cookies
glucose molecules

10 Hershey's kisses
ATP molecules

10 colored gumdrops

5 toothpicks
peptide bonds

10 colored pipe cleaners
transfer RNAs





2.
Set up your cell. First, make models of organelles. One group member cuts
out the organelle models shown in Figure 4 from their handout. You only
need one set of organelles for each group. This simulation will only involve
two organelles: the mitochondrion and the nucleus; and a ribosome (which
is a structure, not an organelle).

Cell Simulation (not drawn to scale)

3.
Place the organelles on your desk or lab table. Pretend that your desk surface
is the cytoplasm of the cell and that the edges represent the cell membrane.



4.
Next, divide up the tasks. There will be four players. Table 2 describes
the different roles group members will play.

 

Table 2. Different roles of players in
the simulation.

Player 1 "Sugar Splitting" Enzymes

it to Player 4. Player 4 lines it up with the second mRNA codon in the second
site on the ribosome (see Fig. 8).

Figure 8. Beginning protein synthesis.

 





6.
A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids which are held side
by side on the ribosome. Player 4 breaks a toothpick in half and uses it
to link the two gumdrops together. At the same time the peptide bond is
formed, Player 3 breaks the bond between the first amino acid and its tRNA
molecule by removing the end of the green pipe cleaner from the green gumdrop.

Figure 9. Peptide bond formation.

 



To Do

7.
The formation of a peptide bond requires an input of chemical energy.
From where might chemical energy which has been stored in the cell be obtained?
 
 

 Question
 
8.
The chocolate kiss represents the stored energy in the ATP molecule and
it is eaten or set aside as the energy is consumed to create a peptide bond.
*In reality, in your cells, the stored energy from a total of four ATP
molecules is required to form each peptide bond.

 To Do
 
9.
Player 4 moves the ribosome down the strip of mRNA so that the second codon
is now in the first ribosome site. The tRNA attached to the small amino
acid chain moves from the second binding site to the first binding site
when the ribosome moves along the mRNA strip. Player 3 moves the "empty"
tRNA back to the cytoplasm and "recharges it" (by attaching another
amino acid of the same color). This recharged tRNA will later carry another
amino acid to the ribosome.

Figure 10. tRNA leaves, ribosome moves
ahead one codon.

 



 
 
10.
Player 3 determines which tRNA with attached amino acid corresponds to
the third mRNA codon and brings it into position.

Figure 11. New tRNA enters ribosome.

 



 
 
11.
Player 4 then links the third amino acid to the second with a peptide
bond (toothpick) and simultaneously releases the white tRNA attached to
the second amino acid.

Figure 12. The second peptide bonds.

 



 
 
12.
All three amino acids are now attached to the third tRNA.

Figure 13. The "empty" tRNA leaves
the ribosome.

 



 
 
13.
Once a tRNA has released its amino acid to the growing protein chain, Player
3 moves it back to the cytoplasm where another amino acid is attached.

 
 
14.
The process of protein synthesis continues until the end of the mRNA is
reached. Your group will need more ATP to finish the protein. Player 1 "breaks
up" more glucose (cookies) as needed.

 
 
15.
Proteins fold up in unique ways. The shape they take dictates their chemical
properties and their function in the cell. Some proteins fold up in a long
spiral, kind of like a telephone cord. Others have a more irregular, globular
shape. You can try "folding" your protein as it is synthesized.

 
 
16.
When synthesis is complete, the protein is imported out of the cell and
can be consumed by hungry team members along with the other candy remnants.

 

Exercise 8
Connections and Review

Question 
 
1.
Protein synthesis is an exquisitely complex process that occurs very fast.
The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by information contained
in what molecules?

 
 
2.
Explain the flow of information involved in protein synthesis.
 

 
 
3.
How is it possible to store all the information needed to construct a
living thing in molecules having just four nucleotide bases?
 

 
 
4.
Where do all the enzymes involved in protein synthesis come from?

Background
Information


Cells
According to the cell theory, proposed over 150 years ago:

All living things are composed of cells.
  All cells come from pre-existing cells.
  Cells are the smallest units of life.

Most cells are very, very small, so tiny that they can only be seen with
the aid of a microscope. Your body is composed of billions of cells! Within
your body, cells have different functions. We have blood cells, skin cells,
brain cells...the list goes on. Despite their differences, cells in living
organisms for the most part have similar structures and functions.

Question 
 
1.
Have you ever seen a cell? When? What do you remember about it?
 



Powerful Idea


Cells found in the animal and plant kingdoms (with just a few exceptions)
have these features in common:

cell membrane which serves as a boundary between the cell and
  the outside environment
  cytoplasm containing organelles
nucleus containing hereditary material (DNA)
  mitochondrion (plural, mitochondria), where cellular
  respiration takes place (the breakdown of sugars to produce energy
  for the cell, a process that uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and
  water)
  smooth endoplasmic reticulum where lipids are made
  rough endoplasmic reticulum where proteins are made with the
  help of ribosomes


Plant cells have, in addition to those components listed above, the
  following organelles


chloroplast which uses light energy to convert six carbon dioxide
  molecules into one organic six-carbon sugar
  cell wall outside
  the cell membrane which provides additional strength
  vacuole, a large organelle containing water, often with dissolved
  pigments, waste materials, or other substances


Cells come in many sizes and shapes, as illustrated in Figure 2a and
  b.

 Question
 
1.
What are the four classes of large organic molecules found in living
things?
 
 

 
 
2.
Name three inorganic molecules that commonly occur in living things.

 

 To Do
 
3.
Refer to a textbook to draw a simple diagram of an animal cell in the
template provided in Drawing 1. Draw to scale and label the following structures:


nucleus
mitochondrion

Drawing 2. Plant Cell

 



  To Notice
 
5.
Note that drawings can be misleading. For example, a drawing typically shows
one or a few mitochondria in a cell, but cells actually contain many mitochondria,
sometimes 10,000 or more. Also, drawings are two-dimensional whereas cells
are three-dimensional.

  To Do
 
6.
In your drawings, briefly note of the functions of each organelle.

  Question
 
7.
How are plant cells different from animal cells? In what ways are they
similar?
 

 
 
8.
Does cellular respiration occur in plant cells? Explain.
 

  Question
 
9.
What are the membranes in cells made of?

 
 
10.
Figure 3 shows a portion of a cell membrane. Label the parts of the molecules
shown.

Figure 3. Cell Membrane

 



 
 
11.
The cell membrane is selectively
permeable, allowing only certain substances from the outside environment
to enter the cell. What sorts of molecules pass through a phospholipid membrane
easily? What sorts of substances do not pass through a membrane readily?
 



Exercise 2


Dynamic Cell Simulation Introduction


 Background

1.
Cells are constantly making and breaking down molecules of all types. Proteins
make up a diverse and important category of large biological molecules.
Proteins manage biochemical reactions, provide physical strength in cells,
aid in cell-to-cell communication, and many other tasks.



2.
Your group will go through a simplified simulation of how proteins are made
in the cell. The goal is to see the living cell as a site of constant metabolic
activity, not a motionless structure. Another goal is to appreciate how
the functions of different organelles are interconnected.



3.
Members of each lab group will perform different functions within the simulated
cell. The end result will be the production of a small protein.



Exercise 3


Simulation Set Up


 To Do

1.
Collect the materials for the lab. Table 1 summarizes what each item
represents in the simulation. Refer back to this table as needed during
the simulation.

Table 1. Materials and cell structures
they represent.

Material:
Represents:

paper models
organelles

lab table or desktop
cell cytoplasm

5 cookies
glucose molecules

10 Hershey's kisses
ATP molecules

10 colored gumdrops
amino acids

5 toothpicks
peptide bonds

10 colored pipe cleaners
transfer RNAs





2.
Set up your cell. First, make models of organelles. One group member cuts
out the organelle models shown in Figure 4 from their handout. You only
need one set of organelles for each group. This simulation will only involve
two organelles: the mitochondrion and the nucleus; and a ribosome (which
is a structure, not an organelle).

 

Figure 4. Organelle Models for Dynamic
Cell Simulation (not drawn to scale)

 


Ribosome

 



 





3.
Place the organelles on your desk or lab table. Pretend that your desk surface
is the cytoplasm of the cell and that the edges represent the cell membrane.



4.
Next, divide up the tasks. There will be four players. Table 2 describes
the different roles group members will play.

 

Table 2. Different roles of players in
the simulation.

Player 1 "Sugar Splitting" Enzymes
In the cytoplasm and mitochondria, sugar-splitting enzymes break bonds in
sugar molecules to release stored energy. In the process, energy is captured
in the bonds of another molecule, ATP, which carries chemical energy to
other parts of the cell.

Player 2 RNA Polymerase
In the nucleus, the RNA polymerase copies small segments of DNA to make
a complementary RNA molecule.
The copy, a "messenger" RNA molecule, leaves the nucleus and heads
to a ribosome.

Player 3 Transfer RNA(tRNA) Manager
In the cytoplasm, transfer RNA is linked to an amino acid. This requires
energy, usually provided by ATP. The transfer RNA then carries its attached
amino acid to the ribosome.

Player 4 Ribosome
Attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, the ribosome "reads" the
messenger RNA (mRNA) in three-letter "words," or codons.
A transfer RNA brings in an amino acid corresponding to each codon. The
amino acids are joined together into a chain with help from the ribosome.



 Question
 
5.
What is an enzyme, anyway?
 
 



Exercise 4


Harvesting Energy from Glucose in the Mitochondrion

To Do

1.
To start the simulation of the process of cellular respiration, Player 1
places the glucose molecules (cookies) in the mitochondrion and puts the
ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses) off to the side.



2.
Player 1 (mitochondrial "sugar splitting" enzymes) breaks a cookie
in half. This represents breaking the bonds which hold a glucose molecule
together. This process uses oxygen gas and releases carbon dioxide and water.

Question

3.
Does the breaking of chemical bonds in glucose release energy or consume
energy? Explain?
 

Background

4.
The cell stores some of the energy released from the bonds in glucose in
special bonds of ATP molecules. ATP is called the "universal energy
carrier of cells" because it can travel to other places in the cell
and provide energy for other chemical reactions (such as protein synthesis).

To Do

5.
Each time a cookie is broken in half, two ATP molecules (Hershey's kisses)
are produced. Player 1 breaks a cookie in half to produce two ATP molecules.

Then, he/she breaks the two halves in half again. This will break two
more bonds and produce four more Hershey's kisses, or six total ATP for
each glucose molecule.




6.
Player 1 now transports the six ATP molecules to the cytoplasm where they
will be used by other members of the group.

 

Exercise 5

Reading the Genetic Code in the Nucleus


Background

1.
Now that some cellular energy has been stored in ATP molecules, the next
stop is the nucleus, where a message will be created that can be sent out
to direct the creation of a protein.



2.
The DNA always remains in the nucleus, protected by the nuclear membrane
(except during cell division). The genetic "blueprints" for any
protein are found encoded in genes, which are sections of the DNA. DNA is
a nucleic acid and is composed of four types of molecules called nucleotides. We often use letters
to represent the four different types of nucleotide molecules.

A=adenine
  T=thymine
  C=cytosine
  G=guanine





3.
RNA is also a nucleic acid and are made of a long chain of nucleotides.
However, RNA does not contain thymine (T); it contains uracil (U), a similar
nucleotide, instead.



4.
One type of RNA is called messenger RNA (mRNA). It is a copy of a
DNA gene and it is made in the nucleus. The process of copying a DNA gene
into mRNA is called transcription. Unlike DNA, mRNA moves out of
the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it directs the creation of a specific
protein.

 

Figure 5: DNA template and space for generating
the corresponding mRNA molecule according to the rules that follow.

 



Background

5.
A section of a DNA gene, 30 nucleotides long, is shown in Figure 5. It has
been split in half to fit on the page. Player 2 (RNA polymerase enzyme)
reads the DNA gene shown in Figure 5 and transcribes it into a mRNA message.
The mRNA is not identical to the DNA; it is complementary. This is almost
like translating the DNA into a code which is written in the mRNA. Figure
6 gives the rules for converting the language of DNA into the language of
mRNA.

 

Figure 6. Rules for converting DNA to RNA.
The U stands for uracil, a nucleotide which is only found in RNA. RNA contains
uracil in place of thymine, which occurs in DNA.

To Do

6.
Player 2 starts reading the DNA in Figure 5 and then writes the complementary
letter in the mRNA row below the DNA row. The first three nucleotides in
Figure 5 have been transcribed for you.



7.
When transcription is finished, Player 2 cuts out the newly formed strip
of mRNA from the page (leaving the DNA strip behind), and tapes the two
pieces together at the center to form one continuous strip. The strip is
moved out of the nucleus over to the ribosome, where it will direct the
synthesis of a protein. Your group only needs one copy of mRNA for the simulation.

 Background
 
8.
Look at the mRNA model you made with your group. Notice how the strip is
separated into sequences of three nucleotides; these are called codons.
Codons are like words; they call for one amino acid to be linked into a
growing protein chain. We will use only four different types of codons for
our simulation. These codons specify one of four kinds of amino acids (gumdrops)
to be placed in the protein model. Table 4 shows which gumdrop each of these
four codons specifies. (In real cells the mRNA contains 64 different codons.)

tRNAs and "amino acids"

 To Do
 
9.
The mRNA contains ten codons of four different types. On the mRNA model,
directly below each codon (in the bottom row labeled "AA" in Figure
5), Player 4 indicates which amino acid (gumdrop) is to be incorporated
into the protein chain using Table 4. The first amino acid has been indicated
in the mRNA model for you.



Exercise 6


Preparing tRNAs for Protein Synthesis

Background

1.
The function of tRNA is to pick up amino acids in the cytoplasm and to
align them on the ribosome in the order specified by the mRNA. Each type
of tRNA molecule carries only one specific kind of amino acid. At one end
of the tRNA molecule is a site where the amino acid is attached. On the
other end is a complementary site called an anticodon
which can recognize a specific mRNA codon.

Figure 6. Pipe Cleaner tRNA model

 



To Do

2.
Player 3 makes four different-colored tRNA models which can carry the four
types of amino acids to the ribosome. Player 3 bends four colored pipe cleaners
into the "cloverleaf" shape shown in Figure 6. This is approximately
the shape of all tRNA molecules in cells, (although each type has a different
sequence of nucleotides). An amino acid (gumdrop) matching the color of
the tRNA is attached by sticking the sharp end of the pipe cleaner into
the gumdrop. (Note: only tRNAs and amino acids of the same color are attached
together!).

 

Exercise 7

Protein Synthesis on the Ribosome

To Do

1.
The final step of protein synthesis requires the cooperation of both Player
3 (transfer RNA manager) and Player 4 (ribosome). Player 3 should have the
pipe cleaners, toothpicks, and gumdrops nearby.

Question

2.
A ribosome directs the creation of protein molecules. What are the subunits
of proteins?
 

Background

3.
Examine the ribosome model, noting its two distinct regions. One holds
the strip of mRNA, moving along it three nucleotides at a time. The other
region has two sites which can hold tRNA molecules.

Figure 7. Ribosome model.

 



To Do

4.
Player 4 cuts along the dotted lines in the two mRNA binding regions.



5.
Player 4 (ribosome) begins at the left-most codon on the mRNA strip.
Slide the ribosome onto the mRNA strip. Notice that the mRNA binding region
of the ribosome shows two codons through the cut-outs. Player 3 determines
which tRNA + amino acid should be shuttled to the mRNA to begin the protein
chain, and hands it to Player 4. Player 4 lines the appropriate tRNA up
with the first mRNA codon in the first site on the ribosome. Player 3 then
reads the second codon and identifies the second tRNA + amino acid and hands
it to Player 4. Player 4 lines it up with the second mRNA codon in the second
site on the ribosome (see Fig. 8).

Figure 8. Beginning protein synthesis.

 





6.
A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids which are held side
by side on the ribosome. Player 4 breaks a toothpick in half and uses it
to link the two gumdrops together. At the same time the peptide bond is
formed, Player 3 breaks the bond between the first amino acid and its tRNA
molecule by removing the end of the green pipe cleaner from the green gumdrop.

Figure 9. Peptide bond formation.

 



To Do

7.
The formation of a peptide bond requires an input of chemical energy.
From where might chemical energy which has been stored in the cell be obtained?
 
 

 Question
 
8.
The chocolate kiss represents the stored energy in the ATP molecule and
it is eaten or set aside as the energy is consumed to create a peptide bond.
*In reality, in your cells, the stored energy from a total of four ATP
molecules is required to form each peptide bond.

 To Do
 
9.
Player 4 moves the ribosome down the strip of mRNA so that the second codon
is now in the first ribosome site. The tRNA attached to the small amino
acid chain moves from the second binding site to the first binding site
when the ribosome moves along the mRNA strip. Player 3 moves the "empty"
tRNA back to the cytoplasm and "recharges it" (by attaching another
amino acid of the same color). This recharged tRNA will later carry another
amino acid to the ribosome.

Figure 10. tRNA leaves, ribosome moves
ahead one codon.

 



 
 
10.
Player 3 determines which tRNA with attached amino acid corresponds to
the third mRNA codon and brings it into position.

Figure 11. New tRNA enters ribosome.

 



 
 
11.
Player 4 then links the third amino acid to the second with a peptide
bond (toothpick) and simultaneously releases the white tRNA attached to
the second amino acid.

Figure 12. The second peptide bonds.

 



 
 
12.
All three amino acids are now attached to the third tRNA.

Figure 13. The "empty" tRNA leaves
the ribosome.

 



 
 
13.
Once a tRNA has released its amino acid to the growing protein chain, Player
3 moves it back to the cytoplasm where another amino acid is attached.

 
 
14.
The process of protein synthesis continues until the end of the mRNA is
reached. Your group will need more ATP to finish the protein. Player 1 "breaks
up" more glucose (cookies) as needed.

 
 
15.
Proteins fold up in unique ways. The shape they take dictates their chemical
properties and their function in the cell. Some proteins fold up in a long
spiral, kind of like a telephone cord. Others have a more irregular, globular
shape. You can try "folding" your protein as it is synthesized.

 
 
16.
When synthesis is complete, the protein is imported out of the cell and
can be consumed by hungry team members along with the other candy remnants.

Cells
According to the cell theory, proposed over 150 years ago:

All living things are composed of cells.
  All cells come from pre-existing cells.
  Cells are the smallest units of life.

Most cells are very, very small, so tiny that they can only be seen with
the aid of a microscope. Your body is composed of billions of cells! Within
your body, cells have different functions. We have blood cells, skin cells,
brain cells...the list goes on. Despite their differences, cells in living
organisms for the most part have similar structures and functions.Background

Powerful Idea


Cells found in the animal and plant kingdoms (with just a few exceptions)
have these features in common:

cell membrane which serves as a boundary between the cell and
  the outside environment
  cytoplasm containing organelles
nucleus containing hereditary material (DNA)
  mitochondrion (plural, mitochondria), where cellular
  respiration takes place (the breakdown of sugars to produce energy
  for the cell, a process that uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and
  water)
  smooth endoplasmic reticulum where lipids are made
  rough endoplasmic reticulum where proteins are made with the
  help of ribosomes


Plant cells have, in addition to those components listed above, the
  following organelles


chloroplast which uses light energy to convert six carbon dioxide
  molecules into one organic six-carbon sugar
  cell wall outside
  the cell membrane which provides additional strength
  vacuole, a large organelle containing water, often with dissolved
  pigments, waste materials, or other substances


Cells come in many sizes and shapes, as illustrated in Figure 2a and
  b.
