BackgroundInformation


Pattern Matching
Studying science is in many ways like piecing together a puzzle.  For this
reason, pattern matching is an important skill.  Biologists are constantly
looking for significant patterns in nature.  Even biological molecules are
pattern matchers.  Biological enzymes are a good example - each enzyme typically
recognizes one and only one type of molecule or pair of molecules.  

Table 1 reviews the CHNOPS atoms found in living organisms and some of their
properties. These atoms also occur in non-living things. As you work, notice if
the atoms in your molecules follow the indicated bonding patterns.

Exercise 1
Identifying Categories of Biological Molecules

Background Information


1.
The objects you will be sorting are basic building blocks
(subunits) of common macromolecules in living things.  Do
NOT refer to your books during this exercise.  Use your own
judgment in doing the sorting.

To Do

2.
Remove from your book the first five pages of molecules only
 (Part I, 5 pages)  Do not remove the second set of
unlabeled molecules (Part II) or the set of labeled molecules (Part III).




3.
Cut the one set of the unlabeled molecules (Part I) that you
have removed from your book.  Cut each page along the dividing lines to produce 9
cards per page for the first four pages  and 6 cards on the fifth page for a
total of 42 cards.  



4.
Organize the 42 cards into groups based upon structural similarities.  Pay special attention to: 

the elements (CHNOPS) in the molecule, 
		the shape of the molecule,
		patterns within the molecule, and 
		the ends of the molecule.  



Question

5.
How many groups of molecules do you have?  _____ Compare your categories with
those of your team mates.  

Describe

6.
In Table 2, describe each group of molecules and its distinguishing features.
 You will probably have five to eleven or so categories.  This table provides
spaces for up to eleven types.  Please do not feel any particular need to use all
eleven categories, and also feel free to create more categories if you feel it is
necessary.  Ignore the last column, 'Type of Molecules', until you get to

Exercise 2

Interpreting Molecular Structures

BackgroundInformation


Chemists and other scientists use a variety of representational
styles or conventions for drawing molecules, and they shift easily between them.


Review the following molecule descriptions with your peers, checking your groups
of molecules against the organizations here and at the same time (a) learn a bit
about how to read and interpret molecular formulas and (b) learn about the
different groups of organic molecules.

Group 1

Amino Acids - Building Blocks of Proteins


Background Information


1.
Amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins - molecules that play many important roles in the body
(including muscle structure, hormones,
antibodies, hemoglobin for carrying oxygen,
other transport proteins for carrying molecules across cell
membranes, toxins, and chemical messengers in
the nervous system). 


2.
Figure 1 shows a "generic" amino acid. Another (more compact) way to represent the same molecule is 
"NH3+ - CHR - COO-" or "NH3+ - CHR - COOH".
Figure 1. "Generic" Amino Acid




3.
The "-N-C-C-" in the center of the molecule is known as its
backbone  and is a defining feature of amino acids.  The
backbones are linked together in a linear chain when amino acids are combined to
form a protein.  A typical protein chain may contain 150 - 1000 or more amino
acids.
Figure 2.  Protein Backbone


Questions

4.
In Figure 3, below, which group is positively charged? ____  The charge
exists  because the nitrogen has formed four bonds instead of the usual three (a
covalent bond with carbon, a covalent bond with each of two hydrogen atoms, and a
hydrogen bond with a positively charged hydrogen ion).  The hydrogen ion is
easily lost and gained via dynamic transitions.  The "NH3+" group is
known as an amine group.



5.
Are the bonds between the nitrogen and the hydrogen atoms shown in Figure 1? 
____  Explain.



6.
In Figure 3, what atom is negatively charged? _____  The negative charge
arises when a hydroxyl group ("-OH") gives up a positively charged hydrogen atom
("H+"), leaving the negatively charged oxygen atom ("O-").  The entire group, "-
COOH" or "-COO-", is known as a carboxyl group.  The
amine and carboxyl groups and the
"N-C-C-" backbone are defining features of amino acids. 




7.
Are the bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms shown here? ____  Explain.



8.
Each amino acid has a different side group that is represented by "R" in
Figures 1 and 2.  Two amino acids with their particular side groups are shown
below. 
Figure 3.  Side Groups in Asparagine & Valine


To Do

9.
Draw three other amino acids below:  Look at Organic Molecules III to find
the name of each molecule and label accordingly.
Drawing 1.  Draw Three Additional Amino Acids

Acids in Your Molecule Set

 


Questions

13.
Can you name some amino acids you have heard of before and indicate where you heard of them?

18.
How many different proteins do you think can be built from this number of
subunits?  Explain your reasoning.




Group 2

Steroids - Type of Lipid
Multiple Ring Structures

Background Information


1.
Organic chemists use many shortcuts in drawing complex molecules.  They often
do not include the letter C for carbon, for example.  In the molecule below,
there is a carbon atom (not drawn in most cases) at every point of each of the
four rings and in the side chain.


2.
 Cholesterol, shown below, is a steroid. 
Steroids are one type of molecule in the class of compounds
known as lipids.  Cholesterol plays an important role in
membrane formation. 
Figure 4. Cholesterol


To Do

3.
The bonds between the carbons are shown.  In all but one case the carbon
atoms are connected to one another by a single bond (one pair of shared
electrons).  In one ring there are two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. 
Draw an arrow to point at the double bond in the drawing.



4.
To further simplify this drawing, none of the hydrogen atoms have been drawn.
 However, since you know that each carbon atom forms four bonds, you can fill in
all the missing hydrogen atoms.  Please do so now.

Question

5.
Several carbons in the molecule already have four bonds and so will have no
additional atoms (such as hydrogen) added.  How many of these did you find? 
_____ 

To Do

6.
Paste your steroids below, label each one by referring to part III, and draw
in the hydrogen atoms.  Compare your drawings with those of your
teammates.
Drawing 3.  Paste & Label Your Steroids

 




Group 3

Fatty Acids - Building Blocks of Fats and Oils
Long Hydrocarbon Chains

Background Information


1.
You should have some long hydrocarbon chains with a
carboxyl group at one end.  One of the defining features of
these hydrocarbon chains is the absence of oxygen except in one carboxyl group at
one end of the molecule.


2.
These hydrocarbon
chains are fatty
acids.  Fatty
acids are the building blocks of oils and
fats, which are also known as
lipids.  There are similarly,
two fatty acids in each of the
millions of phospholipids that make up your
cell membranes.
Figure 5.   Three Representations of a Fatty Acid (lauric acid)




3.
Fatty acids that contain no double bonds are saturated .  An unsaturated fatty acid contains one or more double bonds
(Figure 6).
Figure 6.  Unsaturated Fatty Acid (oleic acid)




4.
Fats are the most concentrated energy source in our diets, furnishing about
2.5 times the energy that sugar does, gram for gram.  We store energy for future
use in fats.  Fats also insulate and protect the body and many internal
organs.



5.
Fats make up about 40% of the American diet, although nutritionists recommend
no more than 30%.  Nutritionists also recommend lowering the proportion of
saturated fats and increasing the proportion of
polyunsaturated fats to reduce heart disease and
artherosclerosis. 

Question

6.
How many fatty acids do you have in your collection? ___  
		How many are saturated? ___  
		How many are monounsaturated? ___

To Do

7.
Paste your fatty acids below.  Label each fatty acid and underneath it draw
an alternative representation as shown in Figure 5 above.
Drawing 4.  Paste & Label Your Fatty Acids

 

Question

8.
Are fats and oils polar or non-polar? _________
Explain your reasoning.



9.
Are fatty acids, fats and oils water soluble?  Explain.

Review

10.
The membranes of cells and organelles are made of
phospholipids.  Phospholipids are amphipathic
molecules that have a polar phosphate group at one end and two non polar
fatty acids at the other, held together by a glycerol molecule.  Look at a
phospholipid in your book.




Group 4

Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates
Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates

Background Information


1.
Sugars are the building blocks of carbohydrates.  They are literally hydrates
of carbon, having the general formula
"Cn(H2O)n".  Sugars are burned (oxidized) to
release energy in cellular respiration and they play an
important role in homeostasis.  Your body maintains the level of
the sugar glucose in your blood within a very narrow range. 
Glucose is the immediate source of energy for your cells.




2.
Sugars occur as ring structures.  There are monosaccharides
(single rings), disaccharides (double rings), and larger.  In
solution, single rings can dynamically change from straight chains to rings and
back to straight chains.  A straight chain sugar is shown below
(Figure 6).  Notice that every carbon has an oxygen attached to it.
Figure 7. Straight Chain Representation of a Sugar (ribulose)



Question

3.
How many straight chain sugars do you have in your set?



4.
Are sugar molecules polar? ______  If so, what causes the polarity?



5.
Based on what you know so far, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in
sugars?  ______________ 



6.
How many single ring monosaccharides are in your molecule set?  _____  



7.
How many disaccharides are in your molecule set?  ____

To Do

8.
One of the disaccharides is common table sugar.  Draw its structure below.
Drawing 5.  Common table sugar (sucrose)
 

Background Information


9.
Sugars can be joined together in long chains to form macromolecules called
starch, cellulose, and
glycogen (animal starch).  Starch (in plants)
and glycogen (in animals) are easily broken down into sugars for
energy.  Cellulose, on the other hand, which is made in plants,
can be broken down only by a few organisms in the world (primarily the bacteria
in the guts of termites).  Yet all three types of macromolecules
are made of long chains of sugar, and cellulose differs only by a small change in
the connecting bond between each pair of sugars.

To Do

10.
In the space below, paste all your sugars, including straight chain
sugars, monosaccharides, and
disaccharides.  Label each molecule.
Drawing 6.  Sugars
 


Question

11.
Do all sugars have an oxygen attached to every carbon? __________




Group 5

Nucleic Acids
Single and Double Ring Molecules Containing Nitrogen

Background Information


1.
So far we have identified three of the four major classes of molecules in living things: 

proteins and their subunits amino acids,
lipids including fats and
oils with their subunits, fatty acids, and
steroids,
carbohydrates, including starch,
cellulose, and glycogen (animal starch) with
their subunits, sugars.





2.
Proteins, lipids and
carbohydrates are all recognized as major food groups as well as
major classes of molecules.  



3.
In contrast, nucleic acids, the fourth and last major group
of molecules, is not a major food group.  Nucleic acids include two kinds of
molecules, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), and their
subunits.



4.
In most organisms, DNA contains the genetic blueprint for
the organism and is reproduced in its entirety in every cell of its body. 
RNA helps to translate the information in DNA
into the production of thousands of different kinds of proteins,
which in turn control development of the organism.



5.
Each nucleotide or complete subunit of a nucleic acid has
three parts, a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon
sugar, and 1 to 3 phosphate groups (Figure
8).
Figure 8.  Parts of a Nucleotide (uracil triphosphate)





6.
The nitrogenous bases consist of single or double rings, and
each ring contains two nitrogens.  DNA contains four nitrogenous
bases: adenine (A) and guanine
(G), each with double rings, and cytosine 
(C), and thymine (T), with
single rings.  RNA contains three of these, A,
G, and C, and a fourth base,
uracil (U).



7.
How many nitrogenous bases do you have?  Paste and label them below.
Drawing 7.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Bases
 




8.
A nitrogenous base is combined with a five-carbon
sugar, either ribose (for RNA) or
deoxyribose (for DNA), as shown below. The arrows in Figure 9
point to the single structural difference between ribose and
deoxyribose.
Figure 9. Ribose and Deoxyribose


To Do

9.
How many molecules do you have that contain both a nitrogenous
base and a five-carbon sugar?  ____  These are called
nucleosides.  Paste and label them on the next
page.
Drawing 8.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Base & Sugar Molecules 
(nucleosides) Below
 



10.
Nucleosides can combine with one, two or three
phosphates.  The greater the number of phosphates, the greater
the energy contained in the molecule.  Adenine triphosphate
(ATP) is not only a major subunit of DNA and
RNA, but also is a major energy carrier in living systems.  How
many nitrogenous bases do you have that are combined with a
sugar and one or more phosphates?  _____  Paste and label them
below.

Drawing 9.  Paste & Label
Nucleoside Mono-, Di-, & Triphosphates Below
 




11.
In summary, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in nucleic acids? _____________________ 



12.
The nucleotides from which nucleic acids are synthesized contain what three
parts?  _____________________ _____________________ _____________________




13.
The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 								 




14.
The four nitrogenous bases in RNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 																		 





Exercise 3
Summary



1.
Organic molecules are carbon-based, whereas
inorganic molecules are not.

Predict

2.
There are four major classes of organic:

proteins - the workhorses (enzymes, hormones, carriers, etc.) of the cells
lipids - energy storage & protection, hormones, cholesterol , phospholipids (membrane structure)
carbohydrates - energy carriers, structural units
nucleic acids - genetic information

    Spindle Fibers, etc.  
Lipids Fatty Acids Steroids CHO
  Glycerol Oils

Carbohydrates Sugars Starches CHO 
    Cellulose  
Nucleic Acids Nucleotides DNA, RNA CHONP




3.
Each class of macromolecules is built up from subunits. 
Except for cellulose, they are easily assembled and
disassembled.




4.
One type of subunit can be converted into another through biochemical
reactions in the body.



5.
Function follows structure.  A small change in structure can lead to a
big change in function.



6.
The elements in living things, including CHNOPS and about 25 others, all
occur in the non-living as well as the living world.  Carbon, for example, is
found in diamonds and graphite, carbon dioxide, and gasoline as well as living
things.




7.
Life is highly organized.  Organization requires a continuous investment of
energy.  Energy is stored in the bonds of molecules.  Each type of bond contains
a different amount of energy (Table 4).




8.
The body manages energy carefully, transferring it from one molecule to
another, driving synthetic reactions with it, making changes in small incremental
steps, and releasing some energy as heat.

You should have some long hydrocarbon chains with a
carboxyl group at one end.  One of the defining features of
these hydrocarbon chains is the absence of oxygen except in one carboxyl group at
one end of the molecule.


2.
These hydrocarbon
chains are fatty
acids.  Fatty
acids are the building blocks of oils and
fats, which are also known as
lipids.  There are similarly,
two fatty acids in each of the
millions of phospholipids that make up your
cell membranes.
Figure 5.   Three Representations of a Fatty Acid (lauric acid)




3.
Fatty acids that contain no double bonds are saturated .  An unsaturated fatty acid contains one or more double bonds
(Figure 6).
Figure 6.  Unsaturated Fatty Acid (oleic acid)




4.
Fats are the most concentrated energy source in our diets, furnishing about
2.5 times the energy that sugar does, gram for gram.  We store energy for future
use in fats.  Fats also insulate and protect the body and many internal
organs.



5.
Fats make up about 40% of the American diet, although nutritionists recommend
no more than 30%.  Nutritionists also recommend lowering the proportion of
saturated fats and increasing the proportion of
polyunsaturated fats to reduce heart disease and
artherosclerosis. 

Question

6.
How many fatty acids do you have in your collection? ___  
		How many are saturated? ___  
		How many are monounsaturated? ___

Explain your reasoning.



9.
Are fatty acids, fats and oils water soluble?  Explain.

Review

10.
The membranes of cells and organelles are made of
phospholipids.  Phospholipids are amphipathic
molecules that have a polar phosphate group at one end and two non polar
fatty acids at the other, held together by a glycerol molecule.  Look at a
phospholipid in your book.

Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates
Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates

Background Information


1.
Sugars are the building blocks of carbohydrates.  They are literally hydrates
of carbon, having the general formula
"Cn(H2O)n".  Sugars are burned (oxidized) to
release energy in cellular respiration and they play an
important role in homeostasis.  Your body maintains the level of
the sugar glucose in your blood within a very narrow range. 
Glucose is the immediate source of energy for your cells.




2.
Sugars occur as ring structures.  There are monosaccharides
(single rings), disaccharides (double rings), and larger.  In
solution, single rings can dynamically change from straight chains to rings and
back to straight chains.  A straight chain sugar is shown below
(Figure 6).  Notice that every carbon has an oxygen attached to it.
Figure 7. Straight Chain Representation of a Sugar (ribulose)



Question

3.
How many straight chain sugars do you have in your set?



4.
Are sugar molecules polar? ______  If so, what causes the polarity?



5.
Based on what you know so far, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in
sugars?  ______________ 



6.
How many single ring monosaccharides are in your molecule set?  _____  



7.
How many disaccharides are in your molecule set?  ____

To Do

8.
One of the disaccharides is common table sugar.  Draw its structure below.
Drawing 5.  Common table sugar (sucrose)
 

Background Information


9.
Sugars can be joined together in long chains to form macromolecules called
starch, cellulose, and
glycogen (animal starch).  Starch (in plants)
and glycogen (in animals) are easily broken down into sugars for
energy.  Cellulose, on the other hand, which is made in plants,
can be broken down only by a few organisms in the world (primarily the bacteria
in the guts of termites).  Yet all three types of macromolecules
are made of long chains of sugar, and cellulose differs only by a small change in
the connecting bond between each pair of sugars.

To Do

10.
In the space below, paste all your sugars, including straight chain
sugars, monosaccharides, and
disaccharides.  Label each molecule.

11.
Do all sugars have an oxygen attached to every carbon? __________




Group 5

Nucleic Acids
Single and Double Ring Molecules Containing Nitrogen

Background Information


1.
So far we have identified three of the four major classes of molecules in living things: 

proteins and their subunits amino acids,
lipids including fats and
oils with their subunits, fatty acids, and
steroids,
carbohydrates, including starch,
cellulose, and glycogen (animal starch) with
their subunits, sugars.





2.
Proteins, lipids and
carbohydrates are all recognized as major food groups as well as
major classes of molecules.  



3.
In contrast, nucleic acids, the fourth and last major group
of molecules, is not a major food group.  Nucleic acids include two kinds of
molecules, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), and their
subunits.



4.
In most organisms, DNA contains the genetic blueprint for
the organism and is reproduced in its entirety in every cell of its body. 
RNA helps to translate the information in DNA
into the production of thousands of different kinds of proteins,
which in turn control development of the organism.



5.
Each nucleotide or complete subunit of a nucleic acid has
three parts, a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon
sugar, and 1 to 3 phosphate groups (Figure
8).
Figure 8.  Parts of a Nucleotide (uracil triphosphate)





6.
The nitrogenous bases consist of single or double rings, and
each ring contains two nitrogens.  DNA contains four nitrogenous
bases: adenine (A) and guanine
(G), each with double rings, and cytosine 
(C), and thymine (T), with
single rings.  RNA contains three of these, A,
G, and C, and a fourth base,
uracil (U).



7.
How many nitrogenous bases do you have?  Paste and label them below.
Drawing 7.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Bases
 




8.
A nitrogenous base is combined with a five-carbon
sugar, either ribose (for RNA) or
deoxyribose (for DNA), as shown below. The arrows in Figure 9
point to the single structural difference between ribose and
deoxyribose.
Figure 9. Ribose and Deoxyribose


To Do

9.
How many molecules do you have that contain both a nitrogenous
base and a five-carbon sugar?  ____  These are called
nucleosides.  Paste and label them on the next
page.
Drawing 8.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Base & Sugar Molecules 
(nucleosides) Below
 



10.
Nucleosides can combine with one, two or three
phosphates.  The greater the number of phosphates, the greater
the energy contained in the molecule.  Adenine triphosphate
(ATP) is not only a major subunit of DNA and
RNA, but also is a major energy carrier in living systems.  How
many nitrogenous bases do you have that are combined with a
sugar and one or more phosphates?  _____  Paste and label them
below.

BackgroundInformation


Pattern Matching
Studying science is in many ways like piecing together a puzzle.  For this
reason, pattern matching is an important skill.  Biologists are constantly
looking for significant patterns in nature.  Even biological molecules are
pattern matchers.  Biological enzymes are a good example - each enzyme typically
recognizes one and only one type of molecule or pair of molecules.  

Table 1 reviews the CHNOPS atoms found in living organisms and some of their
properties. These atoms also occur in non-living things. As you work, notice if
the atoms in your molecules follow the indicated bonding patterns.

Exercise 1
Identifying Categories of Biological Molecules

Background Information


1.
The objects you will be sorting are basic building blocks
(subunits) of common macromolecules in living things.  Do
NOT refer to your books during this exercise.  Use your own
judgment in doing the sorting.

To Do

2.
Remove from your book the first five pages of molecules only
 (Part I, 5 pages)  Do not remove the second set of
unlabeled molecules (Part II) or the set of labeled molecules (Part III).




3.
Cut the one set of the unlabeled molecules (Part I) that you
have removed from your book.  Cut each page along the dividing lines to produce 9
cards per page for the first four pages  and 6 cards on the fifth page for a
total of 42 cards.  



4.
Organize the 42 cards into groups based upon structural similarities.  Pay special attention to: 

the elements (CHNOPS) in the molecule, 
		the shape of the molecule,
		patterns within the molecule, and 
		the ends of the molecule.  



Question

5.
How many groups of molecules do you have?  _____ Compare your categories with
those of your team mates.  

Describe

6.
In Table 2, describe each group of molecules and its distinguishing features.
 You will probably have five to eleven or so categories.  This table provides
spaces for up to eleven types.  Please do not feel any particular need to use all
eleven categories, and also feel free to create more categories if you feel it is
necessary.  Ignore the last column, 'Type of Molecules', until you get to

Exercise 2

Interpreting Molecular Structures

BackgroundInformation


Chemists and other scientists use a variety of representational
styles or conventions for drawing molecules, and they shift easily between them.


Review the following molecule descriptions with your peers, checking your groups
of molecules against the organizations here and at the same time (a) learn a bit
about how to read and interpret molecular formulas and (b) learn about the
different groups of organic molecules.

Group 1

Amino Acids - Building Blocks of Proteins


Background Information


1.
Amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins - molecules that play many important roles in the body
(including muscle structure, hormones,
antibodies, hemoglobin for carrying oxygen,
other transport proteins for carrying molecules across cell
membranes, toxins, and chemical messengers in
the nervous system). 


2.
Figure 1 shows a "generic" amino acid. Another (more compact) way to represent the same molecule is 
"NH3+ - CHR - COO-" or "NH3+ - CHR - COOH".
Figure 1. "Generic" Amino Acid




3.
The "-N-C-C-" in the center of the molecule is known as its
backbone  and is a defining feature of amino acids.  The
backbones are linked together in a linear chain when amino acids are combined to
form a protein.  A typical protein chain may contain 150 - 1000 or more amino
acids.
Figure 2.  Protein Backbone


Questions

4.
In Figure 3, below, which group is positively charged? ____  The charge
exists  because the nitrogen has formed four bonds instead of the usual three (a
covalent bond with carbon, a covalent bond with each of two hydrogen atoms, and a
hydrogen bond with a positively charged hydrogen ion).  The hydrogen ion is
easily lost and gained via dynamic transitions.  The "NH3+" group is
known as an amine group.



5.
Are the bonds between the nitrogen and the hydrogen atoms shown in Figure 1? 
____  Explain.



6.
In Figure 3, what atom is negatively charged? _____  The negative charge
arises when a hydroxyl group ("-OH") gives up a positively charged hydrogen atom
("H+"), leaving the negatively charged oxygen atom ("O-").  The entire group, "-
COOH" or "-COO-", is known as a carboxyl group.  The
amine and carboxyl groups and the
"N-C-C-" backbone are defining features of amino acids. 




7.
Are the bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms shown here? ____  Explain.



8.
Each amino acid has a different side group that is represented by "R" in
Figures 1 and 2.  Two amino acids with their particular side groups are shown
below. 
Figure 3.  Side Groups in Asparagine & Valine

acids?  _____________  In addition, two important amino acids,
methionine and cysteine, also contain
sulfur and can be phosphorylated. 



15.

section? _____________  



16.
What are the subunits or building blocks of this class of molecules?  _____________

18.
How many different proteins do you think can be built from this number of
subunits?  Explain your reasoning.




Group 2

Steroids - Type of Lipid
Multiple Ring Structures

Background Information


1.
Organic chemists use many shortcuts in drawing complex molecules.  They often
do not include the letter C for carbon, for example.  In the molecule below,
there is a carbon atom (not drawn in most cases) at every point of each of the
four rings and in the side chain.


2.
 Cholesterol, shown below, is a steroid. 
Steroids are one type of molecule in the class of compounds
known as lipids.  Cholesterol plays an important role in
membrane formation. 
Figure 4. Cholesterol


To Do

3.
The bonds between the carbons are shown.  In all but one case the carbon
atoms are connected to one another by a single bond (one pair of shared
electrons).  In one ring there are two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. 
Draw an arrow to point at the double bond in the drawing.



4.
To further simplify this drawing, none of the hydrogen atoms have been drawn.
 However, since you know that each carbon atom forms four bonds, you can fill in
all the missing hydrogen atoms.  Please do so now.

Question

5.
Several carbons in the molecule already have four bonds and so will have no
additional atoms (such as hydrogen) added.  How many of these did you find?

BackgroundInformation


Pattern Matching
Studying science is in many ways like piecing together a puzzle.  For this
reason, pattern matching is an important skill.  Biologists are constantly
looking for significant patterns in nature.  Even biological molecules are
pattern matchers.  Biological enzymes are a good example - each enzyme typically
recognizes one and only one type of molecule or pair of molecules.  

Table 1 reviews the CHNOPS atoms found in living organisms and some of their
properties. These atoms also occur in non-living things. As you work, notice if
the atoms in your molecules follow the indicated bonding patterns.

Exercise 1
Identifying Categories of Biological Molecules

Background Information


1.
The objects you will be sorting are basic building blocks
(subunits) of common macromolecules in living things.  Do
NOT refer to your books during this exercise.  Use your own
judgment in doing the sorting.

To Do

2.
Remove from your book the first five pages of molecules only
 (Part I, 5 pages)  Do not remove the second set of
unlabeled molecules (Part II) or the set of labeled molecules (Part III).




3.
Cut the one set of the unlabeled molecules (Part I) that you
have removed from your book.  Cut each page along the dividing lines to produce 9
cards per page for the first four pages  and 6 cards on the fifth page for a
total of 42 cards.  



4.
Organize the 42 cards into groups based upon structural similarities.  Pay special attention to: 

the elements (CHNOPS) in the molecule, 
		the shape of the molecule,
		patterns within the molecule, and 
		the ends of the molecule.  



Question

5.
How many groups of molecules do you have?  _____ Compare your categories with
those of your team mates.  

Describe

6.
In Table 2, describe each group of molecules and its distinguishing features.
 You will probably have five to eleven or so categories.  This table provides
spaces for up to eleven types.  Please do not feel any particular need to use all
eleven categories, and also feel free to create more categories if you feel it is
necessary.  Ignore the last column, 'Type of Molecules', until you get to

Exercise 2

Interpreting Molecular Structures

BackgroundInformation


Chemists and other scientists use a variety of representational
styles or conventions for drawing molecules, and they shift easily between them.


Review the following molecule descriptions with your peers, checking your groups
of molecules against the organizations here and at the same time (a) learn a bit
about how to read and interpret molecular formulas and (b) learn about the
different groups of organic molecules.

Group 1

Amino Acids - Building Blocks of Proteins


Background Information


1.
Amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins - molecules that play many important roles in the body
(including muscle structure, hormones,
antibodies, hemoglobin for carrying oxygen,
other transport proteins for carrying molecules across cell
membranes, toxins, and chemical messengers in
the nervous system). 


2.
Figure 1 shows a "generic" amino acid. Another (more compact) way to represent the same molecule is 
"NH3+ - CHR - COO-" or "NH3+ - CHR - COOH".
Figure 1. "Generic" Amino Acid




3.
The "-N-C-C-" in the center of the molecule is known as its
backbone  and is a defining feature of amino acids.  The
backbones are linked together in a linear chain when amino acids are combined to
form a protein.  A typical protein chain may contain 150 - 1000 or more amino
acids.
Figure 2.  Protein Backbone


Questions

4.
In Figure 3, below, which group is positively charged? ____  The charge
exists  because the nitrogen has formed four bonds instead of the usual three (a
covalent bond with carbon, a covalent bond with each of two hydrogen atoms, and a
hydrogen bond with a positively charged hydrogen ion).  The hydrogen ion is
easily lost and gained via dynamic transitions.  The "NH3+" group is
known as an amine group.



5.
Are the bonds between the nitrogen and the hydrogen atoms shown in Figure 1? 
____  Explain.



6.
In Figure 3, what atom is negatively charged? _____  The negative charge
arises when a hydroxyl group ("-OH") gives up a positively charged hydrogen atom
("H+"), leaving the negatively charged oxygen atom ("O-").  The entire group, "-
COOH" or "-COO-", is known as a carboxyl group.  The
amine and carboxyl groups and the
"N-C-C-" backbone are defining features of amino acids. 




7.
Are the bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms shown here? ____  Explain.



8.
Each amino acid has a different side group that is represented by "R" in
Figures 1 and 2.  Two amino acids with their particular side groups are shown
below. 
Figure 3.  Side Groups in Asparagine & Valine


To Do

9.
Draw three other amino acids below:  Look at Organic Molecules III to find
the name of each molecule and label accordingly.
Drawing 1.  Draw Three Additional Amino Acids

11.
Can you name three different functions performed by proteins in your body?

To Do

12.

Acids in Your Molecule Set

 


Questions

13.
Can you name some amino acids you have heard of before and indicate where you heard of them?

18.
How many different proteins do you think can be built from this number of
subunits?  Explain your reasoning.




Group 2

Steroids - Type of Lipid
Multiple Ring Structures

Background Information


1.
Organic chemists use many shortcuts in drawing complex molecules.  They often
do not include the letter C for carbon, for example.  In the molecule below,
there is a carbon atom (not drawn in most cases) at every point of each of the
four rings and in the side chain.


2.
 Cholesterol, shown below, is a steroid. 
Steroids are one type of molecule in the class of compounds
known as lipids.  Cholesterol plays an important role in
membrane formation. 
Figure 4. Cholesterol


To Do

3.
The bonds between the carbons are shown.  In all but one case the carbon
atoms are connected to one another by a single bond (one pair of shared
electrons).  In one ring there are two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. 
Draw an arrow to point at the double bond in the drawing.



4.
To further simplify this drawing, none of the hydrogen atoms have been drawn.
 However, since you know that each carbon atom forms four bonds, you can fill in
all the missing hydrogen atoms.  Please do so now.

Question

5.
Several carbons in the molecule already have four bonds and so will have no
additional atoms (such as hydrogen) added.  How many of these did you find? 
_____ 

To Do

6.
Paste your steroids below, label each one by referring to part III, and draw
in the hydrogen atoms.  Compare your drawings with those of your
teammates.
Drawing 3.  Paste & Label Your Steroids

 




Group 3

Fatty Acids - Building Blocks of Fats and Oils
Long Hydrocarbon Chains

Background Information


1.
You should have some long hydrocarbon chains with a
carboxyl group at one end.  One of the defining features of
these hydrocarbon chains is the absence of oxygen except in one carboxyl group at
one end of the molecule.


2.
These hydrocarbon
chains are fatty
acids.  Fatty
acids are the building blocks of oils and
fats, which are also known as
lipids.  There are similarly,
two fatty acids in each of the
millions of phospholipids that make up your
cell membranes.
Figure 5.   Three Representations of a Fatty Acid (lauric acid)




3.
Fatty acids that contain no double bonds are saturated .  An unsaturated fatty acid contains one or more double bonds
(Figure 6).
Figure 6.  Unsaturated Fatty Acid (oleic acid)




4.
Fats are the most concentrated energy source in our diets, furnishing about
2.5 times the energy that sugar does, gram for gram.  We store energy for future
use in fats.  Fats also insulate and protect the body and many internal
organs.



5.
Fats make up about 40% of the American diet, although nutritionists recommend
no more than 30%.  Nutritionists also recommend lowering the proportion of
saturated fats and increasing the proportion of
polyunsaturated fats to reduce heart disease and
artherosclerosis. 

Question

6.
How many fatty acids do you have in your collection? ___  
		How many are saturated? ___  
		How many are monounsaturated? ___

To Do

7.
Paste your fatty acids below.  Label each fatty acid and underneath it draw
an alternative representation as shown in Figure 5 above.
Drawing 4.  Paste & Label Your Fatty Acids

 

Question

8.
Are fats and oils polar or non-polar? _________
Explain your reasoning.



9.
Are fatty acids, fats and oils water soluble?  Explain.

Review

10.
The membranes of cells and organelles are made of
phospholipids.  Phospholipids are amphipathic
molecules that have a polar phosphate group at one end and two non polar
fatty acids at the other, held together by a glycerol molecule.  Look at a
phospholipid in your book.




Group 4

Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates
Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates

Background Information


1.
Sugars are the building blocks of carbohydrates.  They are literally hydrates
of carbon, having the general formula
"Cn(H2O)n".  Sugars are burned (oxidized) to
release energy in cellular respiration and they play an
important role in homeostasis.  Your body maintains the level of
the sugar glucose in your blood within a very narrow range. 
Glucose is the immediate source of energy for your cells.




2.
Sugars occur as ring structures.  There are monosaccharides
(single rings), disaccharides (double rings), and larger.  In
solution, single rings can dynamically change from straight chains to rings and
back to straight chains.  A straight chain sugar is shown below
(Figure 6).  Notice that every carbon has an oxygen attached to it.
Figure 7. Straight Chain Representation of a Sugar (ribulose)



Question

3.
How many straight chain sugars do you have in your set?



4.
Are sugar molecules polar? ______  If so, what causes the polarity?



5.
Based on what you know so far, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in
sugars?  ______________ 



6.
How many single ring monosaccharides are in your molecule set?  _____  



7.
How many disaccharides are in your molecule set?  ____

To Do

8.
One of the disaccharides is common table sugar.  Draw its structure below.
Drawing 5.  Common table sugar (sucrose)
 

Background Information


9.
Sugars can be joined together in long chains to form macromolecules called
starch, cellulose, and
glycogen (animal starch).  Starch (in plants)
and glycogen (in animals) are easily broken down into sugars for
energy.  Cellulose, on the other hand, which is made in plants,
can be broken down only by a few organisms in the world (primarily the bacteria
in the guts of termites).  Yet all three types of macromolecules
are made of long chains of sugar, and cellulose differs only by a small change in
the connecting bond between each pair of sugars.

To Do

10.
In the space below, paste all your sugars, including straight chain
sugars, monosaccharides, and
disaccharides.  Label each molecule.
Drawing 6.  Sugars
 


Question

11.
Do all sugars have an oxygen attached to every carbon? __________




Group 5

Nucleic Acids
Single and Double Ring Molecules Containing Nitrogen

Background Information


1.
So far we have identified three of the four major classes of molecules in living things: 

proteins and their subunits amino acids,
lipids including fats and
oils with their subunits, fatty acids, and
steroids,
carbohydrates, including starch,
cellulose, and glycogen (animal starch) with
their subunits, sugars.





2.
Proteins, lipids and
carbohydrates are all recognized as major food groups as well as
major classes of molecules.  



3.
In contrast, nucleic acids, the fourth and last major group
of molecules, is not a major food group.  Nucleic acids include two kinds of
molecules, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), and their
subunits.



4.
In most organisms, DNA contains the genetic blueprint for
the organism and is reproduced in its entirety in every cell of its body. 
RNA helps to translate the information in DNA
into the production of thousands of different kinds of proteins,
which in turn control development of the organism.



5.
Each nucleotide or complete subunit of a nucleic acid has
three parts, a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon
sugar, and 1 to 3 phosphate groups (Figure
8).
Figure 8.  Parts of a Nucleotide (uracil triphosphate)





6.
The nitrogenous bases consist of single or double rings, and
each ring contains two nitrogens.  DNA contains four nitrogenous
bases: adenine (A) and guanine
(G), each with double rings, and cytosine 
(C), and thymine (T), with
single rings.  RNA contains three of these, A,
G, and C, and a fourth base,
uracil (U).



7.
How many nitrogenous bases do you have?  Paste and label them below.
Drawing 7.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Bases
 




8.
A nitrogenous base is combined with a five-carbon
sugar, either ribose (for RNA) or
deoxyribose (for DNA), as shown below. The arrows in Figure 9
point to the single structural difference between ribose and
deoxyribose.
Figure 9. Ribose and Deoxyribose


To Do

9.
How many molecules do you have that contain both a nitrogenous
base and a five-carbon sugar?  ____  These are called
nucleosides.  Paste and label them on the next
page.
Drawing 8.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Base & Sugar Molecules 
(nucleosides) Below
 



10.
Nucleosides can combine with one, two or three
phosphates.  The greater the number of phosphates, the greater
the energy contained in the molecule.  Adenine triphosphate
(ATP) is not only a major subunit of DNA and
RNA, but also is a major energy carrier in living systems.  How
many nitrogenous bases do you have that are combined with a
sugar and one or more phosphates?  _____  Paste and label them
below.

Drawing 9.  Paste & Label
Nucleoside Mono-, Di-, & Triphosphates Below
 




11.
In summary, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in nucleic acids? _____________________ 



12.
The nucleotides from which nucleic acids are synthesized contain what three
parts?  _____________________ _____________________ _____________________




13.
The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 								 




14.
The four nitrogenous bases in RNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 																		 





Exercise 3
Summary



1.
Organic molecules are carbon-based, whereas
inorganic molecules are not.

Predict

2.
There are four major classes of organic:

proteins - the workhorses (enzymes, hormones, carriers, etc.) of the cells
lipids - energy storage & protection, hormones, cholesterol , phospholipids (membrane structure)
carbohydrates - energy carriers, structural units
nucleic acids - genetic information

    Spindle Fibers, etc.  
Lipids Fatty Acids Steroids CHO
  Glycerol Oils
Waxes  
Carbohydrates Sugars Starches CHO 
    Cellulose  
Nucleic Acids Nucleotides DNA, RNA CHONP




3.
Each class of macromolecules is built up from subunits. 
Except for cellulose, they are easily assembled and
disassembled.




4.
One type of subunit can be converted into another through biochemical
reactions in the body.



5.
Function follows structure.  A small change in structure can lead to a
big change in function.



6.
The elements in living things, including CHNOPS and about 25 others, all
occur in the non-living as well as the living world.  Carbon, for example, is
found in diamonds and graphite, carbon dioxide, and gasoline as well as living
things.




7.
Life is highly organized.  Organization requires a continuous investment of
energy.  Energy is stored in the bonds of molecules.  Each type of bond contains
a different amount of energy (Table 4).




8.
The body manages energy carefully, transferring it from one molecule to
another, driving synthetic reactions with it, making changes in small incremental
steps, and releasing some energy as heat.

Group 3

Fatty Acids - Building Blocks of Fats and Oils
Long Hydrocarbon Chains

Background Information


1.
You should have some long hydrocarbon chains with a
carboxyl group at one end.  One of the defining features of
these hydrocarbon chains is the absence of oxygen except in one carboxyl group at
one end of the molecule.


2.
These hydrocarbon
chains are fatty
acids.  Fatty
acids are the building blocks of oils and
fats, which are also known as
lipids.  There are similarly,
two fatty acids in each of the
millions of phospholipids that make up your
cell membranes.
Figure 5.   Three Representations of a Fatty Acid (lauric acid)




3.
Fatty acids that contain no double bonds are saturated .  An unsaturated fatty acid contains one or more double bonds
(Figure 6).
Figure 6.  Unsaturated Fatty Acid (oleic acid)




4.
Fats are the most concentrated energy source in our diets, furnishing about
2.5 times the energy that sugar does, gram for gram.  We store energy for future
use in fats.  Fats also insulate and protect the body and many internal
organs.



5.
Fats make up about 40% of the American diet, although nutritionists recommend
no more than 30%.  Nutritionists also recommend lowering the proportion of
saturated fats and increasing the proportion of
polyunsaturated fats to reduce heart disease and
artherosclerosis. 

Question

6.
How many fatty acids do you have in your collection? ___  
		How many are saturated? ___  
		How many are monounsaturated? ___

To Do

7.
Paste your fatty acids below.  Label each fatty acid and underneath it draw
an alternative representation as shown in Figure 5 above.
Drawing 4.  Paste & Label Your Fatty Acids

 

Question

8.
Are fats and oils polar or non-polar? _________
Explain your reasoning.



9.
Are fatty acids, fats and oils water soluble?  Explain.

Review

10.
The membranes of cells and organelles are made of
phospholipids.  Phospholipids are amphipathic
molecules that have a polar phosphate group at one end and two non polar
fatty acids at the other, held together by a glycerol molecule.  Look at a
phospholipid in your book.




Group 4

Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates
Sugars - Building Blocks of Carbohydrates

Background Information


1.
Sugars are the building blocks of carbohydrates.  They are literally hydrates
of carbon, having the general formula
"Cn(H2O)n".  Sugars are burned (oxidized) to
release energy in cellular respiration and they play an
important role in homeostasis.  Your body maintains the level of
the sugar glucose in your blood within a very narrow range. 
Glucose is the immediate source of energy for your cells.




2.
Sugars occur as ring structures.  There are monosaccharides
(single rings), disaccharides (double rings), and larger.  In
solution, single rings can dynamically change from straight chains to rings and
back to straight chains.  A straight chain sugar is shown below
(Figure 6).  Notice that every carbon has an oxygen attached to it.
Figure 7. Straight Chain Representation of a Sugar (ribulose)



Question

3.
How many straight chain sugars do you have in your set?



4.
Are sugar molecules polar? ______  If so, what causes the polarity?



5.
Based on what you know so far, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in
sugars?  ______________ 



6.
How many single ring monosaccharides are in your molecule set?  _____  



7.
How many disaccharides are in your molecule set?  ____

To Do

8.
One of the disaccharides is common table sugar.  Draw its structure below.
Drawing 5.  Common table sugar (sucrose)
 

Background Information


9.
Sugars can be joined together in long chains to form macromolecules called
starch, cellulose, and
glycogen (animal starch).  Starch (in plants)
and glycogen (in animals) are easily broken down into sugars for
energy.  Cellulose, on the other hand, which is made in plants,
can be broken down only by a few organisms in the world (primarily the bacteria
in the guts of termites).  Yet all three types of macromolecules
are made of long chains of sugar, and cellulose differs only by a small change in
the connecting bond between each pair of sugars.

To Do

10.
In the space below, paste all your sugars, including straight chain
sugars, monosaccharides, and
disaccharides.  Label each molecule.
Drawing 6.  Sugars
 


Question

11.
Do all sugars have an oxygen attached to every carbon? __________




Group 5

Nucleic Acids
Single and Double Ring Molecules Containing Nitrogen

Background Information


1.
So far we have identified three of the four major classes of molecules in living things: 

proteins and their subunits amino acids,
lipids including fats and
oils with their subunits, fatty acids, and
steroids,
carbohydrates, including starch,
cellulose, and glycogen (animal starch) with
their subunits, sugars.





2.
Proteins, lipids and
carbohydrates are all recognized as major food groups as well as
major classes of molecules.  



3.
In contrast, nucleic acids, the fourth and last major group
of molecules, is not a major food group.  Nucleic acids include two kinds of
molecules, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), and their
subunits.



4.
In most organisms, DNA contains the genetic blueprint for
the organism and is reproduced in its entirety in every cell of its body. 
RNA helps to translate the information in DNA
into the production of thousands of different kinds of proteins,
which in turn control development of the organism.



5.
Each nucleotide or complete subunit of a nucleic acid has
three parts, a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon
sugar, and 1 to 3 phosphate groups (Figure
8).
Figure 8.  Parts of a Nucleotide (uracil triphosphate)





6.
The nitrogenous bases consist of single or double rings, and
each ring contains two nitrogens.  DNA contains four nitrogenous
bases: adenine (A) and guanine
(G), each with double rings, and cytosine 
(C), and thymine (T), with
single rings.  RNA contains three of these, A,
G, and C, and a fourth base,
uracil (U).



7.
How many nitrogenous bases do you have?  Paste and label them below.
Drawing 7.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Bases
 




8.
A nitrogenous base is combined with a five-carbon
sugar, either ribose (for RNA) or
deoxyribose (for DNA), as shown below. The arrows in Figure 9
point to the single structural difference between ribose and
deoxyribose.
Figure 9. Ribose and Deoxyribose


To Do

9.
How many molecules do you have that contain both a nitrogenous
base and a five-carbon sugar?  ____  These are called
nucleosides.  Paste and label them on the next
page.
Drawing 8.  Paste & Label
Nitrogenous Base & Sugar Molecules 
(nucleosides) Below
 



10.
Nucleosides can combine with one, two or three
phosphates.  The greater the number of phosphates, the greater
the energy contained in the molecule.  Adenine triphosphate
(ATP) is not only a major subunit of DNA and
RNA, but also is a major energy carrier in living systems.  How
many nitrogenous bases do you have that are combined with a
sugar and one or more phosphates?  _____  Paste and label them
below.

Nucleoside Mono-, Di-, & Triphosphates Below
 




11.
In summary, which of the CHNOPS elements are contained in nucleic acids? _____________________ 



12.
The nucleotides from which nucleic acids are synthesized contain what three
parts?  _____________________ _____________________ _____________________




13.
The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 								 




14.
The four nitrogenous bases in RNA are: ____________ ____________  ____________  ____________ 																		 





Exercise 3
Summary



1.
Organic molecules are carbon-based, whereas
inorganic molecules are not.

Predict

2.
There are four major classes of organic:

proteins - the workhorses (enzymes, hormones, carriers, etc.) of the cells
lipids - energy storage & protection, hormones, cholesterol , phospholipids (membrane structure)
carbohydrates - energy carriers, structural units
nucleic acids - genetic information

3.
Each class of macromolecules is built up from subunits. 
Except for cellulose, they are easily assembled and
disassembled.




4.
One type of subunit can be converted into another through biochemical
reactions in the body.



5.
Function follows structure.  A small change in structure can lead to a
big change in function.



6.
The elements in living things, including CHNOPS and about 25 others, all
occur in the non-living as well as the living world.  Carbon, for example, is
found in diamonds and graphite, carbon dioxide, and gasoline as well as living
things.




7.
Life is highly organized.  Organization requires a continuous investment of
energy.  Energy is stored in the bonds of molecules.  Each type of bond contains
a different amount of energy (Table 4).




8.
The body manages energy carefully, transferring it from one molecule to
another, driving synthetic reactions with it, making changes in small incremental
steps, and releasing some energy as heat.

Pattern Matching
Studying science is in many ways like piecing together a puzzle.  For this
reason, pattern matching is an important skill.  Biologists are constantly
looking for significant patterns in nature.  Even biological molecules are
pattern matchers.  Biological enzymes are a good example - each enzyme typically
recognizes one and only one type of molecule or pair of molecules.  

Table 1 reviews the CHNOPS atoms found in living organisms and some of their
properties. These atoms also occur in non-living things. As you work, notice if
the atoms in your molecules follow the indicated bonding patterns.
