He bought ZX Spectrum what his ship was docking in Canada, along with Kempston joystick and three game cassettes and smuggled it to Poland (it was also illegal to purchase and bring and goods from western countries to Poland)... Later I learnt the ZX was worth his monthly salary but my father wanted his children (me and my little brother who was 1 yo then) to have a chance to experience this new digital magic... And boy it was magic... we didn't get it really and the games were really hard and we were *trying* to play those (I remember when I was 5 or 6 when I realized what that Jetpack is all about:)... but imagine the whole grey communistic country when you are getting limits to buy meat and bread in the shops (people were standing in 12hour lines for those)... where you cannot travel and [have only a] pale idea what computers are... and two small kids and their father loading this cassette that bring colourful magic to them... I really don't understand why people are comparing the R-PI to the spectrum, the Spectrum was a machine with a very basic operating system that you could play games on (although I understand that the popularity of it being a games machine irked Clive Sinclair a lot) The spectrum was a very basic machine that only had a few games when it first came out (Horace goes skiing, chequered flag). We're just telling our kids it's for their education, but really it's just for us to play games on ;) The key difference is the R-PI is aimed at being a learning tool used in schools, so it's much more akin to the BBC Micro rather than the spectrum.
