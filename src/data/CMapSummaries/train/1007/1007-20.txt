Fears and Phobias
A phobia is an extreme fear of something that may pose little or no actual danger to you in real life. Common phobias and fears include closed-in places, heights, motorway driving, flying insects, snakes, spiders, and needles. However, we can have phobias of almost anything.
Just thinking about the thing you fear can make you anxious. And, when you are exposed to your phobia, the terror is automatic and overwhelming. Phobias can last a lifetime, partly because people with phobias make so much effort avoiding the object.
Most phobias are learnt in childhood, but they can also be created in adults. They may relate directly to the trigger, i.e. being bitten by a dog brings a fear of dogs, or they may have a more indirect route, i .e. having a bad experience whilst being stood next to a red car may trigger a phobia of red cars. Phobias can also be learned by watching other people's reactions to an object.
Hypnotherapy is effective at helping you to overcome your fear by treating the anxiety caused by the trigger, and by re-training the mind to remember the original trigger in a way that does not create anxiety.  During your therapy session, you will:
  Discover the negative emotional drivers that keep your fear or phobia alive
  Learn how to dismiss and rid yourself of negative thoughts
  Learn how to create a more powerful supporting belief and learn to desentisize yourself to fear
