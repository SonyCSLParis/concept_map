Created and developed by creative genius Dr Richard Bandler and John Grinder back in the 1970's, NLP removes the need for months or even years of counselling or psychotherapy to get rid of a problem by using a variety of linguistic techniques to re-program the brain within just one or a few sessions. In simple terms, NLP is learning how to learn. You want to be able to remove whatever it is that's holding you back so that you can move on and live your life how you want, rather than being controlled by a fear, phobia, addiction, bad memory etc.
