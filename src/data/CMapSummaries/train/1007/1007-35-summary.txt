A phobia is an irrational and excessive fear, which is cued by the anticipation or presence of a specific object or situation (e.g. flying, heights, seeing blood or receiving an injection). For example, it is quite common for people who have flown for many years without problems, to spontaneously develop a fear of flying which significantly impacts their professional and personal lives. Other phobias (situational types) are triggered by specific situations, such as traveling on public transport.
