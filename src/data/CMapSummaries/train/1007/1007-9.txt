How it Works: Getting Over Phobia of Getting Old
It comes down to redirecting your unconscious mind . On the surface, you know your phobia of getting old is illogical. But it has persisted because your subconscious has linked a whole load of powerful negative emotions - mainly fear - to the very thought of old age.
