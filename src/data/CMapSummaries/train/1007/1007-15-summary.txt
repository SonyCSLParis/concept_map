This is effective because it is far more difficult for the unconscious mind to resist suggestions set in a dialogue, than direct post-hypnotic suggestions that are apparent to the mind. Ericksonian hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques work more effectively than conventional hypnosis programs because they are not phobia specific; they can be used to cure any phobia, or even multiple phobias. The techniques found in Ericksonian hypnosis and NLP are successful treatments for many fears and anxiety disorders.
