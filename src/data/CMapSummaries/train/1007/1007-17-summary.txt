Because of the link between eating and being sick, the sufferer tends to be a little obsessive about what and where they will eat. A lot of sufferers tend to view being sick as 'horrible, dirty, yukky' etc, and so it is quite common for emetophobics to also have fears of other situations where they might feel the same way; going to the toilet (number twos), or the inability to urinate in front of others (shy bladder), or even just being a little bit sweaty. Some symptoms that may appear alongside (or be caused by) social phobia or social anxiety are..... A fear of public speaking A fear of talking on the telephone A fear of writing in front of someone (even signing a cheque!)
