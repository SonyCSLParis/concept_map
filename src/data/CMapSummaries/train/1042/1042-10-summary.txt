Religious Education 1. Religious education at this level should be concerned with laying the foundations to enable children to develop attitudes towards all faiths and belief systems based on appreciation, interest and respect (Paragraph 3.22); - The development of religious education at primary level, especially with regard to broadening the syllabus to encompass a multi-faith perspective, can be facilitated by the designation of a teacher to coordinate work in this field (paragraph 3.23); - We believe that religious education can play a central role in preparing all pupils for life in today's multi-racial Britain, and can also lead them to a greater understanding of the diversity of the global community (Paragraph 5.1); - Religious education can also contribute towards challenging and countering the influence of racism in our society (Paragraph 5.1); - There should be no conflict between the role of the schools in providing religious education and the role of community institutions in providing religious instruction (Paragraph 5.2); - Given the multiplicity of beliefs now present in society, it is not surprising that we have received much evidence about the difficulties generated by the requirement in the 1944 Act for a daily act of collective worship and the provision of a particular form of religious education; [page 519] - We therefore believe that the Government, in consultation with religious and educational bodies, should look afresh at the relevant provisions of the Act to see whether alterations are called for after an interval of 40 years. Subject as hereinafter provided, the collective worship required by subsection (1) of the last foregoing section shall not, in any county school, be distinctive of any particular religious denomination, and the religious instruction given to any pupils in attendance at a county school in conformity with the requirements of subsection (2) of the said section shall be given in accordance with an agreed syllabus adopted for the school or for those pupils and shall not include any catechism or formulary which is distinctive of any particular religious denomination: Provided that, where a county secondary school is so situated that arrangements cannot conveniently be made for the withdrawal of pupils from the school in accordance with the provisions of this Act to receive religious instruction elsewhere, then, if the local education authority are satisfied: (a) that the parents of pupils in attendance at the school desire them to receive religious instruction in the school in accordance with the tenets of a particular religious denomination; and (b) the satisfactory arrangements have been made for the provision of such instruction to those pupils in the school and for securing that the cost of providing such instruction to those pupils in the school will not fall upon the authority; the authority shall, unless they are satisfied that owing to any special circumstances it would be unreasonable so to do, provide facilities for the carrying out of those arrangements Special provisions as to religious education in controlled schools 27.
