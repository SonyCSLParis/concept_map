As partners in your child's faith formation let us work together to reecho the love and Word of God to the children of this generation and this parish. A minimum of two years preparation is required for the reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist and High School Confirmation. Age appropriate discussion regarding the readings and an opportunity for prayer is the format used during the Children's Liturgy of the Word.
