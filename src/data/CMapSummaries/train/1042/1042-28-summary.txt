Religious Education classes (seven levels) are offered for children three years old through high school at 11:15 AM on Sunday mornings. Children in Kindergarten through 3 years old and up attend the first part of the 11:15 AM Sunday morning worship. We ask that parents fill out a visitor form on the first visit and register their children in our program on the third visit.
