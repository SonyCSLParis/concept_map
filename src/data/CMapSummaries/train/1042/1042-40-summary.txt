Parent-teacher conferences are a great way to discuss how parents and teachers can work together to help students perform at their best in school. Some additional things to keep in mind to discuss with the teacher: Questions about progress How you, the teacher, and the school can work together to help your child Questions about the school's programs or policies Your child's home life, personality, concerns, habits and hobbies, and other things you feel the teacher should know about that might help in working with your child (e.g. transitioning to a new school, parent deployed, part-time jobs, a sick relative, religious holidays, music lessons, etc.). Ask the teacher to work with you on finding a solution that will work for you, your child and the teacher.
