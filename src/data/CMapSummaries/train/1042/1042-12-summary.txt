It amounts to the preaching of a particular form of Christianity to our youngest and most impressionable children regardless of the beliefs of their parents or the children's ethnic or religious backgrounds. If special religious instruction is given in a Government school during the hours set apart for the instruction of the students- the persons providing the special religious instruction must be persons who are accredited representatives of churches or other religious groups and who are approved by the Minister for the purpose; the special religious instruction must be given on the basis of the normal class organisation of the school except in a school where the Minister authorises some other basis to be observed having regard to- the particular circumstances of a school or schools; or the preparation or conduct of a pageant, special event or celebration of a festival in a school or schools; attendance for the special religious instruction is not to be compulsory for any student whose parents desire that he or she be excused from attending. I am quite happy for those who wish their child to have a religious education, whatever that religion may be, to have access to their faith, however I do feel that the best qualified people to do this are the parents themselves and the leaders of the parents' church/faith.
