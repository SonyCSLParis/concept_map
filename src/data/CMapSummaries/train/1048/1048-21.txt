Toddler and Preschool-2 curriculums have interesting weekly themes. Every week a new topic such as bugs, dinosaurs, zoo animals, shapes, farm animals, etc is introduced to the class. Simple learning activities and worksheets are provided to the students according to the level of the students.
Toddler Program
Students need to complete 18 months to join this program. Students need not be potty trained to enroll to this program. The class is setup for a small group of 12 students with age appropriate activities. Teacher to student ratio is 1:6.
Our toddler group has a separate play yard where they get to play outside twice a day. Our toddlers have a structured program with plenty of freedom to explore and socialize with friends. Their day is busy with arts and craft activities, songs and movements, story time, group activities and much more.
Once a toddler in this program reaches 24 months, at the request of parents we can move the toddler to the Preschool-2 program or extend the child's stay in the toddler program until the child is 36 months.
Preschool-2 Program
Students need to complete 2 years to join this program. Students need not be potty trained to enroll to this program. We assist the students with potty training without any additional charge.
The classroom is set for 24 students with teacher to student ratio of 1:8. We offer a structured program with a variety of fun activities to keep our twos busy. They are introduced to a few Montessori practical life activities, letters and sounds, counting activities, music movement, crafts and much more.
