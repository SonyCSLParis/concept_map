Potty training requires a great deal of patience, and setbacks often happen. Many children begin potty training between 18 to 24 months of age; however, it's not uncommon for a child to still be in diapers at three years of age. This is an important stage in your child's development. Be sure to show kindness, love, support and respect as your child moves out of diapers. Praise your child when the job is done correctly!
Tips on starting potty training
Be sure now is a good time to potty train your child. Begin potty training when you are ready to devote the time and energy to encourage your child on a daily basis for at least three months.
Watch for signs that your child is ready. When your child is ready, he will signal that his diaper is wet or soiled or will tell you that he would like to go to the potty.
Let your child explore. Introduce your child to the bathroom and make his time there comfortable. Let him practice flushing the toilet and sitting on the potty.
Keep it positive. Tell your child that the potty chair is his own chair. And never force your child to sit on the chair. Stay with your child when he is on the potty chair. Reading or talking to your child when he is sitting on the potty may help your child relax.
Help your child make the connection. Place your child on the potty chair whenever he signals the need to go to the bathroom so he'll associate the potty with the urge to go.
Regularly go to the potty. In addition to watching for signals that your child needs to urinate or have a bowel movement, place your child on the potty at regular intervals. This may be as often as every 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Reinforce success. Praise your child when he goes to the bathroom in the potty chair, but do not express disappointment if your child does not urinate or have a bowel movement in the potty. Be patient with your child.
