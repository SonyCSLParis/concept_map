Many schools even have a time when you can bring your child with you to visit. In addition to consulting preschool and kindergarten teachers, you could also ask your child's pediatrician if he or she thinks your child is ready for kindergarten. While it is never too late for you to sign your child up for kindergarten in a public school, you should still try to attend meetings and pick up forms to find out about the process and important dates.
