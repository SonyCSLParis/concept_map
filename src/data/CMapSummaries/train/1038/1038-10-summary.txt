At a glance Children may enrol in Kindergarten at the beginning of the school year if they turn five years of age on or before 31 July in that year. They need to be five by the end of July, or they can hold off starting school until their sixth year. Teachers are trained to teach children at the age level in which they come in, but the choice is up to parents whether they feel that their child should start at four-and-a-half or six.
