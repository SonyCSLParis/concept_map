And even in the school districts where a child doesn't have to be 5 to start kindergarten, some parents are voluntarily delaying for a year the entrance of later-born children. "Studies have shown that older is better, that the children who are least successful are the youngest in their class," says Cynthia Bing, co-head of the School Advisory program for New York City's Parents League. "If so many children aren't ready for kindergarten, that proves that kindergartens are out of whack and off kilter with children of that age."
