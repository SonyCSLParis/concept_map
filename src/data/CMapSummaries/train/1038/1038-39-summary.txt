If after the first few days, you have questions or concerns that are not addressed do speak to your child's teacher so issues can be ironed out. Try to collect your child from school, at least for the first few days; it's a good way to meet other parents and to gauge how your child feels at the end of the day. If you have concerns that your child is at the wrong school or your child (or you haven't yet started the process) check out our section on Choosing A School.
