For some people it's not a problem that their baby wakes but if it is a problem for you it might help to try to work out why your child is waking up. Talk to your child about the SATs to see if they are worried too and reassure them that they should just try their best and you'll be happy with that. It's also important to talk to your child and see if they can tell you what is worrying them, but it's better not to link this to the bed wetting as it may make them more anxious.
