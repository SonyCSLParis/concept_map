Here is a simple list of basic skills that could benefit your child when starting to school (this is not a developmental checklist). When you are choosing a school for your child it's probably best to look for one in your local area, so it's closer to home (it will make it a lot easier for you). So whether you are sending your child to a public or private school, in the end they are all taught the same.
