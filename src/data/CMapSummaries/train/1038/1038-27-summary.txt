The same goes for your child The primary goal of a first time kids lesson is to get your child to have fun on the mountain, so let your child choose what sport to take up. When your child is sick or when s/he did not get a good night's sleep, don't put your child in Ski &amp; Ride School; reschedule the lesson for another day when the experience can be more fun. No one is up for learning when s/he is sick and we want your child to be able to have a good time in his/her lesson.
