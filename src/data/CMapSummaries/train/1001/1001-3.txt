A Popular alternative Treatment for ADHD is Behavior Modification
ADHD Behavior modification works by rewarding desired behavior with privileges or rewards while discouraging bad behavior with removal of privileges or adding appropriate punishment. Most of these systems use a computerized scoring program, scheduling software and tapes. By letting the parent create a list of behaviors they consider to be undesirable the child will receive negative scores. If the child behaves well by performing their chores with good behavior this counts towards a positive score.
At the end of a week or month the child will be given a score that will determine what reward or punishment they will receive. The advantage of systems like these is they build the child's self esteem and accountability because they ultimately have a hand in their outcome. One example of this type of system is the Stress Free ADHD System.
