And it is usually easy to spot children who will become shy, as they don't get over the normal stranger and separation anxiety of early childhood. Shyness is likely to be normal if your child is otherwise growing and developing normally and: he is mostly shy in new situations and around new people, but eventually warms up after he has been around a person for a while he has problems in larger group settings, but does well in smaller groups of people he is eventually able to make some friends Shyness can be a problem if you think that it is interfering with your child's ability to make friends or if you think that he won't be able to do well in school. When setting up playdates or activities, you might try to plan them at your own home, so that your child doesn't have the added stress of being in a new environment.
