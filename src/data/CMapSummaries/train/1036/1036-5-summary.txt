The First Day of School for My Children Wednesday, December 26, 2007 Mr Abdul Rahim B with his wife and children. As my children had attended pre-school, the first day of primary school was rather a non-event for the kids. To me, it could be because the kids had not attended pre-school or they were trying to get attention.
