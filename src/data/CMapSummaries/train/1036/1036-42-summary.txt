At the meeting, Lopez said parents expressed that they wanted their kids "to learn to read [Bengali] and to see it as a language that they're proud of and want to be able to retain." At one of the first meetings parents had with MWSCC, back in March, another parent, Nozrul Khan, said his child is now shy about speaking Bengali and that the school system should help by reinforcing it. The program is for all Bangladeshi children, whether their primary language is Bengali or English.
