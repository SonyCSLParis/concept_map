The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers Gentle Ways to Stop Bedtime Battles and Improve Your Child's Sleep
READ WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS SAY
"In this excellent companion to her 2002 parenting classic, The No-Cry Sleep Solution, Pantley debunks many myths about children and sleep. She provides a plethora of examples about how perfectly natural it is for toddlers and preschoolers to have sleep issues. However, parents will be thrilled to hear that just because something is normal doesn't mean they have to live with it. She addresses problems and solutions for a wide variety of sleep-related issues. This is hope condensed for the tired parent; essential for all public libraries."
~ Kari Ramstrom, MLIS, A starred review, The Library Journal, May, 2005
"One frustrating aspect of being a Pediatrician is that it is often hard to give thorough advice for parenting problems in a short office visit. Elizabeth Pantley has once again provided me with a quick and helpful solution - writing a prescription to read The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers ."
~Vincent Iannelli, MD, Pediatrician, President of www.keepkidshealthy.com , author of The Everything Father's First Year Book, and father of twin toddlers

" The No-Cry Sleep Solution is a welcome alternative to the "cry it out" advice to sleep problems. A crying child is a child in need, and leaving him or her alone to cry to sleep is not responding to the child's need or solving any sleep problems. The No-Cry Sleep Solution makes sense and is a child friendly - and family friendly - approach to sleep problems, something we have been in search of for a long time." ~Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC,  Author of The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers: The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solution Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Expert in North America
"Real solutions for real people, Elizabeth Pantley has done it again. As a physician and a parent there are no other resources that I recommend as highly or as often as Mrs. Pantley's books on parenting. Finally parents will have the tools necessary to successfully nurture and guide their children (and themselves) sensibly and sanely to a good nights rest." ~Marianne Pinkston M.D., Family Practitioner (and parent of previously sleepless children), San Antonio, TX
