Too Little Sleep in Preschool Years May Predict ADHD Study suggests link between behavior in kindergarten and sleep loss earlier in life By Mary Elizabeth Dallas TUESDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- Preschoolers who don't get enough sleep are more likely than other children to be hyperactive and inattentive by the time they reach kindergarten, according to a new study. However, inattention and hyperactivity in the preschool years was not a predictor of sleep duration in kindergarten, the researchers said. The findings were scheduled for presentation Tuesday at a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in Minneapolis.
