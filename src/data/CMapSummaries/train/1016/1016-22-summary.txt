Children who regularly have trouble waking up in the morning and complain of being tired throughout the day are most likely sleep deprived and the issue may be able to be addressed in one of the following ways: - Making sure your children are getting a certain amount of physical activity each day so that he or she is actually tired enough to fall asleep at the set bed time, otherwise he or she could remain awake in bed. Children will not be able not recall the event when they wake up the next day and will usually stop having night terrors sometime during their school years and are not dangerous but they can prevent both parents and children from getting a good night's sleep. -Teeth grinding (bruxism) is something that may or may not wake children up at night and although children often outgrow the habit, it has the potential to damage your child's teeth and jaw when it is ongoing, so speaking to a dentist about realigning your child's teeth or having him or her fitted for a mouthguard to wear at night is recommended.
