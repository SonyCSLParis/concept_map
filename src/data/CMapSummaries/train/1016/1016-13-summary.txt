However, no studies to date have compared the degree and intensity of daytime behavioral problems in children with a primary behavioral sleep disorder (BSD) to those found in children with OSAS. The objectives of this pilot study were as follows: 1) to compare bedtime and sleep-associated behaviors in children with polysomnographically documented OSAS to similar behaviors in children diagnosed with a BSD (ie, limit-setting and sleep onset association disorder); 2) to compare daytime behaviors associated with sleepiness in children with OSAS to children with a BSD; and 3) to examine these sleep and daytime behaviors in children with both OSAS and a comorbid BSD. Our conceptualization of an elevated problem and intensity score on the ECBI as potentially indicative of daytime sleepiness is similar to that of other studies that have examined the complex association among daytime externalizing behavior problems, daytime sleepiness, and sleep deprivation or fragmentation in school-aged children.
