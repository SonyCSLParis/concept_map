By the time children reach preschool age, the sleep cycle is about every 90 minutes. In addition, their ability to get out of bed, separation anxiety, the need for autonomy and the development of the child's imagination can lead to sleep problems. In addition, school-aged children become more interested in TV, computers, the media and Internet as well as caffeine products - all of which can lead to difficulty falling asleep, nightmares and disruptions to their sleep.
