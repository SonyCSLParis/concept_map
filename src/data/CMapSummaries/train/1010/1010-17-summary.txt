In the past, there have been a few cases of parents who have had to pay that fine in court, so some infer from the mere existence of the fine that homeschooling is illegal. There are thousands of futoko (school refusal) kids who do not attend public schools (and many of them, no school of any sort at all), but none of their parents have been hauled off to court. -- Another successful way not to fall foul of the authorities is to convince your local public school head that you are homeschooling your kids because of your exceptional circumstances (either you are a bicultural family -- there is an educational by-law that provides exemption for such families; you are planning to send your kids overseas to foreign schools in the near future, etc) this has been often been accepted and has been sufficient for homeschooled children to remain enroled in the local public school, and eventually graduate with a local public school diploma.
