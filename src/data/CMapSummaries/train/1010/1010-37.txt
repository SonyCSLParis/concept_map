This site only provides general information about the law which is designed only to help users of the site learn more about their own legal needs. But general legal information is not the same as legal advice  true legal advice is the application of local and federal law to an individual's specific circumstances, and true legal advice can only be given by a lawyer.
This Web site is not operated by a law firm, and the content provided by this site should not be used as a substitute for legal advice from a qualified lawyer. Although we go to great lengths to make sure our information is accurate and useful, the laws vary considerably in different jurisdictions (from State to State and from County to County) and laws change frequently. As a result, you should never rely on the accuracy or applicability of the information provided by this Web site because there is no substitute for true legal advice from a lawyer. We strongly recommend you consult a lawyer to discuss the laws in your area and how they apply to your particular situation.
