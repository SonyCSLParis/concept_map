"We have a good homeschool law in California because we are one of the 12 states where we operate under the private school exemption," says Roy Hanson. Some of these facts are The California Department of Education (CDE) supports private homeschoolers without a teaching credential, A 1998 amendment to California's Education Code recognizes homeschooling parents as private school teachers, Teacher certification is no longer required for homeschooling parents in any part of the U.S., and Today, private homeschooling in California and throughout the 50 states is an established, successful educational alternative. In a statement on March 11, 2008, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell reaffirmed CDE's support: "I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that choose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not change in any way as a result of this ruling.
