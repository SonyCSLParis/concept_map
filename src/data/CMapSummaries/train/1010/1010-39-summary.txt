Our Joint Current Opinion The CA state group leaders along with national HSLDA are in agreement that nothing has changed, and it is as legal to homeschool in California today as it was before this ruling. You may have heard of the recent ruling in California by an appellate court that a homeschooling family must send their children to public school because, basically, it's not legal in CA to homeschool.
