Hosting a support meeting of this nature would be a helpful way for local Homeschool Groups to support their members' possible needs and at the same time, extend an invitation to the local community for anyone interested in homeschooling, struggling with the work issue, or just wanting more information. I do not recommend that homeschool parents take the Educators Expense deduction. I will bake cookies only if I know they will be given to someone else or taken to a party within one day of baking.
