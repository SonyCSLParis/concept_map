The table reflects a difference in opinion about what makes a good education .
For example, testing appears as both an advantage and disadvantage on the schools list. Testing is seen as a good thing by many, but can cause stress and pressure on children - as well as helping to instill a feeling of success or failure depending on the results.
Usually this is raised as a disadvantage of homeschooling , but it can in fact work wonderfully well in allowing the children to choose friends they really like. And although it is said that children get the opportunity to socialize at school, some children are still isolated, or bullied.
You can only really compare on an individual basis . What can you offer your child by homeschooling them, and what would be their opportunities at your local public school?
