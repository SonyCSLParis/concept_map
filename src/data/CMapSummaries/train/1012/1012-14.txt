HSLDA is a nonprofit national membership organization of families who homeschool their children. HSLDA is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, tax-exempt organization under the rules of the IRS.
The Federal Relations Department (formerly known as the National Center for Home Education) is a department of Home School Legal Defense Association that focuses on federal legislation, grassroots lobbying, and research.
HSLDA's mission is to protect the freedom of all homeschoolers regardless of their faith background. HSLDA officers, directors and employees are followers of Christ who seek to provide the very highest levels of service in defending homeschooling freedom and equipping homeschoolers. HSLDA membership is open to all who choose to exercise their fundamental parental right to educate their children at home.
The Home School Foundation is a related organization of HSLDA. HSF was founded by HSLDA to provide assistance to homeschooling families in need, preserve parental freedoms, promote homeschooling, and support like-minded organizations. (See HSFs home page for more information .)
HSLDA's board of directors founded PHC as a college that emphasizes the apprenticeship model of education and will positively impact our culture.
Patrick Henry College opened its doors on September 1, 2000 to prepare and develop leaders who will fight for the principles of liberty and our home school freedoms through careers of public service and cultural influence. The College's distinctives include a deliberate outreach to home schooled students; practical apprenticeship methodology; financial independence; a general education core based on the classical liberal arts; a dedication to mentoring and discipling Christian students; and a community life that promotes virtue, leadership, and strong, life-long commitments to God, family and society.
The College's board of trustees is completely separate and distinct from HSLDA's board of directors and the College operates independently of HSLDA. Michael Farris is chancellor of the College, and is General Counsel of HSLDA directing litigation and federal legislative efforts.
Although Patrick Henry College and HSLDA are separate and distinct organizations, our board's purpose for founding the College remains the same and HSLDA continues to support Patrick Henry College financially and structurally. Specifically, HSLDA donates use of facility space and a portion of revenue earned from interest income to the College. This support is based upon our belief that it is not enough to rely solely on the defense of homeschooling in the courts and in the legislatures in order to maintain our freedom to homeschool and control the upbringing of our children in the future. We must be proactive in providing virtuous leaders in government and other key spheres of influence in order to preserve our freedoms.(See also Michael Smith's Washington Times op-ed "A New Generation of Moral Leadership" )
7. What is HSLDAs relationship with local and state homeschool organizations?
While HSLDA has no official relationship with any local or state homeschool groups, we do provide groups the opportunity to offer HSLDA membership at a discount to their families. Additionally, we work closely with many groups to monitor legislation that may impact homeschooling.
8. Why does HSLDA support efforts to constitutionally define marriage as between a man and a woman?
The following answer is an excerpt from a letter written by HSLDA Chairman of the Board and General Counsel Mike Farris:
. . . We are a Christian organization (see answer to question number 4 above). This colors our way of thinking about many things. Fundamentally, it is reflected in what we believe is truth.
All truth is God's truth. Man's knowledge is limited. We think we know something only to find that future generations have found that we really didn't know what we are talking about.
The truth is that God created the family. It is God's view of the family that is reflected in our western civilization and in our law until very recently. If we tear down this God-based view of the family, then all of the God-based principles in our society are ultimately at risk.
The reason we have parental rights is because our law assumes that God gave children to parents, not the state. If we eliminate the assumption of God from our law, parental rights and human rights themselves are impossible.
I was in the Soviet Union in 1988 arguing for parental rights and religious freedom with the government of the USSR. They asked, "Where are such rights based in any international legal document?"
I answered, "If rights are based on man-made documents they are not rights, they are privileges. What man makes, man can change."
Only if rights come from God is it illegitimate for man to take another's rights.
It is impossible to say that the God of the Bible would sanction rights of homosexual marriage. Thus, there is no such right in a God-based theory of rights. Any man-made theory of rights is no theory at all. ... HSLDA is not willing to move into an era of human privileges. We believe this would jeopardize our liberty to teach our children at home and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
9. Does HSLDA seek to control the public debate of homeschool issues nationwide?
While we are actively engaged in public debate regarding homeschooling, we do not seek control of the public discussions surrounding homeschooling. Our communications goal regarding mainstream media is simply to promote, honestly and fairly, the merits of home education, for the good of homeschoolers universally. We also generally promote awareness of legal and legislative issues impacting homeschool families. In order to provide timely information to media on demand, HSLDA has employed a professional director of media relations. We view media work as integral to a serious organizational effort to inform the general public about the many positive aspects of homeschooling. In recent years, the media have shown particular interest in our studies on the effectiveness of homeschooling. The hundreds of news stories referring to these studies have been good for all homeschoolers, not just members of HSLDA.
10. Does HSLDA promote exclusively Christian homeschool support organizations?
We do not. More than 1,000 support groups participate in our group discount program . Religion is not a criterion for participation. We work in conjunction with secular and religious groups alike to promote and protect home education freedoms.
11. What is HSLDA's position on charter schools and public school independent study programs?
The mission of Home School Legal Defense Association has always been to defend the rights of families who desire to privately homeschool their children. Homeschooling through charter schools or public school independent study programs is actually a form of public education, and thus falls outside of HSLDA's mission. It is our longstanding policy not to accept as HSLDA members families whose children are enrolled in such a public school option.
Parents have the right to choose whatever form of education they wish for their children. However, we urge those considering charter schools or public school independent study programs to count the cost, making sure they are fully informed.
To date, most charter school programs and all public school independent study programs have been enacted with restrictions regarding religious education. This means that it is unethical and possibly illegal for any religious education to occur during the process of teaching any academic subject through these programs. For example, religious content in a history or English class covered by the official program would be a statutory violation. (This would not be a constitutional violation by the parentsonly the government can violate the Constitution. The Constitution has been interpreted to permit but not require states to fund religious education as a component of a broad general program. This means that whatever the state statutes say is binding. If the statutes ban religious instruction in programs funded by the government, then program participantsincluding homeschooling parentswho teach religious content are violating the law.)
Keep in mind that programs receiving government funding can be directly regulated by governmental standards. For example, teaching homosexuality as an acceptable alternate lifestyle may well soon become a universal requirement for public schoolsincluding charter schools and public school independent study programs.
We understand that the financial pressures faced by families today make publicly subsidized educational programs very attractive. But if accepting government subsidies forfeits your right to teach your children in the way you desire, that price is very high indeed.
HSLDA support tax deductions for all educational expenses, similar to deductions for charitable giving or educational tax credits. But even tax deductions would be unacceptable if the mechanisms adopted allow any governmental interference or regulation of content in homeschool programs. Both HSLDA's experience and the combined history of our nation and western civilization continually demonstrate that with government funding comes government regulation. The price is too high.
12. What is HSLDAs position on access to public school facilities and activities?
HSLDAs board of directors has remained steadfast in focusing our resources on maintaining and advancing the freedom of homeschoolers from public school oversight. Therefore, the board will not allow HSLDA to use our resources to force public school districts to allow homeschool children access. Recently, several states have enacted legislation requiring public school access for homeschoolers. HSLDA takes a neutral position when legislation of this kind is introduced, unless the legislation would impose additional regulations on all homeschool students not participating in the public schools.
13. What is HSLDAs position on homeschool students use of special education and related services benefits through the public schools?
Special education refers to instruction or assistance in traditional academic areas such as math, language arts, etc. Related services, on the other hand, are aids to a childlike speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. These services indirectly improve a childs ability to learn, but are separate from traditional academic curricula. HSLDA believes the parent whose child receives related services at the public school is still a home educator.
HSLDA may assist homeschool families seeking related services that have been denied because of homeschooling. We view this as a basic fairness issue in that homeschool students in private school states are entitled to related services according to the U.S. Department of Education, but those in homeschool states are not. HSLDA will not assist homeschool students to obtain access to special education in the public school ( see number 6, below, for the reason ).
HSLDA's mission is to protect and advance the liberty of parents to educate their children at home. Membership dues will never be used for any other purpose.
However, few of us homeschool just for the sake of homeschooling. We homeschool our children because we believe it is the best path for their own future and for the impact that they can have on our nation and the generations that follow. Yes, we want our children to have excellent skills and godly character. But skills and character are designed to equip our children to accomplish great things for God and for the good of our nation.
To help our member families equip the next generation for active, effective citizenship, HSLDA founded Generation Joshua in 2004. A division of HSLDA, Generation Joshua provides young people with education on Christian citizenship, and opportunities for young people to receive hands-on training in how our nation's political system operates. Please visit Generation Joshua's website at www.generationjoshua.org .
Generation Joshua has three main components, each designed to teach homeschooled teens important aspects of civic involvement: (1) civics education, (2) nonpartisan political activity, such as voter registration drives, and (3) active involvement in the campaigns of a few candidates prayerfully selected by HSLDA's board of directors for their character and their positions on issues of importance to our members.
All candidate campaign activity is funded by HSLDA-PAC , an affiliated federal political action committee created by HSLDA in accordance with federal law. Under federal law, HSLDA may endorse federal candidates in communications to our members and we may solicit our members for contributions to HSLDA-PAC. These PAC contributions will be used to place Generation Joshua teens on selected federal campaigns under the direction and guidance of Generation Joshua staff.
Our children will not grow into leaders just because we hope for that result. They will become leaders who do great things for our nation only if we give them vision and a hands-on opportunity to learn.
What does HSLDA's Federal Relations department (formerly National Center for Home Education) do? The Federal Relations Department supports state homeschooling leaders and HSLDA members by keeping watch and taking quick action on national homeschool issues. (See the Federal Relations home page for more information .)
We do not have an official position regarding the United Nations. However, it is accurate to say that we've become more and more concerned about the sovereignty of the United States vis-à-vis the United Nations as expressed by its policies on religious liberty, human rights, children's rights, and the family. The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is an example of the UN's view of the family. We oppose the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child because it would strip parents of much of their authority to educate, train, and nurture their children according to the dictates of their conscience.
We do not take a position on gun ownership. In 12 states, homeschoolers operate as private schools under the private school law of that state. Many states and the federal government have laws that make it illegal to have a gun within 1,000 feet of any school. After concerns expressed by member families who live within 1,000 feet of a school and own guns, we asked the United States Attorney Generals Office whether this law applied to private homeschools or not. The United States Attorney Generals Office has indicated that the law does not apply to these private homeschool situations.
In every contact with a social worker/police officer regarding allegations of abuse or neglect, HSLDA provides assistance and advice to our member families. If the investigation focuses on homeschooling, we will represent you until the matter is resolved. HSLDA membership benefits do not extend to representation should court action result on non-homeschooling matters. HSLDA has in the past, and may choose in the future, to take cases where there has been a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. We reserve the right to accept such cases at our sole discretion.
Yes. On the federal level, we oppose legislation that would reduce parental freedoms and promote legislation that would increase parental freedoms and strengthen the family. In state legislatures, we work in conjunction with the state organizations towards the same goals. In representing the best interests of our members, we build consensus with the state leadership before we attempt any legislative initiative in a state. As a result of that cooperation, we have worked together with many homeschool leaders to improve the law.
4. What is HSLDAs involvement, if any, in the international growth of home education?
HSLDA is frequently contacted by individuals or associations in foreign countries asking for help with homeschooling issues. The types of inquiries range from individuals who are being prosecuted for homeschooling to those who are seeking to change their countrys law to improve the atmosphere for homeschooling, or who are establishing their own homeschool association. We have assigned Mike Donnelly, HSLDA staff attorney, to assist, wherever possible, homeschoolers in other countries where the law is difficult or does not provide for homeschooling. HSLDA has provided information to parents in many other countries who want to set up homeschool legal defense organizations. We are currently working with homeschoolers in South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Sweden among others, to establish the freedom to homeschool in those countries. We will not establish a branch of HSLDA in a foreign country.
The giving of legal advice by an HSLDA attorney establishes an attorney-client relationship which places upon the attorney certain ethical obligations toward the client. Normally, an attorney would require payment of a retainer to establish this relationship. HSLDA establishes this relationship through membership. Providing legal advice to non-members requires a commitment on our part without a return commitment on the part of the client.
7. Why doesn't HSLDA represent the parent seeking to homeschool in divorce cases?
HSLDA's primary mission is to protect the legal right of parents to homeschool from agents of the state. In truancy and educational neglect cases it is the state versus the parents. In divorce cases, however, it is father versus mother. As a general rule, homeschooling only becomes an issue in a divorce case when the parents cannot agree with each other about the children's education. Because they cannot agree, the judge must decide what's best for the children based on the evidence before him.
Also, divorce cases involve many issues besides education and are often protracted and bitter. And they are very costly. After careful consideration, we long ago determined that we simply do not have the resources to represent parents in divorce cases. Additionally, on many occasions, the breakup of the marriage comes after the parents joined HSLDA as husband and wife. Because both parents either are or have been HSLDA members we cannot represent an interest contrary to either spouse, even though one may be trying to keep the other from homeschooling.
We do provide a free information packet containing briefs and expert witness referrals and we will consult with the member's attorney where there is no conflict of interest. One exception to our basic rule is if a judge rules that homeschooling is illegal, which would have consequences statewide and not just for the parties to the divorce case. In those cases we will defend the legality of home education in that state.
No. All information is kept confidential, including address or personal information. You may periodically receive mailings from the Home School Foundation , which is a nonprofit organization directly related to HSLDA.
9. If I stop homeschooling, will HSLDA help me persuade public school officials to accept my child's homeschool credits?
It is common for public school districts to disqualify credits of homeschoolers transferring into public high school.
Consistent with our mission to conserve our resources for helping parents who continue to homeschool, we are not able to extend our advocacy to situations where parents are enrolling their students in public school. Please be aware that this limitation extends to public charter school programs.
HSLDA's mission is to advance the cause of homeschooling. To this end, we advocate for homeschoolers when the legitimacy of their diploma is questioned, for instance, by colleges, employers or military recruiters.

We also run special promotions at various times.
Despite societys doubt and skepticism, homeschoolers have become a significant demographic in America with impressive, consistent academic achievement and post-graduate success. HSLDA has initiated research and compiled statistical evidence of homeschool achievement in conjunction with the National Home Education Research Institute. You can access the results of these studies at http://www.hslda.org/research/default.asp .
No, HSLDA's payment plan can only be used with a Visa or MasterCard credit/debit card or with a checking account bank name/routing number/account number. This is because we automatically debit the account information for you each month.
2. Does HSLDA send out monthly bills or reminders for the payment plan?
No, HSLDA does not send out reminders or bills. The payments are directly debited from your account on the date designated on HSLDA's membership application. If you choose to make payments from your checking account, we suggest you make a note to record the debits in your check register.
Membership is for a minimum term of one year. You may cancel the automatic charges at any time by paying the balance due for the remainder of the current membership year. Please note that we are unable to refund your setup service fee. For example: If you are paying $10/month (which works out to $120/year), and you have made two payments totaling $20.00, your remaining balance will be $100.00.

If you are submitting your application on-line, please call our office at (540) 338-5600 and speak with one of our membership coordinators. Please do not leave a message . If you are mailing your application, you must use overnight mail to ensure expedition.
We offer a discount to families who are members of a participating discount group, a full-time pastor, full-time missionary, or active/retired/disabled military. (See Group Discounts for a discount group that will work for you. If you are the leader of a group and want to participate, please call or email HSLDA.) We also run special promotions at various times.
No. Once you are a lifetime member, you will always be a lifetime member as long as HSLDA continues to offer services and you desire to receive them. You can always contact us to tailor your account so that you are receiving only those communications which you desire.
It depends on the homeschool law for your state. Please read it carefully to determine what is written in the law. Click on this link to find the law for your state However, though it may be legal in your state, HSLDA will not defend your right to teach a child other than your own.
You will want to contact your local Red Cross to find out about training and if there are any age stipulations for your area. Generally for membership, we require children under 14 years of age to be supervised.
8. Can I join if I already have legal problems concerning my homeschooling?
Yes, you are welcome to apply. However, if you are in legal trouble, we may not be able to accept your application. Your application will need to be reviewed by the legal department. HSLDA reserves the right not to approve any membership application. We also reserve the right to revoke membership if any information has been misrepresented. If your application cannot be approved, we will return your payment and send a letter of explanation.
Many countries other than the United States have specific laws allowing homeschooling, or have very loose compulsory attendance laws that are satisfied by a homeschool program. HSLDA is working hard to change the laws in the few countries that currently do not allow homeschooling.
We assist our members when their right to homeschool is challenged, whether they reside in other countries as private American citizens, active-duty US military, or as national citizens. Please review HSLDA's International Services for further details or visit our International page for further information.
10. Can I become a member of HSLDA if I don't use a standard curriculum or consider myself an "unschooler?"
HSLDA accepts as members families who use a wide variety of homeschooling strategies. All we ask is that you keep a record of what your child learns so we can defend you should your homeschooling methods come under scrutiny.
