When one of these things happens, I will tell her it's time for a time-out, and escort her to either a corner in the room, or to a chair (we don't have a specific time-out place). Or sometimes because I need to stop the bad behavior but don't want my son to see me either laughing at what he's done or counting to ten so I don't go Homer on him . We have tried "time-outs" in a designated chair, but she is, as you say, wise to this sort of stuff, and she has started to go there on her own.
