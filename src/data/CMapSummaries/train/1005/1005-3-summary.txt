Discipline can be loving, kind and firm, keeping intact the dignity and respect of both parent and child, and should not be confused with hurt or punishment. A parent who picks up a crying baby is teaching the baby that its distress matters to the parent, and that the baby can trust that the caring parent will be there to comfort it and make the world right. But my son's reaction did remind me that it must be really disheartening for kids to hear the constant barrage of no's and directives from parents-don't touch that; sit down; drink your milk; do up your coat; use your manners; no...you can't do that; ask for help; no...not right now.
