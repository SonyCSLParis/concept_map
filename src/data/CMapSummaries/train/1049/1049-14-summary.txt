Christopherus is firmly rooted in  the work of Rudolf Steiner , his ideas on the development of the whole human being - and thus we work with the Waldorf curriculum and pedagogy. We feel passionately that homeschooling is the best option for many children - that Waldorf education is wonderful but that not all Waldorf schools work for all children. Something to think about when deciding whether to take a pause year or repeat a grade is this: will your child be better off going to college or into the workforce at just over 17 or closer to 19?
