Their parents choose to opt for homeschooling for a number of reasons - it could be that they're not happy with the schools in their area, that their children wasn't happy at school, that their child has a disability or learning problem that they feel they could handle better if educated at home, or that they simply feel their child would benefit from a more individual form of education. The Pros Of Homeschooling There are a variety of benefits with the homeschooling approach: Children can benefit from getting more attention to their own learning when they're taught alone, or in small groups (some homeschooling families join together for learning).

About Montessori Early in the twentieth century, Maria Montessori developed educational materials and methods based on years of her research, which showed that children learn best by doing, not by passively accepting other people's ideas and pre-existing knowledge. The Montessori Method is dynamic in that observation and the meeting of needs is continual and specific for each child. The power of the Montessori teaching approach has been proven by modern research to enhance performance, interest, persistence, memory, and creativity in learning.
The basis of her method is that the pace of student learning is as variable as the student. Age Groupings In Montessori schools and classrooms students are grouped according to age. This method allows the student to have a greater understanding of the topic.
