That is it! And a school must take the stance with children that 'we are here to serve', we are here to make sure your day is a safe one and a good one. On the contrary, you would actup in class or with other students if all you heard nonstop was do not bully!!
General Statement of Policy No employee or agent of the school district shall cause corporal punishment to be inflicted upon a student to reform unacceptable conduct or as a penalty for unacceptable conduct. As used in this policy, the term "corporal punishment" means conduct involving hitting or spanking a person with or without an object, or unreasonable physical force that causes bodily harm or substantial emotional harm. Employees who violate the provisions of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action as appropriate.
Corporal punishment, as defined by paddling, slapping or otherwise physically striking a student, is not condoned or supported by the Northeastern School District . However, the use of reasonable physical force may be used by staff members against students only in the following circumstances:
Congressional Action on Corporal Punishment in Schools Editor's note: Links are free and current at time of posting, but may require registration or expire over time. Congressman Phil Hare of Illinois is also a co-sponsor of this legislation. The bill includes a number of important protections for students, including, but not limited to: Banning corporal punishment in public schools and private schools that serve students receiving federal services; Requiring states to submit plans to the Secretary of Education describing their policies eliminating corporal punishment and making school personnel and parents aware of the ban; Allowing for the withholding of federal funds for failure to comply with the Act; Creating a grant program, in which the Secretary may award grants to state educational agencies to improve school climate and implement school wide positive behavior support approaches (PBS); and, Instituting a National Assessment to be carried out by the Secretary to determine compliance with the Act and to identify best practices, including training models that emphasize positive behavior supports.
Corporal Punishment in Schools The American Academy of Family Physicians is opposed to corporal punishment in schools. The AAFP defines corporal punishment in schools as the purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for disapproved behavior. Positive reinforcement has been shown to be more effective and long-lived than aversive reinforcement.
My intended point amidst this discussion of contrasting legal systems is that even though the Mexican legal system differs in a FUNDAMENTAL way from that of the United States on the basis of an assumption of innocence or guilt, as a theoretical system it is SUPERIOR to that found in many if not most of our U.S. schools when it comes to situations like student fighting. I think one of the common refrains we hear from defendants of the "status quo" of school discipline systems would be, "These are policies for school, not for the real world outside of schools. The other issue which this situation points to is whether or not public school attendance should be mandatory in the United States in the twenty-first century.
The term does not include: physical pain caused by reasonable physical activities associated with athletic training, competition, or physical education; or the use of restraint as authorized under Section 37.0021.# Section 37.0011 goes on to state that a school district is permitted to use corporal punishment (provided that the district has adopted a policy permitting the use) unless a student's parent or guardian  has previously provided a written, signed statement prohibiting the use of corporal punishment as a method of student discipline  # While this language provides parents a method of "opting out" of the use of corporal punishment, it also places the responsibility of preventing the use of corporal punishment on the parents. Such written and signed statement must be provided to the District each year in order to continue the prohibition of such punishment.# A parent's prohibition of corporal punishment may be revoked at any time by submitting a separate signed, written statement.# Questions have arisen about this topic, however, based on the TASB Policy Service recommended FO (LOCAL) policy issued with the recent Update 91. Historically, school districts have had the right to  inflict moderate corporal punishment for the purpose of restraining or correcting the refractory student,  as long as that punishment is reasonable.# When the right to use corporal punishment was challenged as  cruel and unusual punishment,  the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal law's prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishment" under the 8th Amendment was "inapplicable" to corporal punishment in public schools.# Furthermore, Section 22.0512(c) of the Education Code recognizes a district's right to use corporal punishment, and specifically states that nothing in this section of the Education Code prohibits a school district from  enforcing a policy relating to corporal punishment  # But before you go swinging into action, remember that corporal punishment must be reasonable and must not be excessive.
Tardiness Policy (8053) The following policy on tardiness was adopted by the Board of Education and may be found in the Policy Manual: Training for punctuality is a joint function of the home and the school in preparation for later life in the industrial, business, or professional world. Any pupil who is tardy will be required to present a note or tardiness form as required by the school, signed by the parent and stating the date and reason for the tardiness. This tardiness is to be noted in the school register and on his record card except in cases of approved tardiness for religious obligations, in which cases the school must be notified in writing the day before the tardiness occurs.
In 1974 the Australian Psychological Society, Queensland Branch, stated that it was opposed to violence and, since corporal punishment was institutionalised violence, it should be abolished 79 . Another parent complained in 1977 that there was no right of appeal against corporal punishment, which was a form of violence no longer used in prisons. The Committee requested the State Ministers for Education, Parent organisations and teacher training institutions to support this policy.
Learn how to create a tardy policy for secondary school students so that you can have an effective way of disciplining lateness. It's important to set a policy from the start and maintain your authority and keep to that policy throughout the semester and school year. Students that are tardy will get a zero on that quiz.
In B.C. A B.C. A review of the research.
Students at the school are spanked only by Dixson or the assistant principal, and there is always a witness. Students at the school are spanked only by Dixson or the assistant principal, and there is always a witness. "If I would have hit my son how she hit him, I would have been in jail, I would have been on the news, I would have been messed up trying to get my children back," Jones says.
Based upon the extant literature, this study will test the following four primary hypotheses: • Because there are few requirements guiding the creation of school substance use and gambling policies, the content and clarity of these policies will be heterogeneous across schools and modes of policy distribution (e.g., handbooks vs. school Web sites); • College alcohol policies currently devote relatively little attention to student recovery; • Due to differences in enforcement, awareness of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, educational programs and types of students, schools with either no or only restrictive alcohol use policies will experience higher levels of binge drinking among students than schools with prohibitive and recovery-oriented alcohol policies; • Absent a federal mandate that requires gambling-related regulations or education on college campuses, gambling policies will be less prevalent than alcohol use policies. "Low Agreement" Policy Variables, Mentioned Inconsistently in School Handbooks and Web Materials (N = 28) Identifying the Underlying Dimensions of College Policy As noted earlier, the coding process revealed that all 117 colleges (i.e., 100% of the schools for which information was available) in this sample had a written policy on student alcohol consumption, but only 26 (22%) had a published policy that addressed gambling. Policy, Binge Drinking and Gambling The analysis of policy variables and binge drinking rates revealed a variety of relationships among policy variables and student drinking behaviors.
School Punishment Schools generally employ a hierarchy of punishments for infractions of rules. While there are variations between types of school, boarding and day schools, with not all being applied in all cases, the hierarchy is generally reasonably consistent.
The Board's current policy on corporal punishment as set forth in Section 4 of the Code of Student Conduct fails to comply with either North Carolina law or the due process requirements of the United States Constitution. It should also be noted that nowhere in the Code of Student Conduct, including both the Elementary School Code and the Upper School Code, is there a statement to the effect that  each "prohibited behavior" may be punished by corporal punishment   Thus, although the Board's corporal punishment policy has resulted in the administration of corporal punishment in the Union County school system, the Board's policy fails to comply with the statutory requirements set forth in Section 115C-391 (a). According to data obtained from the Union County Public Schools and published by The Enquirer-Journal , students were punished 20 times for being tardy; yet, "being tardy" is not listed by either the Elementary School Code or the Upper School Code as a "prohibited behavior" or as an action that might result in corporal punishment.
Corporal Punishment in Schools The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that corporal punishment in schools be abolished in all states by law and that alternative forms of student behavior management be used. Washington, DC: Office of Civil Rights, US Department of Education; 1987 The National Center for the Study of Corporal Punishment and Alternatives. States Which Have Abolished Corporal Punishment as a Means of Discipline in the Schools .
They believe that it is not optional and is "the only biblically approved way to discipline children" (Robinson par. The new policies, as stated by the General Assembly of North Carolina, include that corporal punishment will only consist of "...a hand spanking on the buttocks through the student's customary mode of dress" and "Only by a teacher, principal, or assistant principal of the same gender of the student and who has been trained in the administration of corporal punishment..." They are not allowed to do this in front of other students. Pediatrics 106 (2000): 343 "Corporal Punishment (for Children)."
Given the international legal prohibition on corporal punishment, and the accelerating rate of bans on the practice in public schools in the US and abroad, corporal punishment should be abolished immediately in the US. Until a full ban is adopted, provide parents with the right to seek redress against school districts and educators who use corporal punishment in violation of their preferences. Until such a ban is enacted, establish adequate complaint and redress procedures (accessible to parents and children) for children who are beaten severely or inappropriately (including consideration of their age or special education status), or who are beaten in violation of expressed parental preferences.
A Policy for Corporal Punishment in Schools Corporal punishment may only be given to students who have signed "Parental Consent to Administer Corporal Punishment" form on file in the principal's office. Swats will be given and witnessed by certified personnel in a school office, room, or other place out of the presence of other students. No more than 3 swats will be given in a school day.
Judges have made rules about physical punishment of children by their parents where punishment has been so severe that it amounted to criminal assault. What you are punished with Where you are hit . Even if the punishment is with your parents' consent , the baby-sitter and your parents could be held responsible for any harm you suffer.
If the punishment inflicted is later found to have been excessive - not reasonably believed at the time to be necessary for the child's discipline or training - the school authorities inflicting it may be held liable in damages to the child and, if malice is shown, they may be subject to criminal penalties. We conclude that the Due Process Clause does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in the public schools, as that practice is authorized and limited by the common law. The majority purports to follow the settled principle that what process is due depends on "'the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [the protected] interest... and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards'"; it recognizes, as did Goss, the risk of error in the school disciplinary process and concedes that "the child has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment...," but it somehow concludes that this risk is adequately reduced by a damages remedy that never has been recognized by a Florida court, that leaves unprotected the innocent student punished by mistake, and that allows the State to punish first and hear the student's version of events later.
Opponents of corporal punishment, including LWVO, have urged lawmakers for several years to ban corporal punishment in Ohio's schools. HB 26, which bans corporal punishment in all Ohio public and nonpublic schools. The State Board of Education has developed a number of resources, guidelines, and tools on its website for school districts to use to ensure safe and supportive learning environments, without using corporal punishment.
Shockingly, in twenty states, corporal punishment is still a legal and accepted form of discipline by teachers and school administrators. But are the problems in Memphis so much worse than in New York or Washington, D.C (both places where corporal punishment is illegal) that they have to resort to physical violence?

Policy 4302 From Board Policies SCHOOL PLAN FOR MANAGEMENT OF STUDENT BEHAVIOR Policy Code: 4302 Each school must have a plan for managing student behavior that incorporates effective strategies consistent with the purposes and principles established in policy 4300 , Student Behavior Policies. No school plan for managing student behavior may authorize the use of corporal punishment. Principals shall report on at least an annual basis to the superintendent and the board on the effectiveness of the plan in minimizing classroom disruptions, referrals to the principal's office and the use of out-of-school suspension.
But in the state's public schools, there's no ban on hitting, because North Carolina is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment to be used in schools. "I really think it's probably a form of discipline that has aged out," said Nolte. But on the other side, it seems that there are only a few school administrators who will make a defense for it, and even then it's half-hearted and with some pretty strong caveats.
This follow-up report, a shocking investigation chronicling the abusive use of seclusion and restraint on school children and the lack of state and federal regulation, is updated with progress made in 2009. 1/26/2010 - On January 26, 2010 US Department of Education issued a letter from Arne Duncan on restraint and seclusion. DRC hopes that by continuing to draw attention to the use of corporal punishment in Arkansas, Arkansas will enact legislation banning corporal punishment in all schools.
Positive Behaviour Policy Positive Behaviour is the system and ethos in a school which aims to cultivate in our children an acceptance of responsibility for their own decisions and behaviour and also to accept the consequences for their actions. Teachers will use only those punishments or sanctions which are appropriate to the individual child's needs and circumstances. The respect in which the school is held by parents and the wider community.
The immediate aims of such punishment are usually to halt the offense, prevent its recurrence and set an example for others. In corporal punishment, the adult usually hits various parts of the child's body with a hand, or with canes, paddles, yardsticks, belts, or other objects expected to cause pain and fear. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment and supports legislation outlawing its use.
That means that the only punishment that I will have available to me as a school will be the loss of student Internet privileges. I think that students might need to be guided in this because most of the blogs they would naturally be drawn to might not meet any of the criteria for a really good blog. M: And if you don't, will your comment and/or post be deleted?
Section 160.261, RSMo , requires the local board of education to establish rules for student conduct and that school district teachers, administrators and staff hold every student accountable for any disorderly conduct in school. A suspension for a period of not less than one year, or expulsion, for a student who is determined to have brought a weapon to school in violation of district policy and whether a superintendent, or in a district with no high school, the principal may modify such suspension on a case-by-case basis. If the suspension is in excess of ten days or an expulsion, state statute requires that the school must provide the student with appropriate due process.
There are many alternatives to corporal punishment, and it is through practice that they will be developed by learners, educators and parents. Respect for all Children and their teachers have the right to have difficulties in behaviour in educational situations addressed without prejudice All persons involved in difficulties in behaviour have a right to have their views and feelings taken into account at all times Policy and practice should actively promote mutual respect for schools, parents, teachers and children 3. Also in the UK, the "Improving Behaviour in Schools" website ( www.dcfs.gov.uk/ibis/index.cfm ) contains the government's official policies on promoting positive classroom behaviour in schools, as well as documents, leaflets, checklists and contacts on many aspects of pupil behaviour and bullying, including case studies of schools that are tackling behaviour problems.
From Alamance-Burlington School Board Policies Believing that other forms of discipline are more appropriate with children of all ages, the Alamance-Burlington Board of Education prohibits the use of corporal punishment. For the protection of persons or property. Use of reasonable force consistent with Section B of this policy is not considered corporal punishment.
According to the Annual Report on School Safety published by the U.S. Department of Education, 94 percent of schools have zero-tolerance policies for firearms, 91 percent have similar policies for other weapons, 88 percent have zero tolerance policies for drugs 87 percent for alcohol, and 79 percent have zero tolerance policies for violence and tobacco. The Court ruled that there was no due process violation, that the student failed to establish such violations, and that there was no school district discrimination in its staffing practices. It may be concluded that zero tolerance policies should address the most severe offenses, that is, behavior that should result in automatic suspension or expulsion.
It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that corporal punishment should be legally prohibited in all states and that alternative forms of student behavior management e utilized in the school setting. Historically corporal punishment has been used to discipline school students although physical punishment is currently prohibited in public schools in 29 states, including many school districts in many major American cities (Gershoff, 2008; National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools [NCACPS], 2008; United State Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2009).The American Academy of Pediatrics (2006), the National Parent Teacher Association (2010), the National Association of School Psychologists (2006), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2007) are among groups that have taken a position recommending the abolishment of corporal punishment. Corporal punishment adversely affects students' self-image and school achievement, can contribute to disruptive behaviors, can result in physical harm, inhibits the development of appropriate social skills, and also promotes the message that violence is an acceptable mode of behavior in our schools (National Association of School Psychologists [NASP], 2006).
It is lawful in Australia to use corporal punishment to discipline children as long as the punishment is "reasonable" in the circumstances. There is no legislation concerning corporal punishment by parents in Victoria, however, there is a common law defence for parental use of corporal punishment. Section 257 of the code states that: it is lawful for a parent or a person in the place of a parent.... to use, by way of correction, toward a child or pupil under his care, such force as is reasonable under the circumstances.

A school can make reasonable rules for the good order of the school and the discipline of students. Good discipline in a school is required to ensure that schools are able to provide quality education for all students and to guarantee the care and safety of the school community. But if you are out of class for a longer period, for example for more than one school period, you should be supervised and given school work to do.
Corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 22 states, according to court papers filed on behalf of the charter school, the School of Excellence in Education. You probably should have filed your complain in state court where your case wouldn't turn on the question of whether it was a violation of federal rights (which in fact, it was). LAST THOUGHT: the school had no more legal power to hold her down and beat her when she expressed desire to vacate the premises than it would have had to visit her home or grab her on the street and beat her.
In a handful of districts, like the one here in Everman, there have been recent moves to reinstate it, some successful, more not. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed around the country, including as recently as August in a case involving a student and a baseball coach in Cameron County, Okla., but thus far, courts have tended to side with school districts in cases where a corporal punishment policy is on the books, said Nadine Block, the director of the Center for Effective Discipline, a group opposed to the practice. He got permission to reinstate it in the middle school, too, and began with the 2005-6 school year, during which 150 of the school's 685 students were paddled.
The public by a 2-1 margin approves of spanking children in principle, and half of parents say they sometimes do it to their own kids, an ABCNEWS poll found. Indeed, even among adults who spank their own child, 67 percent say grade-school teachers should not be permitted to spank children at school. Generally, the guidelines include some or all of the following: No spanking of students in front of other students, as it was done in the past The number of swats a student should receive should be specified The person administering the punishment must be either a school administrator or someone substituting for the school administrator There must be a witness present to make sure that the procedure follows the policy's guidelines Corporal punishment must be a last resort after other non-corporal punishments have been attempted The person administering the punishment is not the person who the student directly got into trouble with, to assure that there are no emotions involved in the administration of the spanking The person administering the punishment should take into account the student's sex, size, and their general physical condition Some policies specify the instrument that is to be used in the spanking, while others say an appropriate instrument must be used Most policies specify that the punishment must be applied to a fleshy part of the body, such as the buttocks Some policies allow parents the opportunity to opt out of corporal punishment of their child by signing a form at the beginning of the school year Parents are made aware of the school's policy on discipline Even with all the policies in place, Salter said school officials try to avoid corporal punishment.
A school discipline policy can help prevent and control student behavior problems by coordinating the school's disciplinary procedures and by informing students what types of behavior are expected of them and what types are forbidden. Ben Brodinsky, for example, states these functions as follows (1980): --Informing the reader of the school board's discipline philosophy --Placing responsibility for policy enforcement --Specifying offenses and fixing their seriousness STUDENT DISCIPLINE POLICY IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS.
In all 50 states, it is illegal to hit a prisoner or an animal. More statistics, along with suggestions for what you can do to take action against corporal punishment can be found on their websites.

The Center for Effective Discipline has completed a survey of corporal punishment policies of Catholic dioceses in the continental U.S. and Hawaii . These 42 diocesan schools offices verified that corporal punishment is not being used or is specifically banned in those diocesan schools. From the US Conference of Catholic Bishops: "The Catholic Church teaches that violence against another person in any form fails to treat that person as someone worthy of love.
Things like having mandatory minimum sentencing laws, or having three strikes and you're out, or the idea of aggressively policing minor offenses -- these are things that were happening as a result of the war on drugs and we were implementing these processes in schools. Freeman: Back in the day when I was in school, [things like talking back to a teacher] weren't appropriate for the schoool environment, but they resulted in a trip to principal's office, or a call home. They had an exorbitant number of out of school suspensions.
Latest Developments In the United States 2009 has not been a stellar year for those who want to see corporal punishment banned in our schools. Report on Physical Punishment in the United States is a peer-reviewed research report on the effects of corporal punishment in our schools. But the reality is that child abuse is a felony in most of the United States.
While local school districts have long since been required to keep records on their use of corporal punishment, recent legislative changes now require school districts to submit those data to the Department of Public Instruction for release in an annual consolidated report to the General Assembly. During the 2010-2011 school year, American Indian students, who account for less than two percent of the student population statewide, received more than one-third of all corporal punishment in North Carolina public schools. "If there is any good news it is that corporal punishment is being used less and less in our public schools," said Vitaglione.
"If I would have hit my son how she hit him, I would have been in jail, I would have been on the news, I would have been messed up trying to get my children back," Jones said. But supporters of school corporal punishment argue that paddling keeps kids in school, because the alternative for students with bad behavior would be suspension. And when others do it, he says he can't watch.
We teach our children that violence is wrong, yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems. Another example is a Joint Statement on Physical Punishment of Children and Youth, developed by a national coalition of organizations in Canada, facilitated by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. There are numerous alternatives to corporal punishment that have proven to be effective.
