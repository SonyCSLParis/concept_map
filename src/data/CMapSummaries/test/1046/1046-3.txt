Getting Involved
Parent Advisory Council / Friends of Rideau Park
Parents are involved in the school in various ways. Helping in the classroom, accompanying field trips, and helping out with clubs and special lunches are just a few of the ways parental contributions are welcomed at Rideau Park.
There are two organizations that are parent led.; PAC, the Parent Advisory Council, which meets with the Principal monthly and provides ideas and opinions about what is needed to help the school function most effectively from a parent's perspective and Friends of Rideau Park, which is a registered society. Friends does fundraising and provides "extras" for Rideau Park School such as funding gymnastics field trips, treats for school occasions like St. Nikolaus Day, technology, and special requests from teachers.

School Council
Parents as Partners
The Rideau Park School Council is one of the many ways that you can have a voice in your school. Our purpose is to promote communication and to provide input into the decision making process at the school. We strive to keep you informed on recent developments in our school community and at Edmonton Public Schools.
The school council has a visible presence through social functions. We are involved in such events as Read-In Week, Special Lunch Days, Owl News, and coordinating special events. We seek your involvement and participation to keep the council proactive. Get to know your council members. Come and meet with us on the second Tuesday of the month or drop your suggestions/concerns in our mail box in the school office.
Volunteers Welcome!
Rideau Park School supports and encourages all parent/guardians, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, grandfathers, and members of our community to become involved in the education of our children.
Please consider this very worthwhile and rewarding experience.
