Establishing a positive and communicative relationship between parents, teachers and students is a critical part of helping achieve excellence in education. As a parent, you are the "main teacher" and positive influence for your child in education and in life. Using our common faith and shared beliefs, our Catholic schools support the educational and life journeys of children. We look forward to working closely with parents as students develop and grow in our care.
We recognize that parents want to know how they can help children do better in school. One of the best ways is to become involved.
What are some of the ways you can become involved?
Communications  - Maintaining open and ongoing communications with your child's school. Reading notes, newsletters, school journals and checking out our Board's web site are great ways to keep informed of what is going on at the school and how your child is doing.
Parent Teacher Interviews  - Attending conferences with your child's teacher. This is a formal opportunity to have an undivided, one-on-one discussion with your child's teacher. These interviews give parents a good sense of their child's progress and what they can do to help.
Learning at Home  - Assisting children with homework and/or course selections are excellent ways for you to help monitor their progress and understand what they are doing at school. Take a look at our Homework and Learning at Home links for some good tips.
Participating in School Events  - Attending school events such as plays, assemblies, barbecues, etc., are great ways to informally meet teachers, school staff, other children and parents. This also shows children that you are interested in their school experience.
Volunteering  - Our schools are always looking for parent volunteers.  There is a wide range of volunteer opportunities to help you become engaged with your child's education. We encourage you to take a look at the Parent Volunteers link to get more information.
Important note: anyone interested in volunteering at one of our schools must submit an original or certified copy of a Criminal Backround Check form, including Vulnerable Sector Screening . This process must be completed at your own expense. I ndividuals will not be allowed to volunteer without this information first being received by the principal of your child's school. For information on our Criminal Background Check policy statement and procedural document , refer to the links provided.
What are some of the strategies that you can use to ensure your child's success in school?

If your child is experiencing difficulty, be sure to ask his or her teacher for help
Make sure to notify the school if your child is going to be absent or late
You can support teachers in their efforts by encouraging strong study habits, reading for pleasure and exhibiting positive behaviour
We have developed procedures to ensure that every student enjoys a safe, productive and positive school experience - we look to parents to help us ensure these rules and guidelines are understood and respected by children and families
You can read with your child regularly and provide a variety of reading materials in your home
It is also helpful to ask your child each day about school, learning and homework - keep the lines of communication open between you and your child
Limiting the amount of time spent watching television or playing video games in favour of family trips to museums, libraries and cultural events will go a long way in helping to improve learning success
Become involved in school events or become a parent volunteer
Provide and update the school with current information such as telephone number(s), address, immunization records and previous school reports
It is also very important to provide the school with any information you think might affect your child's ability to learn or behave
