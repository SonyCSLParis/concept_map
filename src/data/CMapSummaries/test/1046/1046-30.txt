Getting involved at your child's school
Becoming a parent governor
One way to get involved at your child's school is to become a parent governor. Contact the clerk to the governing body at your child's school to find out when there will be a vacancy. You can read more about the nomination process and how to search for vacancies:
You should also let your headteacher know of your interest - there may be other types of vacancy on the governing body.
Help and support for new governors
Most schools provide an induction programme for new governors. The Children's Services Authority (CSA) also offers induction training. Details of training and support can be obtained from the link governor at the school or from Governor Services.

Parent teacher associations
Most schools have a parent teacher association (PTA) with parent representation for different classes. Ask your child's teacher or the school office if you want to find out more about how this works.
PTAs give parents and teachers a chance to discuss issues and improve their understanding of each other's roles and points of view.
Are there other ways I can get involved in my child's school?
Your child's teacher or headteacher will be happy to discuss ways you can help out at school. Schools are generally keen to take up offers of help - for example, helping with trips, art work, hearing children read and helping with special projects where you have particular expertise.
There are other informal ways you can get involved, such as with fundraising events and celebrations.
Parent Governor Representatives
Parent Governor Representatives (PGRs) represent the views of all parents. They are parent governors who have been elected to sit on Local Authority scrutiny committees dealing with education.
They provide a non-political voice for all parents in their area in local decision making. You can contact them about general education issues.
