What is the SAC Committee? The School Advisory Council (SAC) is a team of people representing various segments of the community-parents, teachers, students, administrators, support staff, business/ industry people and other interested community members.

The purpose of the School Improvement Plan is to increase student performance.  The SAC committee assists the school principal with budget and recommendation on how school monies are spent or allocated.

SAC also gives the opportunity for parents to actively participate in setting goals and making plans to achieve those academic goals.
SAC allows for parents to identify issues that need to be addressed concerning the school climate.
What is the purpose of volunteering? Whether you are a student seeking community service opportunities, a parent or grandparent seeking to become more involved in the education of your children or grandchildren, a retired or senior citizen seeking an outlet for your talents, experiences, and skills, or a corporation wishing to give your employees greater opportunity to be involved in their community the Volunteer Services program has the answer to your needs.
What do SBBC Volunteers do? As a volunteer, you can choose what you do.  You can read with children, go on field trips, talk about careers, assist with band or sports activities, tell children about famous artists, strengthen math skills or help in other ways that your school needs.  You make the choice!
Volunteering for the greater good. Volunteer for the school - not your child!  While we know you want to be close to your child at school, the idea of volunteering is to provide services to the school as a whole.
Why should I? Getting involved in the school pays off for you, your child and every student at the school. By volunteering to help, your service makes a difference.  The more parents - and community members - volunteer their time to help the school, the greater the impact. Classroom teachers can add learning activities, the school can offer more programs, and students can get extra help because of active school volunteers.
What is the process for becoming a volunteer? The first step to becoming a volunteer is to fill out a volunteer application.  The form is online and you will need your driver's license, passport or state ID. After you finish your volunteer application, it will be reviewed.  In one week, you can contact the school to learn about volunteer opportunities and training. &gt;&gt; Learn more about becoming a Volunteer.
Why should I become a mentor? At a time when school districts are faced with mounting costs and funding shortfalls it is important that the needs of the students are not shortchanged. Individuals, businesses and organizations often look for ways to support schools that are immediate and measurable.  Investing in the future of our youth by becoming a mentor to students who need the guidance of caring adults is a wonderful way to get involved.
Youth who are paired with mentors have the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skill including, goal setting; effective problem solving; practical living skills; respect for others; communication and leadership skills and an appreciation for gender, age and cultural diversity.
What do SBBC Mentors do? There are a variety of mentoring options available. Mentors are asked to make a commitment to meet with mentees for one hour a week throughout the school year. For busy executives whose schedules may prevent this level of commitment, we encourage the identification of a co-mentor who can arrange to fill in if the primary mentor is unavailable. While one-on-one mentoring is the most effective model, some schools provide the option of creating a group mentoring program where one or several individuals arrange to meet with a group of students regularly to talk about topics of interest. &gt;&gt; Learn more about becoming a Mentor .
School Advisory Forum (SAF) The School Advisory Forum (SAF) is open to all members of the school and community. The Forum has one member to report to the School Advisory Council, which then sends a representative to the district SAC. The district SAC acts as advisors, mentors, and advocates to both the district and to each school advisory council. At a School Advisory Forum all present will:
Plan, develop, and implement parent/community programs and training activities.
Address parent/community concerns; work with administration to solve problems and initiate desired changes.
Identify and coordinates the use of community resources to improve student achievement and school effectiveness.
Participate in increasing/sustaining high levels of community support for the school.
Assist SAC in identifying the educational needs and priorities of the school.

Jointly works with School Board Members, Superintendent, and local Government officials.
Facilities, Safety, Legislative, ESE, ESOL, Boundaries, Curriculum, Dress code, and Transportation are all issues addressed by SAF.
What can be accomplished if I participate in SAF? Over the years, it has been parents, teachers, community members, etc. who have made positive changes in schools.  These changes can be at the school level, district level, state level and within the community or city.  From the school level, parents like you made the following changes:
Instead of having social security number to identify children, the schools now use a new randomly generated number to prevent identify theft and other privacy issues.
Defibrillators are now at every high school. A defibrillator is a machine used to shock the victim's heart and restore the heart's normal rythmic patterns. When a defibrillator is used, it in effect kicks the heart into action again, causing it to resume sending blood throughout the body. This was needed specifically due to incidents during athletic activities.
It is now mandated that recess must not be used as punishment and all elementary students are entitled to 15 minutes of recess.
Currently, SAF was brought the idea to make lunch account information available online.
