Get Involved!
At Brighter Choice Charter School for Girls, we encourage family members and community members to get involved in our school. We have an "Open Door" policy that allows parents to come into school and participate in or observe class at any time. Family members may also want to join students as their classes participate in special activities or assist with classroom learning. You should contact your child's teacher or our parent coordinator for specific times that you would be able to help out with these types of activities. You can also volunteer to be a "Room Parent" and support your child's teacher and class.
Parents and community members are also encouraged to join in the successes of Brighter Choice Charter School for Girls. We hold events both during school hours and on nights and weekends. Some events are held on campus, such as our "Meet Your Daughter Night" and Family Night events. All family members and community members are encouraged to join us at these events and support our school.
Below is a list of ways that you can get involved in Brighter Choice Charter School for Girls. For more information, please call your child's teacher or the parent coordinator.
