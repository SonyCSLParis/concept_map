High School Parents Can Still Be Involved!
Shauna Boyce , Principal of Memorial Composite High School, has always believed in the power of collaboration.  This is shown clearly in her latest post, encouraging parents on the many ways that they can be involved in the learning process as the high school level.  If you are interested, please take the time to visit the Memorial Composite High School ( Notes from the Office ) to keep up with the latest events!  Please read Shauna's message below:
It is fairly common for parents to become less involved with their son's and daughter's schools as their children get older. Often this is because it isn't as readily evident how they can participate. It is true, high school classrooms do not have a high need for parent-volunteers, and many opportunities to volunteer in other situations become more and more difficult to create. And of course, there is the small but powerful desire of many students not to see their parents in the school.
That does not mean, however, that involvement in your son or daughter's education becomes any less important. There are ways you can be involved at Memorial Composite that reward experiences for all.
Here are a few (in no particular order):
Join our School Counci l - School Council is a great opportunity to have input into school decisions and get direct information about what's happening in school
Attend Sporting Events - our student athletes love to see the stands full of Marauder fans! Even if your son/daughter doesn't play on the team, it's still a great way to spend an evening for free.
Attend Music and Drama productions - every performance runs much better in front of a packed house! We have some amazingly talented students here at MCHS who would love to showcase their abilities.
Volunteer to coach , or even drive a bus - we're always looking for people to help out so we can offer all of our athletic programs.  If you're not a talented athlete, perhaps you'd be willing to offer to drive a team to a game once in a while.
Is your occupation one that is immediately relevant to curriculum? Offer to Skype in or host a field trip in your place of work.
Is your son/daughter on a sports team or in music? Join the Green and Gold Society  or the  Music Parents' Association  - our fundraising committees for athletics and choir/band respectively.  We simply could not offer the calibre of extra-curricular opportunities we do without outside funds.
Do you have some construction, fabrication or artistic background? Our Drama program will probably need assistance in set production for their performances.
We have a number of major citizenship events open to the community. We hosted a very successful fundraiser for the Global Enrichment Foundation , and will soon begin to focus our efforts to raise funds for the General  Romeo D'Allaire Foundation  . Our first event went extremely well, but only through the amazing support of our students, staff, parents and community.  You would contribute greatly if you were able to volunteer time to prepare for our next event.
Of course, being involved does not only mean volunteering your time. Being involved in your child's education starts with becoming informed, thus opening the avenues of communication.
Touch base with your child's teachers and grade administrator - email or phone and introduce yourself. Don't wait until parent-teacher interviews, which by the way, are scheduled for November 4 and November 8 (5:00 - 8:00 PM).
Many of our teachers have facebook or twitter accounts they use to keep students updated and notify them of upcoming important dates. You can join those feeds too!
Read and review courses outlines your son/daughter brings home - they contain valuable information about procedures and how grades are calculated.
Check in about homework. Most students will have homework almost every day. Remain mindful of how much time your child spends on it and help them to balance school responsibilities with family/friends, and work commitments.
The key to a successful high school experience, for parents and students, is communication. We all want the same thing - for your sons and daughters to be happy, responsible, respectful, caring, and learned individuals. We want them to get everything they can out of high school and to achieve their potential.
I would love to hear your comments about other ways to get involved at Memorial Composite. Please feel free to add to the comment section below.

hello my names patrick and i attend memorial comp, For a class assighnment we are to comment on one blog and express our views and ask one qustion.
For me as a individual student i can say that i personally would rather not have my parents involved in my highschool life. The reason for this is that we are in highschool now and should not need our parents to be involved in everything we do, not that it is a bad thing to have them involved though, just to a certin extent. And do we really need the extra help around school or is it just to help the parents be involved?
Patrick, Thanks so much for commenting on this blog. I agree that there is a certain level of independence that must come as students get older. You indeed do not require your parents to be involved in everything you do, and I would suggest that most parents do not want that either. What I would argue, is that there are many ways that parents and other community members can be involved in schools that actually enhance your experience for you, and help to remove the barriers often found between teenagers and adults. If you played on a sports team, would you object to your parents and grandparents coming to watch? Wouldn't it be great if they also brought a couple of neighbours? What I think would be fabulous, is if they watched this game, returned at a later date to see a drama production or a choir concert, and then maybe even offered a class a field trip to a nearby work site that was directly related to topics being studied. This makes learning and school relevant to everyone, and in essence, creates a heightened learning experience for students, teachers, and community members. It's not so much about needing help at the school as it is about being part of the community. Like any good neighbour, we want to invite people in once in a while... S. Boyce
