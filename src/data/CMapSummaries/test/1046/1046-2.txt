OVERVIEW: Traditionally, parent involvement in education has included home-based activities (such as helping with homework, encouraging children to read, and promoting school attendance) and school-based activities (such as attending PTA meetings, parent-teacher conferences, concerts, and other school events; helping to raise money for various school-improvement projects; and volunteering at school during the day).
Epstein (1995) expands upon the traditional kinds of involvement by identifying six types of parent involvement in schools : parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community. Each type of involvement is valuable, and each has an impact on students, teachers, and the parents themselves.
Some parents readily volunteer their time for the schools. Other parents are reluctant or unable to participate. Although getting parents involved in their children's schools is a great challenge for educators, research shows that educators can do a great deal to promote greater parent involvement. The Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning (1994) indicates that parents who receive frequent and positive messages from teachers tend to become more involved in their children's education than do other parents. Dauber and Epstein (1993) found that many parents respond to encouragement from educators. In their national study of 2,317 inner-city elementary and middle school students, the best predictor of parent involvement was what the school did to promote it. School attitudes and actions were more important than the parents' income, educational level, race, or previous school-volunteering experience in predicting whether the parent would be involved in the school. Davies (1991) suggests three ways that schools can promote parent involvement : establishment of a parent center, a home visitor program, and action research teams.
School attitudes and actions toward parent involvement are largely influenced by administrators and teachers. Because leadership is critical, administrators may need special training to help them develop the skills needed to promote family-school partnerships. Don Davies, former U.S. Commissioner of Education and former president of the Institute for Responsive Education, states, "In any school...leadership is essential if a school staff is to choose the partnership approach to school reform.... In most cases, the leadership to reach out to the community will have to come from the principal" (Davies, 1991, p. 382).
Teacher-parent partnerships foster mutual support for teacher and parent roles, increase parent involvement in various school activities and improvement projects, and lead to positive growth for students (Swick, 1991). To promote such partnerships, the Family Involvement Partnership for Learning suggests that members of the school community develop a family-school compact for learning . Such a compact can capture the sustained effort required for successful partnerships.
Accommodate parents' work schedules when creating parent-involvement opportunities.
Assign homework projects that engage each child's parents and family and make learning more meaningful for the student, such as a family history, interviews with grandparents, or descriptions of parents' daily work.
Keep parents informed of their children's performance and school activities by means of notes, telephone calls, newsletters, conferences, and meetings.
Provide clear, practical information on home-teaching techniques for parents of children who need extra help at home.
Provide opportunities for parents to visit the school, observe classes, and provide feedback.
Allow employees occasional time during the work day to attend school conferences or volunteer at their children's schools.
Develop work strategies that enable parents to become involved in schools.
IMPLEMENTATION PITFALLS: For working parents, time constraints often prevent school involvement. Sixty-six percent of working parents indicate that they do not have enough time for their children (Families and Work Institute, 1994). Educators should make every attempt to plan school meetings, activities, and conferences at times when parents are available to attend. Employers need to be flexible with the work schedules of working parents and supportive of their efforts to be involved in their children's schools.
Some parents may have other reasons for not being involved with their children's schools:
"A growing number of parents do not speak or read English well enough to communicate with teachers and administrators. Because of cultural differences, many parents are not familiar with the expectations of their children's schools and don't understand how to go about getting involved, even if they want to. Some parents lack the educational background or skills they feel they need to interact with teachers and staff. For others, their own negative experiences as students make them uncomfortable going to the school." (Aronson, 1996, p. 58)
The language barrier may be a problem for parents who do not speak English. One solution is to have a resource person--either a teacher or another parent--who can communicate with the parents in their first language (Ballen & Moles, 1994). Another possible solution is to have children accompany their parents and act as translators at conferences and meetings.
Some parents lack the ability to read or are embarrassed about their lack of schooling. Educators should realize that not all parents are able to read newsletters, field trip forms, or homework assignments. They must not depend on the written word as the only form of communication with the home. Home visits, phone calls, one-on-one meetings, and other personalized contacts with parents are important.
Teachers who feel overburdened with their teaching load may not have the time to reach out to parents. They need to be given the necessary time to contact and meet with parents. To coordinate parent-teacher meetings and develop parent-involvement programs, the school may designate a parent liaison or home-school coordinator (Ballen & Moles, 1994).
Sometimes parents are frustrated because schools do not seem to know much about their children. Boyer (1995) notes, "The harsh truth is...that car mechanics often know more about the automobiles entering their shops than educators know about children who enroll in school" (p. 61-62).
It is important for schools to offer different forms of parent involvement; no one form of involvement is necessarily right for every family. Educators and parents should aim to increase the percentage of parents involved in at least some ways. Every school has at least some parents who are deeply involved; the key is to steadily increase this number.
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW: Although most educators and parents say they support parent involvement in schools, many parents appear to support a wider range of involvement opportunities than do educators. Various studies show that parents want to be more involved, and in a broader variety of ways (Williams &amp; Stallworth, 1984; Elam 1990). Educators sometimes are reluctant to have parents involved in decision-making roles with the school.
A recent Gallup poll (Elam, 1990) asked parents if they were satisfied with the amount of participation they had in their school. Fifty-nine percent said they wanted a greater voice in the way school funds were allocated, 53 percent said they wanted more say in what courses were offered, and 46 percent said they wanted more say in hiring administrators (versus 37 percent who said they had the right amount of say in hiring administrators).
Some universities appear to believe that training teachers and administrators how to work with parents is not especially important. Most states do not require prospective teachers or administrators or most teachers to take coursework or training in working with parents (Radcliffe & Nathan, 1994).
