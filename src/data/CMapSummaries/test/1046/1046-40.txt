Parent Leadership Institute
Cincinnati Public Schools is welcoming an enthusiasm for parental involvement that is taking parents' investment in student achievement to a higher level.
Examples include a parent who is helping her child's school improve students' success in mathematics, a parent who is creating enrichment opportunities for gifted children, and two parents who are linking families with the best resources for children with special needs.
Parents for Public Schools of Greater Cincinnati (PPSGC) sponsors the Parent Leadership Institute (PLI) as a way for parents to learn from each other, which helps overcome roadblocks to parents getting involved in their children's education.
These parents' involvement began as ways to help their own children's educations and grew into projects that now are benefiting many children  as well as sparking involvement from other parents. Their strongest contribution may be the examples they are setting of great parental involvement.
PLI teaches parents the skills they can use to impact academic achievement in their children's schools. Funded through the Greater Cincinnati Foundation and now the United Way  Ohio PIRC Grant, the institute aims to show parents how to turn information and data into projects that can help students learn. Each graduate receives $250 to build a team and launch an in-school project that identifies a need and a way to fulfill it.
Dorothy Darden and Howard Voner, graduates of the 2009 PLI class, developed a project that encourages parents to play a more active role in their child's education by tutoring both in the classroom, as well as at home. They can be seen, regularly, in the Parent Center at Rothenberg Preparatory Academy talking to parents about ways to support their children. The two also organized monthly Chic n' Chat meetings that bring parents together to share a meal and brainstorm about classroom and homework strategies, as well as challenges and successes.
PLI helped them focus on how they could solve the problems they were encountering and knew other parents were struggling with, too.
"The institute really empowers parents to advocate on the level of the administrators and teachers," Darden said. "It teaches skills that can help throughout your life. You can utilize your talents at many levels. The Parent Leadership Institute is a good starting point for getting involved."
Audrey Holtzman, a graduate who now is a Parent Coach with PPSGC, crafted her project around finding ways to bring more gifted programming to North Avondale Montessori. The institute taught her how to organize groups and to network to get projects accomplished. Her successes, so far, include parents coordinating a Brain Bowl quiz game and committing to the school's participation this year in the Scripps National Spelling Bee.  I wanted to get other parents involved, too, because you realize that the teachers and the district can't do it all,   Holtzman said.
Other examples of projects launched by institute graduates include Janet Albright-Willis' Family Math Night at Rees E. Price Academy, aimed at showing parents ways they can help children improve math achievement; and Pamela Carter's Parent Support Group at Roberts Paideia Academy, which started a child-development group to fill a need for before- and after-school child care.  Parent involvement  that's the key,  Carter said.  As parents, our obligation is to make sure our children get what they need. We have power in our numbers. Schools can only do so much. You have to be a major part of your child's education
