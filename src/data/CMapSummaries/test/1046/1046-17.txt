Real Parents Sharing Their Real Stories
The Georgia Department of Education and the Georgia Parental Information and Resource Center teamed up with Georgia Public Broadcasting to create "GET INVOLVED" video stories! These videos were filmed at both home and school and represent parents of students across all grade levels. Real parents telling their real stories were captured based on 15 ways parents can get involved in their child's education as listed on our "GET INVOLVED" brochure. The 15 parent videos along with an introduction video are listed below and available in English and Spanish. In addition to viewing them, we encourage you to put them on your website, show them at parent meetings and functions, and even play them on your local school cable channel.
Play a Role In Your Child's Success In School...
Schools understand that parents are busy people, but there are many different ways you can get involved in your child's education. No matter how little or how much time you have, there are many ways you can positively impact your child's education at school and at home. Check out the ways these parents have gotten involved and then think about what your "Best Get Involved Moment" is too! Remember when parents get involved and stay involved, all students achieve at higher levels.
