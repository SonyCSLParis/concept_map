Encourage Other Parents to Get Involved in School
You already know that being involved in your kids' education can help them be more successful in school. When you build a network with other parents and get them involved in school, you can do even more for the school and the kids. It takes a village to build strong, safe schools.

Take it from me :  "No government policy will make any difference [to our children's education] unless we also hold ourselves more accountable as parents."-Barack Obama
Use these steps to help you achieve your goal:
Call at least 5 different people and invite them to the next PTA/PTO or Boosters meeting. - Both organizations are always looking for new and enthusiastic members to join. Parents are much more likely to attend a meeting if they receive a personal phone call from another friendly parent.
Remember : Call different parents before every meeting throughout the year (not just the first meeting) --- your attendance could increase significantly.
Create a "Newcomers' Committee" with several other parents to welcome new parents to my kid's school. - Starting at a new school can be just as difficult for parents as it is for kids. Help ease their transition and get them involved in your school by meeting with them and answering any questions they may have. Tell them about your PTA/PTO, volunteerism opportunities, and special events they can attend and help with throughout the year.
Tip : Be sure to check with the principal of your school before you form your committee to make sure he or she isn't already planning some type of welcome event.
Volunteer at my school's back-to-school event in the fall. - Many PTA/PTO groups host some type of event at the start of the school year to welcome back parents and students, and they are always in need of extra volunteers. Ask to host a table where parents are encouraged to sign up for events or simply ask questions about the school. This will give you an opportunity to talk with other parents and encourage them to become involved in your school.
Meet with my child's teacher to set up a volunteer schedule to get more parents involved in the classroom. - Teachers usually welcome extra help in the classroom, and your child's teacher might really appreciate you taking the lead on contacting volunteers. Work with the teacher to set up a volunteer schedule that works for him or her and then call all the parents in the classroom - even if they didn't sign up to volunteer. It's a great way to reach out to everyone and encourage them to help in any way they can - even if it's just to donate plates for a class party.
Introduce myself to the PTA/PTO or Boosters Board members and offer my assistance with volunteerism. - You don't have to be on the Board of these organizations to help. Offer to create a new role that works to increase membership and bring in new volunteers. Brainstorm with the Board on new ways to reach more parents and encourage them to participate. When you have your ideas set, quickly implement the ones that reach out to new parents and then involve some more people to work with you on the other goals.
