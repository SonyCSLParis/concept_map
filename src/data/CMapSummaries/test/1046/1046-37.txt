Parents make the difference at Joaquin Miller
Becoming involved in your school is a great way to get to know your neighbors, it's lots of fun, and it helps out our kids tremendously.
Parent involvement can play a critical role in a child's academic and social development. At the same time, involved parents help build a sense of a community at a school, help the school offer services that it otherwise could not and have fun while doing it. Fortunately, there are many ways that parents can participate at Joaquin Miller:
Join the Joaquin Miller PTA
At Joaquin Miller we have traditionally enjoyed a membership rate of about 95% of our families: we encourage all families to join. PTA meetings are held at 7:00 p.m., on the third Thursday of each month of the school year. You'll find in attendance friendly and passionate parents, teachers, and the principal, working together to make our school the best it can be. Learn more "
