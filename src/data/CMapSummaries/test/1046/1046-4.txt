Parent resources: Get involved
To help your child to succeed in school, it's critical that you as a parent form a partnership with the school to help promote your child's social, emotional, and academic growth. No matter what your child's grade level, every parent should get involved at home, in the school and within the community. The end result will make a huge impact in your child's success.
