Learn to understand and resolve costly disputes Handling High Conflict Personalities in Litigation and Alternative Dispute Resolution Recent brain research provides insight into managing high conflict clients and opposing parties. Practical methods for connecting with and calming upset clients will be explained, along with methods of responding to hostile emails and staying calm while dealing with high conflict opposing parties, opposing counsel, and negative advocates. In litigation, there are predictable problems and sources of useful evidence. In mediation and collaborative divorce there is frequent resistance to settlement which may be overcome with increased structure and management skills. In parenting coordination and views of the child reports, there are factors which can increase or decrease resistance and conflict which will be addressed.
Managing High Conflict Personalities in Domestic Violence and Child Alienation Those with personality disorders "split" people into all good and all bad. This unconscious defence mechanism drives much of their abusive behavior, justifying violence in their minds and creating many false perceptions and false allegations. Four types of intimate partner violence will be discussed, including the role of personality disorders in patterns of power and control. Splitting also is contagious. Family members, including the children, often become "split", with pressure to take sides. These children absorb their high conflict parent's emotions and all-or-nothing views of each other, which increasingly appears as child alienation between some parents and children. Methods for dealing these problems will be addressed.
Ethics and Professional "Splitting" in the Practice of Family Law Ethical problems are common in high conflict cases, as people with personality disorders push normal boundaries, seek many favors, have a sense of entitlement, don't pay all their fees, and are the clients most likely to sue professionals. Civility is increasingly a problem, as professionals become "split" with personal conflicts arising between them. Ways to manage these families while preventing professional splitting will be presented. Other ethical problems raised by high conflict parties will be addressed, including unpaid fees, setting professional boundaries, managing unrealistic expectations and handling terminations with difficult clients. Ethical issues in mediation and collaborative law include confidentiality, deciding appropriateness for these alternatives, and determining when to terminate a case.
New Ways for Families New Ways for Families is a structured short-term counseling method for both parents and children in divorce, before big decisions are made. This new method is being used in the San Diego Family Court system in California. A videotape of a sample case will be shown and an explanation of its research basis and 4-step structure will be presented. A parent workbook guides the counseling, with required tasks both parents must complete. It teaches basic skills of flexible thinking, managed emotions, and moderate behaviors to parents who may have personality disorders. It teaches a reasonable parent methods for dealing with a high conflict other parent, including handling email responses, making proposals, and avoiding alienation. It can be applied in cases of domestic violence and child alienation, with no contact required between the parents. New Ways reduces the parenting contest by focusing both parents on their own behavior, and assists parents in teaching their children skills for resilience in divorce.
