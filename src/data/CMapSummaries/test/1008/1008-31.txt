Despite the underlying affection between family-members it is not uncommon for conflicts and disputes to mar good relations. The purpose of this article is to consider some of the ways we can negotiate the sometimes rocky territory of family living. Of course every family is composed of a unique mix of personalities and circumstances, but some general points may be of help.
Avoiding Tribalism
At best, the family is our greatest support-group and should be our first port-of-call when in trouble or experiencing distress. Close families present a united front to the world and can be a wonderful sanctuary and sounding-board for each member. Unfortunately even close families can sometimes be split and divide into factions, sometimes over a major event (for example the civil war, which divided many families across Ireland) or something less important (like issues of inheritance and probate). When conflict strikes a family it is important for each member to keep communicating with the others, even if they disagree about the issue at hand. It can be the case that families never recover from the discord of a major row. If possible it is best to avoid the family-group splitting into separate tribes based on which side of the argument you happen to be on. It is critical for each member to remember the positives about each individual as well as the current difficulties.
Often it requires a family-member who is less involved in the conflict to intervene and attempt to bring the parties together. But each member can set the tone for him or herself. Remember, you are not obliged to fall-out with anybody - you can simply disagree and refuse to get into a row. Then, later, it will be easier to effect reconciliation, even if others have gotten angry.
Above all, families should bear in mind how much they have to lose by splitting or dividing and act to minimise the fallout from disagreements.
More than any other family member, the parent's actions set the tone for family life. Parents should always seek to control their temper and behave reasonably when chastising their children. They should also be even-handed in the distribution of praise. They also need to be quick to mend fences following a row and avoid allowing bad feeling to fester over time. They should also take care not to drive a wedge between their children by expressing negative comparisons. Phrases like "Why can't you be more like your brother...?" can cause particular hurt and can damage the self-esteem of the child terribly. It is the responsibility of the parent to make each child feel loved and special - failure to do so can be very damaging for the child and can also drive a wedge between siblings, robbing them of an important relationship.
One of the most destructive forces enters the home when parents become divided. Parents should keep their disagreements to themselves and avoid playing them out loudly in front of the children - nothing makes a child more insecure than parental conflict. Oftentimes the row is loud and public but the making-up is quiet and private. Parents should act to reassure children that the conflict has been resolved and that everything is all right again.
Our brothers and sisters share with us our earliest and most person-forming experiences. They are a major influence on our development and on our self-image. Parents should encourage (and reward) good relations between siblings. It is especially important that older siblings are kind and loving to their younger brothers and sisters, who will look up to them and learn from them.
When siblings fall out they should be encouraged to settle their differences without recourse to violence or antagonism. This is an area where older siblings can be of great positive influence.
Parents can construct situations where all of the family engage in activities together and can gradually give the older siblings some responsibility for caring for the younger ones. This should be monitored and handled with care - the objective is to form a bond of protection and love, not to put pressure on the older child.
Outsiders and Invaders
One of the most difficult things for a family to cope with occurs when one member enters into a relationship with a person who does not seem appropriate or likeable to the rest of the family. Typically this happens when one of the children begins a romantic relationship with a person that some family members do not approve of.
Obviously the family-member who is involved with this person likes them a lot and will be at a loss to understand why their siblings and/or parents do not also like them.
These situations should be handled with care as they can cause rows and rifts very easily. However, people will often feel obliged to communicate their misgivings. Obviously this should be handled in a sensitive manner and with careful use of words.
If the relationship thrives it may be the case that this outsider will have to be tolerated for the sake of good relations within the family. It is particularly devastating for a person when they fall in love and find themselves frozen-out by their family, only to break-up with the object of their affections. Often they will blame the family for the break-up and the split may continue into the long-term.
Sometimes it is impossible to convince a loved one that a particular person is not good for them and you have to wait and be ready to support them when they discover this truth for themselves.
As stated at the outset, each family is unique and composed of a mix of personalities. This article has attempted to mention some important points but there are many other considerations. I look forward to reading your comments and seeing your thoughts on the message-boards.
