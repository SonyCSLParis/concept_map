Management in an educational institution is a unique challenge. Unlike managers of companies or government agencies, school principals and other administrators often find their authority limited by community-based boards of directors, as well as by the demands of the public at large. Further, the "product" of a school is an intangible that is difficult to measure, making performance equally difficult to quantify. Finally, ever-increasingly strained budgets put school administrators in what may feel like an impossible squeeze to meet the standards imposed upon them. Such conditions breed conflict throughout the system.
The Train-the-Manager (Track 2) option is ideally suited to school superintendents, principals, department heads, and other administrators. You will learn to perform "Managerial Mediation," a core leadership competency, and will receive a Coaching Video that demonstrates how to perform the core competencies for managing workplace conflict - an invaluable aid as you coach your staff in how to handle potentially disruptive and costly* conflict situations.
School personnel who provide professional services, such as psychologists and career guidance counselors, may prefer the Train-the-Professional (Track 3) option. You'll still receive the Coaching Video and all the other resources received by registering for Track 2.

The article discusses a study to understand a child's development when a peer problem solving model is applied in a classroom. The results show that the child's conflict resolution style changed from a power assertion style to a form of negotiation, to support the thought that young children can develop more advanced conflict resolution strategies when presented with the environment (constructivist-oriented classroom) to practice this technique.
Axtman, K. (2004). Recess backlash: Parents say it pays to play. Christian Science Monitor.
Educators, policy makers and parents struggle with the decision to either mandate or eliminate recess. Many administrators claim that there is not enough time in the day for recess especially given the fact that schools and educators alike are accountable for a rise in state tests. Frustrated parents however believe that recess contributes to the "whole child" approach and deem recess a necessary break to foster a fresh mind and consequently more learning.

This article is a literature review of the way conflict resolution and peer mediation systems are evaluated. The author contends that a mediation system is incomplete without an evaluation of the process and outcome. Authors usually look at the self-evaluations from the mediators and participants as well as observation from parents and teachers. The author makes the case for using more rigor around the evaluation of these systems in order to help educators and parents buy into a conflict management system. The author states that conflict resolution and peer mediation systems should prove their effectiveness like other tools.
Coleman, P. & Morton D. (2001). Introducing cooperation and conflict resolution into schools: A systems approach. In Peace, Conflict, and Violence: Peace Psychology for the 21st Century . Upper Saddle River, NJ, Prentice Hall.
This article is about illustrates how violence erupts and gives the reader several assumptions to guide prevention. It is apparent that schools have to change in basic ways in order to educate children that they are for rather than against one another, to equip them with the skills to resolve conflicts constructively rather than destructively, and to provide them with an orientation to problems and a set of norms and skills that enables them to fulfill their needs in a non violent manner. Also it is a mistake to assume that causes of school violence reside only or primarily in the school. Child abuse and neglect for example, contribute to the occurrence of violence but are largely not under school control. Nevertheless, there is much that schools can do to prevent violence and counteract harmful outside influences.

Concerns about the violence in schools have been increasing, and, correspondingly, conflict resolution and peer mediation training programs have been proliferating. These programs have been developed by researchers in the field of conflict resolution, advocates of nonviolence, anti-nuclear-war activities, and members of the legal profession. While there are numerous methodologies and conceptual problems with the research on conflict resolution and peer mediation programs, the current evidence indicates that 1) conflicts among students do occur frequently in schools, 2) untrained students by and large use conflict strategies that create destructive outcomes by ignoring the importance of their ongoing relationships, and 3) conflict resolution and peer mediation programs do seem to be effective in teaching students integrative negotiation and mediation procedures.

Lehmann, K.J. (2004). Surviving Inclusion. Harvard Educational Review Fall 2005.
Students with special needs deserve individual academic attention that best facilitates their needs. That being said, this book addresses how can students with special needs receive the appropriate attention while remaining a part of the general classroom. It offers many new ideas for teachers who are faced with inclusion and meeting the needs of all students. This is opposed to the "pull out method" where children's needs are addressed individually outside of the classroom or via mainstreaming which simply helped children with special needs within a classroom environment only a few hours a day.

Every school in the Virginia school district is required to begin the day with the Pledge of Allegiance. Administrators feel students without a philosophical or religious objection should be suspended for not adhering to the policy. Lawmakers and critics disagree given the notion that many students are not US citizens. The American Civil Leaders Union of Virginia however feel that teachers should allow students not to say the pledge if they don't want to.

Strauss, V. (2005, October 24). As 'No Child' answer, Tutoring generates complex questions. The Washington Post , p.A.10.
In an effort to address President Bush's No Child left Behind Act, low income students are being given tutors paid via the federal government. This simple plan unveiled a series of conflicts over who can tutor what, to whom and where. Conflicts also arise with parents as they determine the effectiveness of the program and battle over whether or not tutors should have access to school buildings. When private companies get involved in education this encourages a shift in federal spending toward the private sector rather than the public school district.

A discussion of peer mediation programs as an alternative to conflict resolution. The results of a peer mediation study show that there was a significant difference between traditional discipline (i.e. suspension) and those that received mediation. In particular it points out that those receiving traditional discipline encountered missed learning opportunities and lowered GPA's. The emphasis on empowerment and problem solving in peer mediation was a better alternative.

Winans, D. (2004). A Teacher's Worth. National Education Association.
This article reviews a case study's findings that teacher pay lags behind alternate comparable occupations despite the similarity in skill and responsibility. In 2003 inflation caused teachers to see a .8 percent increase in salary while there was an 11.8 percent increase for comparable occupations for college graduates. Teachers have less paid leave; fewer wage bonuses and less premium pay. Contradictory to the hard work of teachers ma
