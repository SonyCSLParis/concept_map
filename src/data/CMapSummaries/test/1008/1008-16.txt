(1A) Divorce in America: Survival Guide
The word divorce is common in most children's lives today. It doesn't have to be a bad word with a negative connotation. The goal of this book is to help parents learn how to move forward in their lives while maintaining a focus of how the divorce may be affecting their children. Divorce is a breakup of a relationship, not the destruction of another relationship e.g. the parent-child relationship). Although the emotional impact of divorce may be enormous for the adults involved, the focus in this manual is to minimize any negative impact of the divorce which children may be experiencing. We want children to continue to have a healthy relationship with each parent and to continue to be children! With a little insight, parents can raise healthy children if their focus is on The Children's Best Interests!
Extensive studies of the divorce experience have provided us with an idea of what lies ahead. Most divorcing couples know there will be major changes, but they usually underestimate them and do not anticipate how unsettling these changes may be. Divorce sets into motion a chain of events that spans over time. What happens over that time will influence how well your children bounce back and whether they develop delayed adjustment problems. By understanding the emotional, legal, and psychological process of divorce, you will be better equipped to deal with the stressful process.
Single parent families in America have continued to grow over the past 25 years. Most experts agree that approximately one of every two marriages end in divorce. For second marriages, approximately 60% end in divorce. Forty percent of failed re-marriages never make it past their 4th year. Over 1,000,000 children are affected by divorce per year. The standard of living for mothers and children usually declines markedly after divorce, leaving the new family in financial duress, also likely to effect a child's long-term adjustment. More than half will grow up in families where parents remain angry. Dr. Joanne Rocklin, who performed extensive studies with divorcing couples, concluded that continued conflicts between parents is the most harmful aspect of a divorce and the most dentrimental to the children.
Parental support at this critical time can be the most powerful buffer from the severe stress during a time when children usually feel rejected, abandoned, and hurt. During this stressful period, parents may feel overwhelmed with their own stress and emotions, however, it is crucial for parents to recognize their children's needs. It is important for parents to help children understand that the loss is that of the current family structure, not of a parent. The parental roles will continue.
The duration of children's difficulty usually coincides with the turmoil taking place in the family. Problems begin to fade as parents regain their own emotional stability and are able to provide more nurturance and support. Therefore, it is important for parents to take care of themselves physically, and emotionally so they can be available to meet their children's needs. It is also vital that parents recognize the ongoing parental role before, during and after the termination of the marriage. In general, problem behavior is likely to continue for at least 18 months following separation if turmoil exists between the parents. The process is easier for children who were well adjusted before the divorce.
Based on studies, most children do adjust successfully to their parents' divorce if parents create the needed conditions. Clear limits, consistency and rules will help children develop internal controls necessary to manage their behavior. Long term problems may persist in families who remain in a chronic state of stress, instability and continued open conflict. It is important to recognize that current life circumstances play a critical role in children's long-term problems.
Chapter 2
Navigating through the Divorce Process
(2A) What is the initial stage of Divorce and how do I help my children through it ?
By now experts agree divorce is not an event that takes place in a person's life but an ongoing process. Just as people maneuver through other life stages differently, people will also have different experiences going through a divorce. While there are some general sign posts to be aware of, there are no exact guidelines to describe each and every divorce and how people will deal with various issues.
The first formal step in the divorce process is when one or both spouses decides they want to separate. Deciding to separate can mean either a physical separation where one spouse moves out of the family home or it can be a separation where both parents remain in the home for an indeterminate amount of time. At the time when most couples are ready to move forward with a divorce, usually there are separate households. The early stages of physical separation can be characterized by a sense of emotional relief, especially if living together was particularly stressful or if trying to work out problems became unbearable. Children often experience some relief as well because they are not faced with the day to day stress of the parent's marriage.
In other families, physical separation can be more challenging, especially for the parent who does not want the separation. In these instances parents will need to work hard to deal with the painful emotions of separating. Parents who can successfully deal with their own emotional issues during this time are much better equipped to help their children through the process. When a parent does not have an outlet to express the emotions they are feeling they are more likely to make decisions that will negatively impact their children.
On the other hand, parents who find ways to discuss what is going on for them and get objective feedback and encouragement are more likely to evaluate choices and make decisions that are in their children''s best interest. Parents and children both suffer when parents allow the negative emotions they feel toward their spouse to dominate their interactions. If this is not possible to refrain from arguing, then at least they should make sure their children are out of sight and hearing distance so they are not exposed to the arguing and mud slinging that often accompanies such discussions. Although most children are well aware that their parents are having problems, it does little good for them to be constantly exposed to it. The biggest and most important challenge for parents at this stage is to minimize the amount of conflict children are exposed to.
Adults whose parents divorced when they were children often report that the most difficult thing for them was the intensity of their parents conflict and feeling like they were caught in the middle. In some instances children who survived such a divorce may repeat similar destructive patterns in their own relationships. However, many children thankfully learn from their parents' mistakes and work hard to create a different environment for their own kids even if they decide to divorce. This is most likely to happen if children can feel a continuing loving relationship with both parents. A key point for parents to remember is that their child's reactions to the divorce will most often mirror their own reactions. The challenge for parents is to focus their attention on dealing with their own issues to the best of their ability. Trying to get the other parent to change can be a trap. Although it is frustrating to be doing all the right things and watching the other parent make mistakes, KEEP DOING THE RIGHT THING. You can only change yourself, not others.
(2B) How do we (I) tell our kids we are getting divorced?
One way to help children through this early stage of the divorce process is (according to age) to tell them what is happening in the family. In some cases, it makes more sense for children to hear about the decision to separate from both parents. If this is the case, you will want to be sure that you repeatedly tell your children that both parents will always love them and they will always be a family. The only difference will be that there will be two households. Address any concerns they may have regarding their need to maintain a relationship with both parents. Be sure that your children understand their relationship with both parents is forever and that they will not be abandoned. A divorce does not end your child's relationship with either parent! The marital relationship may end, however, the parent-child relationship will continue.
The other message to get across when deciding to separate is that in no way did the children cause the divorce, nor are they able to keep their parents together. If the idea of parents separating is completely new to the child, it is important that they understand that every effort will be made to ensure that as much as possible, the child's life will remain the same. Keep in mind that children especially ages 5 through 12) will ask the same questions over and over with respect to the separation and divorce. This is normal and it is their way of gaining a sense of security and re-assurance about the future. It is important to keep your answers simple and consistent.
Of course, when one parent is being questioned apart from the other, that parent should make every effort to reinforce the message that the separation/divorce is taking place because of differences between the parents. These conversations should be conducted without damaging or disparaging remarks about the other parent. Children will adjust to their parents separation/divorce more easily when parents can show a healthy sense of respect and caring for the other parent despite difficult circumstances.
(2C) What is Co-Parenting and how do we do it once we are divorced ?
Co-Parenting responsibilities apply to all parents whether they are married or divorced. The extent that parents can effectively co-parent their children greatly determines how children will adjust to changes in family structure and dynamics. The parent who has primary residential custody deals with most of the day to day issues that affect the child's welfare. When more global decisions must be made, such as those that concern religion, discipline, financial, moral, social, recreational, legal matters, medical care, education and emergencies, it is beneficial for both parents to discuss these issues and make decisions jointly. It is important to remember that most married parents have differing ideas about all or some of these issues. There is no reason to assume that divorced parents should always agree on them either. The important point to remember is that how you deal with those differences is more important than simply having those differences. It is far better for parents to agree to disagree and work out some compromises than to argue and fight endlessly for their own way.
To accomplish this, you must be ready to compromise on some issues. One useful idea to keep in mind is that you must choose your battles carefully. If you are very invested in a system for dealing with school related issues, like completing homework and punctuality, then let these concerns be known to the other parent. However, while you may be concerned what your child eats when with the other parent, you might not want to dictate what should be eaten at meals when they are with the other parent. Parents need to give each other space to parent and let each other know that they feel the other is competent in certain areas of parenting and reinforce these regularly. Most parents have some redeeming qualities when it comes to their kids.
Divorcing parents that strive to cooperate with each other are more likely to make decisions that are in the best interests of children. In fact, nurturing an overall spirit of cooperation is more important than parents agreeing on any one particular issue. Also, parents who learn to put aside their own personal issues with the other parent when dealing with issues that involve the children are more likely to be looked on favorably by the court and usually have an easier time getting through the divorce process. On the other hand, parents who consistently argue and fight with one another make life difficult not only for their children but for themselves. Learning to relate on a mature level with a healthy sense of respect for the other parent even in the face of great differences, and in some cases bad feelings, is the challenge for every parent during the divorce process. Parents who are able to foster such an environment send very strong positive messages to their children about love, life, change, and family relationships. On the other hand, parents who operate with their own agenda, and who do not make special efforts to create a peaceful environment for their children foster angry, bitter feelings in their children who may have a difficult time later in life with their own intimate relationships.
(2D) How do I keep a stable environment for my kids and myself through the divorce process ?
Divorce brings about many changes in the lives of both parents and children. One of those changes for children may be in their immediate support network. This might include a loss of friendships and school ties if the divorce requires moving. It might also include changing relationships with extended family members after the divorce. To minimize stress on your children and ultimately yourself, you should attempt to keep your lifestyle as close to what it was prior to the divorce.
If possible, keeping friends, family, school, and other community support systems stable is usually a good idea in most cases. When changes are necessary, make sure you give your children ample notice as to what the changes will be and when they will occur. The more comfortable parents are with such changes the more comfortable their children will be.
In the days just after the legal aspects of the divorce are over, there is an adjustment period that can last for several weeks and oftentimes several months. This period may include adjusting to new routines, schedules, and living situations. In addition, it may take time for life to appear normal again. But don't worry, eventually it will. Children will adapt in different ways, even within the same family. Some kids are open about their feelings about the divorce and the changes it brings. Others will be less vocal about them. This too is normal and it may be a mistake to force kids to talk about their feelings.
(2E) Checklist for a Stable Home Environment
Spend time with each child individually each day.
Be nurturing, supportive, and available.
Create routines and schedules.
Provide clear rules and limits and use consistent discipline.
Settle custody as quickly and as amicably as you can; try mediation if you cannot agree.
Develop a firm parenting schedule that provides frequent and regular contact with the non-resident parent.
Avoid very frequent change-overs between homes if custody is joint.
End parental conflict, at least within the child's earshot.
Support children's relationships with their other parent and that parent's extended family.
Do not burden children with adult responsibilities.
Do not rely on children to be your confidants or companions.
Seek out other sources of social support for your children.

Chapter 3
The Legal Process
(3A) What do all these legal terms mean and who are all of these people in our lives ?
When one or both parents decide to get legal counsel, it marks the introduction of the legal system into their lives. Some couples decide to tell their attorney from the start that they are seeking an amicable settlement without a lot of conflict. This of course is recommended. In this case, you will want to find an attorney who is not interested in fanning any negative flames or advocating for an adversarial experience. For most couples, getting their own attorneys is still the norm, however there are increasing numbers of couples looking for alternatives. Either way, it is usually a good idea to choose an attorney who will work from a collaborative perspective because this is in everyone's best interest. A referral from a friend or colleague is usually a good idea but feel free to interview several attorneys. Many attorneys will do an initial consultation for free, to let you see if there is a good fit with you and your specific situation. In most states, the decision to proceed with the dissolution of marriage requires that couples begin to deal with issues like the division of property, child support, and primary residential custody of the children. In most cases these issues are settled out of court between the divorcing parents through their attorneys. Most judges in family courts believe divorcing parents should be able to complete the separation and divorce without having a formal trial. It is hoped that a court trial will be used only as a last resort.
Today, many couples are utilizing the services of family mediators to help with the divorce process. Mediators can be court appointed or couples can seek out a mediator themselves. Mediators are usually attorneys or mental health professionals who have specialized training in conflict resolution. A good mediator will help divorcing parents identify all the issues they need to consider, clarify both parent's goals and objectives, and help evaluate different options for reaching an acceptable agreement to both parties. A skilled mediator can often help parents accomplish this with little or no conflict. A big part of the mediator's job is to keep parents focused on the issues and the problems at hand and not on attacking one another. In most instances parents are encouraged to attend mediation without individual attorneys present. However, in some situations it makes sense for each parent to have their own legal representation.
(3B) Legal terms used in the courts for the dissolution of marriage .
Best Interest of the Child: This is the court's goal in addressing child related issues. The needs of children will be placed ahead of the needs of the parents in the divorce settlement.
Shared Parental Custody: Both parents have full and shared parental rights and responsibilities with respect to their child/children. In addition, parents are strongly encouraged to reach agreement on the foreseeable major decisions that will affect their child's welfare. Shared parental responsibility is the way most divorced cases are settled when abuse is not a concern.
Primary Residential Parent or Custodian: The parent who is ultimately responsible for coordinating the needs of the child and assuring that the child is enrolled in school, has proper inoculations, medical treatment, clothing, food, etc. This parent's residence is the legal address of the child for school attendance purposes; in practice, the child generally spends more time at this residence.
Sole Parental Custody: When one parent is awarded and assumes complete care, custody, and decision making for child rearing. Sole Parental Custody is usually only awarded if shared responsibility would be harmful to the child.
Secondary Residential Parent: The parent who maintains full rights and responsibilities, but whose residence is not listed as the legal address of the child. The child will spend time in this residence during times that have been mutually agreed upon by the parents, or ordered by the court.
Guardian Ad Litem: A court appointed person (oftentimes an attorney or specially trained layperson) to serve as representative for the children's best interests during divorce proceedings. This person is a trained specialist who, when necessary, may be appointed by the court to represent the best interests of the child during a disputed divorce.
Mediation: The process of finding a mutually acceptable settlement to the disputed issues in the divorce. The process involves meeting with a professionally trained third party who can assist the parties in finding options that may work for the children as well as for the divorcing parties.
Marital Settlement Agreement: A document which spells out the decisions that have been made by the parties with regard to child related issues, child support, distribution of marital property and other issues related to the dissolution of marriage.
Child Support: An amount of money which has been determined by state formula and is designed to meet the child's basic needs. The formula is based on the incomes of both parents, with each being responsible for a percentage of the total amount. The secondary residential parent typically pays child support to the primary residential parent.
Parent-Child Access (visitation): A schedule of days and times, including holidays, vacations, etc., which defines the time the child will be with each parent. Parents may choose a structured or a flexible schedule. In determining custody arrangements the courts usually base their opinion upon the following:
Typically, the courts have attempted to insure that minor children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents after parents separate or divorce. Parents are also expected to share the rights and responsibilities of raising children. Parents who permit frequent contact with the other parent and are amicable in their dealings with each other are acting in the best interest of the children and the court will look favorably on such actions.
One issue that is being addressed in several courts recently is that of parent alienation syndrome (PAS). PAS is defined as a disorder that arises primarily in the context of child custody disputes. For PAS to be deemed present, a parent must be actively engaged in the denigration against the other parent, a campaign that has no justification. It results from the combination of programming (brainwashing) parent's indoctrination and the child's own contributions to the vilification of the targeted parent. If, however, the alienation can be justified because of actual documentation of abuse or neglect, and the alienation is necessary for the child's safety and well-being, PAS w could not be an appropriate designation or explanation for the children's feelings or the alienating parents' actions.
Final Judgment: A document signed by the judge, officially ending the marriage and defining the terms of the divorce by Court Order.
Modification of Final Judgment: A change in the Final Judgment based on a request from either party, and approved by the divorce judge.
(3C) How does the court decide if we will have shared parental responsibility and which one of us will have the primary residence ?
When evaluating questions of shared parental responsibility and primary residence, several factors are examined by the courts. In considering the best interests of children, unquestionably it is best if both parents are comfortable with the arrangement they have worked out and can implement it with a high level of confidence. When parents are unable to accomplish this on their own, the best interests of children are left to the court where issues like, but not limited to the following are resolved:
(3D) Checklist for a Stable Home Environment
The parent who is more likely to allow the child frequent and continuing contact with the non-residential parent.
The parent who attempts to put the needs of the child over any personal or vindictive motivations.
The parent who shows the propensity to provide the child with love, caring, concern, food, clothing, medical care and other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws of the state.
The length of time the child has lived in a physically and emotionally stable environment where the child can be shown to be thriving.
The perceived stability of a given residence and the ability of a parent to preserve the existing family lifestyle and activities if such are deemed proper and healthy to the child/children.
The perceived values and morality of the parents.
The mental and physical health of the parents.
The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent child relationship between the child and the other parent.
Any other fact the court considers to be relevant and in the best interest of the child.
(3E) How do we deal with Financial Issues ?
Economics are a big consideration in the divorce process. It is estimated that over one third of all marriages that end in divorce can be attributed in part to differences over financial matters. One of the biggest challenges for divorcing couples is dividing their money and financial assets. Some parents can sit down with one another and equitably divide their assets. When this is possible it can actually save a lot of money in attorney's fees. The more parents can agree to on their own, the better. Should a person feel however, that any agreement is not in their best financial interest, they should consult an attorney for expert advice. However, as previously mentioned, you should interview several attorneys before retaining one's services and you should feel comfortable that he/she understands your needs and is not interested in fostering an adversarial relationship with the other spouse.
Discussing financial issues can be one of the most challenging issues for divorcing parents. It can also foster some very bitter feelings in parents if one or both parents feel that finances have not been settled equitably. Most people do not realize the full financial realities of divorce until they are deep into the divorce process. Typically families will have to make moderate to large changes in their financial lifestyle after a divorce. As with other pressing issues of divorce, it is best not to involve children in discussions about money. Children will feel more secure if they see parents handle adult matters like financial issues themselves.
One of the most common areas of potential conflict involves late payment or non-payment of child support. When this occurs, one parent may be tempted to use visitation rights of the other parent as a way of forcing child support payments. Parents should never take this approach. It is better to try and resolve these issues with the other parent directly. If this does not work, then you should probably consult your attorney to help set things straight. Keep in mind that while you are trying to settle finances you still have a responsibility to your children. That responsibility extends through times when parents are having conflict around money matters. In this regard, many parents think that because they do not openly bad mouth or bash the other parent that their children do not know how they really feel. This is usually not the case. Children are acutely aware of parents' feelings for one another even when there are no overt negative actions or behaviors. Regarding the issue of child support, it should be paid and paid on time. When for some reason this is not possible, parents should talk about the problem and make every effort to work it out to the satisfaction of both. Again, a child should not be used to help settle money problems and every effort should be made to settle the difficulty between the parents. In addition, the more active a parent is in the life of a child, the more likely that parent will be to make child support payments and make them on time. It is the parents' responsibility to provide for the children economically and emotionally before, during and after the divorce!

Chapter 4
How to Build a Working Co-Parenting Relationship .
(4A) How should we act toward one another after the divorce ?
Becoming co-parents and mastering the art of working together for your children's sake is the most beneficial thing parents can do for their children. Parents who make a successful transition from being a married couple to cooperative parents in the raising of their kids are in a better position to create a healthy emotional environment for their children. Children need to maintain a healthy relationship with both parents. The loss of the previous family structure is a transition for children. The loss of the relationship with a parent can be devastating.
It may be helpful to consider the relationship with your co-parent like that of a casual acquaintance or colleague at work. This is undoubtedly easier said than done. Yet, when parents make a special effort to do this consistently it becomes second nature. Also, this consistency is good for the other parent and it often times encourages them to adopt this same stance with you. If you think about it, you do not have to like someone to work productively with them. Many parents feel guilty, angry, or hurt by what happened during a marriage or divorce. The more you can leave these feelings out of your dealings with the other parent after the divorce the better for everyone.
As you are fostering a working relationship with your co-parent, you will begin to see that when you come together you are there to do a job. That job is the joint care and concern for your children and that should be your focus of interaction. If there are few negative feelings between you, and you respect and even like each other, this is all the better.
It is important to keep in mind that each parent is taking on a new role as residential and non-residential parent. Your feelings about how the other parent should handle a situation may differ, as they probably did while you were married. Your feelings and emotions as residential or non-residential parent may alter how you choose to deal with situations in the future. Try to understand that the other parent is in a different role which may prevent them from handling a situation as you think they should. Allow for differences. Your children will adjust to differences in the way each of you parent and may come to appreciate that there is more than one way to communicate with them.
(4B) How do I deal with a difficult parent ?
If you are dealing with a parent who simply will not cooperate or negotiate under any circumstances, and you are certain that it is not because of your behavior or attitude in the co-parenting process, dealing with them around co-parenting issues will be a challenge. There may be some unresolved anger existing between the parents creating an emotional atmosphere which prevents both parents from remaining focused on the child's best interest. Keep in mind that you never want to stoop to their level. This involves getting sucked into historical arguments. Leave the issues of your marriage in the past and resist playing out these never ending conversations that just leave everyone frustrated, angry and tired. You will no doubt feel a pull to engage in these conversations but they are dead-ends to cooperative parenting after a divorce. If you simply refuse to engage the other parent on matters that do not directly or indirectly impact your child's life, than leave it alone. If you do this consistently, even the most difficult parents usually get the message.
You will also want to keep good records when dealing with a difficult parent. Keep accurate track if they are keeping their commitments to the original agreements regarding custody, visitation, access to the other parent, keeping appointments, and providing consistent positive messages to the children. If you are faced with a parent who refuses to keep to the agreed upon schedule or is putting your children at serious physical or emotional risk, then consulting with legal counsel may be necessary.
(4C) How do I establish consistent discipline when my efforts are constantly undermined every other weekend by my ex ?
Prior to the divorce both parents probably handled discipline problems with one parent being firmer than the other. After the divorce they don't have a backup style to take over when one partner is less firm. Children will be subjected to two different sets of rules, or lack of rules, at each parent's home. Initially, the residential parent may have difficulty maintaining consistency due to the emotional turmoil and the added responsibility of being a single parent. Consistency may be difficult before the divorce, but it is extremely important after the divorce.
The non-residential parent may find it difficult to discipline the children since he/she has little quality time with them. His/her authority may also be undermined by negative comments which may have been made by the residential parent, which would result in more permissiveness during visitation. Generally, it takes extra effort from the residential parent to discipline the children when they come home. This inconsistency is to be expected, and is usually not deliberate, as new relationships are established between each parent and their child. How do I separate how I feel about my co-parent from how I need to relate to them as an important figure in my child's life?
Developing a new sense of objectivity about your ex-spouse as a parent can be difficult. This is especially true in cases where there was a lot of bad or difficult feelings prior to the divorce. It is helpful to remember that what you have in common now is your interests in the health and well-being of your children. The issues that were alive in your marriage must seep into the background when dealing in the here and now about your children. If you find yourself overwhelmed with feelings of bitterness, hurt, anger, or jealously, you will probably want to deal with these on your own with your support system or a good therapist. Instead you want to cultivate a desire and ability to concern yourself with the health and well-being of your children. If you are able to put difficult feelings aside and deal with them appropriately on your own, you are more likely to focus on the strengths of the other parent and what positive attributes they bring to their relationship with your children.
(4D) How do I balance my children's needs with my own needs ?
It is important for parents to realize that sometimes focusing on their own needs is also helping their children. Children, especially young children, will feel a sense of security if they feel their parents are doing all right emotionally. The critical thing to remember is that how you get your needs met is extremely important. Make sure you look for healthy outlets like counseling with a professional therapist, meeting with friends, support groups, or activities that bring you pleasure. If you don't find a way to take care of yourself through the process, you will be more likely to lose track of what your children need as you struggle with your own feelings. For example, if you are angry or depressed, you may project these feelings onto your children and assume they are angry or depressed. When this occurs, you are more likely to use your children in an unhealthy way to justify your own feelings. One way parents are tempted to deal with these feelings is to limit the time a child spends with the other parent. This process most often occurs outside a parent's awareness. Simply not saying anything bad about the other parent is not enough. Most kids are perceptive enough to read their parent's non-verbal behavior well enough to know how they are feeling. By getting support for yourself, you are less likely to use the children in unhealthy ways.
It is also a mistake to assume that the children feel exactly the way you do about things. For example, you may assume that if you feel betrayed or rejected by your ex-spouse that your children feel the same way. Remember, the relationship your children have with their parents is different from the relationship parents have with each other. It would be a mistake to think that parents and children are experiencing separation and divorce in exactly the same way. If you suspect this may be happening in your family, make special efforts not to confuse your loss with their loss.
One of the most important ways parents can provide for the needs of their children during a divorce is to work out a parenting plan. A parenting plan is a detailed account of how the parents will co-parent their children. A good parenting plan covers many areas of a child's life and is designed to be flexible enough to meet the changing needs of children as they get older.
(4E) What is a Parenting Plan used for ?
A well-thought-out and executed parenting plan is one of the most important tools for ensuring the health and well-being of your children. A good parenting plan will outline how parents will carry out their co-parenting responsibilities. It should also describe in detail how the parents will handle the day to day lives with their children and getting them back and forth between the two households. By necessity the parenting plan is a living document that must evolve with the needs of growing children. Therefore, you do not have to include every potential situation you may encounter in the parenting plan. However, it must be revisited regularly to make sure it meets the needs of your family.
A good parenting plan will also include ideas about how both parents will work to maintain a close and loving relationship with their children. This inevitably will involve parents being agreeable to certain terms and conditions but also being flexible, because life cannot always be lived on a set and rigid schedule. This means that in certain circumstances parents will have to accommodate to the needs of the other parent. These times should be the exception and not the rule however. Keep in mind that when you make room for the other parent with flexibility and understanding you are helping your children, again assuming that they are not taking advantage of the situation. If you feel you are being taken advantage of by a parent who will simply not abide by the parenting agreement, then steps must be taken to rectify this.

Chapter 5
(5A) Children's Developmental Stages
All children are affected by divorce. How parents help their children through this difficult time will help to determine whether or not the effects will become long term. Each age group has its own unique set of problems, however, many children experience sadness, anger, anxiety, fear, rejection, and loneliness. There is no clear-cut evidence that divorce is easier on one age group than another. Children react differently at different ages.
It is important to talk with your children about divorce. Include age appropriate information to help them gain a better understanding of residential and visitation issues and the expected economic impact on everyone involved. Allow your children the opportunity to ask questions and encourage them to express their emotions. By allowing your children to express their concerns and feelings about divorce, you are not only keeping the lines of communication open, but you are also helping them learn methods of coping with their emotions. Reassurances of love each parent has for the children is vital during this transition time.
(5B) How are Infants and Toddlers affected by the divorce experience ? Infants and toddlers are affected by divorce because of the stress and tension transmitted to them by their parents, changes in their routines, and lapses in their care due to their parents' distress. Infants reacting to stress may develop eating and digestive problems, become fussy and aggressive, or wake up more often crying during the night. Toddlers most commonly react to stress by becoming irritable and aggressive, have temper tantrums, and regress to earlier forms of behavior. If they develop pronounced fears about separating from a parent, they may wake up crying during the night.
(5C) How can I help my infant or toddler ?
Infants and toddlers need a stable environment and regular schedule. Consistency, stability, and routines are very important. Frequent contact with the non-custodial parent, as opposed to separation from the primary care giver for long stretches of time is best. Infants have a limited memory, so it is recommended that the nonresident parent spend a few hours with an infant every two or three days, engaging in lots of cuddling, talking, and playing. This type of interaction on a regular basis, along with the parent's responsiveness will determine how securely the attachment will be.
When the toddler is 18 months old, more liberal guidelines for visitation may be indicated. Each situation is different and must be evaluated based on the individual child's needs. Engage in lots of play and cuddling while trying to maintain a schedule your toddler is comfortable with. Continue with at least one contact in between, along with a brief phone contact as well. If overnight stays are indicated, and signs of stress emerge, return to a daytime schedule.
(5D) How are Preschoolers affected by divorce ? Ages 3 to 5
Preschoolers perceive their parents as a single unit. When one leaves, they become terrified that the other will abandon them. Routine separations are very difficult, and bedtimes become traumatic due to fears that they will wake up to an empty house. During this age, preschoolers perceive that the world revolves around them; therefore, the divorce is in some way their fault and the departing parent is rejecting them.
They are overwhelmed with anxiety and express it in ways which create difficulty for already emotionally drained parents. They become irritable, clingy, whiny, aggressive, and engage in temper tantrums. Due to their feelings of insecurity, they generally regress to younger behavior which can last from a few weeks to a few months.
(5E) How can I help my preschooler ?
Preschoolers can be helped by a consistent, predictable, and frequent schedule with a nonresident parent. Consistency and stability are important in order for the preschooler to avoid feeling rejected by the nonresident parent. Children this age are developmentally self-centered and need to be told that the divorce is not their fault and that their behavior did not contribute to the breakup. This will help to reduce their feelings of guilt.
Parents can reduce the source of their child's stress by maintaining a daily routine, eliminating any open conflict, and gaining emotional stability for themselves. Parents need to avoid speaking negatively about the absent parent and focus more on giving emotional permission for their child to stay connected to the absent parent. Telephone contact between parents and children should be encouraged.
(5F) How are 6 to 8 Year Old Children affected by Divorce ?
Children at this age, particularly boys, experience intense sadness and grief. They feel the most loss and despair and yearn for their absent parent. Parents have become their role models and are the center of their lives, and the child may believe their intact family is vital to their survival. Common depressive reactions such as crying, looking sad, withdrawing from pleasurable activities and being overly quiet interfere with concentrating in school and relating to peers.
Parental conflict is very difficult for them because they desperately want to be loyal to both parents. They feel like they are being torn in half. A child's self-esteem is lowered because the child is helpless to prevent the divorce from occurring. If anger is expressed, it is usually expressed indirectly rather than directing it at their parents. They may engage in fights with peers, refuse to go to bed or do homework or take care of their routine chores.
(5G) How can I help my 6 to 8 year old child ?
It is important to reassure the child that he/she is important in the lives of both parents and that the divorce is not his/her fault. The non-resident parent must be particularly reassuring and try to see the child as often as possible. The residential parent can help by scheduling special time with the child and engaging in recreational activities.
Consistency and routines along with support from relatives, friends and teachers is helpful. Parents need to avoid blaming and name-calling. Children this age use the image of their parent to base their ideas about who they are. The child needs to see the good in both parents to help define the good in themselves.
Frequent contact by phone and in person should be encouraged. Parenting schedules need to accommodate to the child's social activities as peers and outside activities become more important.
(5H) How are 9 to 12 Year Old Children affected by Divorce ?
Children this age rely on their parents' values in establishing their own. They continue to seek parental acceptance to increase their self-esteem. They tend to see things as black or white, right or wrong and live by very rigid rules. Their sense of loyalty is challenged and the child can become enraged if he/she feels the parent is not being fair. Their sense of identity and of right and wrong dominates them.
The most common reaction is intense anger that they direct at one or both parents, usually whomever they blame for the divorce. They accuse their parents of being selfish and inconsiderate of their needs. The child may choose to form an alliance with one parent (usually the one who was hurt). This alliance provides them with some power in a situation where they feel helpless and angry. Generally, the alignments do not last longer than a year, during which time visitation with the non-resident parent declines significantly. Many children grow up feeling guilty about the role they played and resent the parent they were aligned with for using them as weapons to hurt the other parent.
Physical complaints, such as headaches and stomach aches are frequently expressed. Other problem behaviors include physical fights with peers or siblings, and increased verbal aggressiveness directed at one or both parents over daily rules or type of clothing worn.
(5I) How can I help my 9 to 12 year old ?
Addressing the anger your child feels is most important. Anger is a sign of pain. Parents should be firm and consistent with rules and expectations. It is important for both parents to stress the good points about the other parent to the child, because they are building their self-concept on their parental images.
Involve your child in healthy distractions from family life such as sports, clubs or hobbies. Be supportive of their activities with their friends. Try to set up a routine in which each parent spends individual time with each child. These children need to have faith in the stability of the new family structure. Parenting schedules need to accommodate to the child's activities and commitments.
(5J) How are Adolescents affected by Divorce ?
Adolescents tend to react with a deep sense of loss, grief, anger, feelings of emptiness, difficulty concentrating, and chronic fatigue. Teens also become concerned about their future and whether their parents' divorce foreshadows their own future relationships. The depth of their emotional feelings and capacity for self-reflection deepens their feelings of anger, sadness, and shame.
As adolescents attempt to gain more independence, they move away from their families and then temporarily move back to the security of the family to regroup. The family is their safe place to retreat. Divorce threatens their safe haven and they feel as if they have been thrown out into the world before they are ready. When teens are not ready to be thrust ahead, they may express their distress and internal conflicts in potentially dangerous ways: alcohol, drugs, promiscuity, and delinquent activities. Other problem behaviors stemming from anger include physical fighting, destruction of property, poor grades, skipping school, stealing, and chronic family friction.
(5K) How can I help my Adolescent ?
Identifying a problem can be difficult because of the normal changes that take place during adolescence. Open communication and mutual respect with the teen can help to alleviate some of the anger and internal conflict the adolescent is experiencing. Consistency with regard to limits and rules is important, while maintaining the importance of flexibility as your teen matures. Allow your teen the freedom to develop outside interests and relationships. Provide your teen with a strong, stable home environment so that he/she will feel comfortable establishing and spending time outside of the home with a peer group. Many adolescents distance themselves from the crisis at home and look for support from peers, parents of friends, and teachers. Unless this outside support is detrimental, this distancing helps teens cope with the divorce, and most become re-involved with the family once the turmoil is ended. Teenagers should have some input regarding the visitation schedule. Flexibility is important to meet the needs of the teenagers' activities and that of the non-resident parent.
(5L) Checklist for Handling Children's Behavior Problems
Help children talk about their feelings, accept them and be understanding.
Help them to see why they are behaving as they are.
Distinguish between feelings (which are okay) and acting out feelings in destructive behavior (not okay).
Set clearly defined rules and limits for behavior.
Consistently enforce consequences if rules are broken (do not use physical punishment).
Teach children to remove themselves from the situation when losing control.
Help them find acceptable outlets for their anger.
End conflict with your spouse in your child's presence.
Be supportive; reassure children of your love, and work on building their self-esteem.
Realize that behavior problems are symptoms of children's pain and distress.
(5M) Should we stay together for the Kids?
The Facts!        •  Children from conflict-free single parent families are usually better adjusted than children from discordant intact families.        •  Children from conflict-ridden homes have more adjustment and behavior problems than do children from conflict-free homes.        •  Parental conflict is more damaging to children the longer it continues, the more it is openly hostile, and the more it focuses on the child.        •  Continued parental conflict is more damaging to children who have gone through parental divorce than for children who remain in their intact families.
CONFLICT MUST END WITH THE DIVORCE!!!
(5N) Grieving the Loss
The pain of divorce moves through a process that is very much like what happens to us when someone we love dies. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross did extensive work with terminal patients and studied how their feelings changed from the process of initial discovery to eventual death. These stages are useful in understanding how children grieve about the loss of the family as they imagined it. The grieving process is a progression of feelings and emotional states that move by stages. Grief is a normal way children deal with loss. These stages may vary in order; may be experienced simultaneously, or may be revisited after having progressed into the next stage. The grief process is painful, difficult, and inevitable, but the end result is healing, which will ultimately lead to growth.
The initial reaction to any traumatic event is shock; an inability or unwillingness to believe what is happening. After the initial shock, Kubler-Ross identifies five stage of coping with loss:
1. Denial - Denial is a common first response children experience because they need to believe that their parents will change their minds and the divorce is not going to happen. Mom or Dad will change their mind. Dad will come home next week.
2. Anger - Children experiencing anger want to blame someone for the sadness they feel. They are often irritable, aggressive and uncooperative. I hate Dad for leaving us. Mom should have cooked more and kept the house cleaner.
3. Bargaining - In this stage, children may feel their parents will stay together if they make a deal. The bargaining stage allows the child to feel they have some control over the situation, and they try to please. In bargaining, the child can focus on hope and delay facing sadness. If I do all my homework maybe Mom and Dad will call off the divorce.
4. Depression - Depression involves a great sense of loss and sadness children feel when they realize that nothing will stop the divorce. Parents need to allow their children to grieve the loss and express their sadness. When a parent rushes to encourage the child to focus only on the positive, it may be a reflection of the parent's inability to process sadness in themselves. I can't stop the divorce and can't fix the situation.
5. Acceptance - Acceptance is not characterized by happiness; it means moving beyond the feelings of loss. It begins when there is less depression, more resolution and stability, and the child accepts the divorce. Acceptance appears gradually and may take months or years to occur. Divorce is a major transition and a journey of growth. There are no absolute rules that determine how the process of healing will occur. Your children's ability to adapt to divorce is going to depend on your ability to adapt to the divorce. The sooner you begin to heal, the sooner your children will start on their road to recovery.

Chapter 6
Fostering your child's Long-term adjustment
(6A) How do I foster a positive and healthy relationship with my child/children ?
•  Like everything in life, both good and bad things can come out of a divorce. Your children's long-term adjustment will greatly depend on the support and security you provide for them. It is the divorcing process that can adversely impact families and particularly children. Our culture has perpetuated the myth that divorce and the resulting process is inherently bad or necessarily unhealthy, but this is not always the case.
•  Whenever possible, set aside time (each day if possible) where you can spend time with children individually. It does not have to be exceptionally long time; however, it should be consistent. It may be only for a few minutes but you will send a strong message to your children that they are a high priority.
•  Do not be afraid to show some emotion around your children. They need to see that their parents feel emotions and are not afraid of them. This will teach them to respect their feelings and not be afraid of expressing them as well. The key here is moderation. You do not want your child to feel overwhelmed by your emotions. Expressing emotions becomes a problem when you are consistently overtaken by your emotions and when they dominate most or all of your interactions with your children. At this point it is a good idea to reach out to your support system or to a qualified therapist. A byproduct of dealing with your emotions will be that your children will feel validated about their own difficult emotions. You should take advantage of validating and empathizing with your child's emotions. Let them know that sad, hurt, or angry feelings are OK. This will bring you closer together. Also, show children respect and have respect for their personal opinions and rights. There are, no doubt, issues that must be dealt with by the adults, but you can let your children know that they matter by explaining to them the reason and logic for certain decisions. This becomes more important for children who are older (10 and above). Children will not always agree with parent's choices, but remember, parents who are married make choices their kids do not agree with too. Avoid a situation where you feel like you have to run every decision by the kids and they must approve them. Even if they are uncomfortable with a choice a parent makes, it will be comforting to know that the adults are handling things for them.
•  Children should hear often that they are loved . They should feel that they are important to you now and always, no matter what the future holds. One way to show a child you love them is to support their interests and activities. Let them know that you admire their personal attributes and their interests by participating in extra curricular activities. In addition, show respect and concern for their friends. Let them know that if they are important to them they are important to you.
•  Make open communication a priority. Create an atmosphere where talking is encouraged (not forced) and safe. It is less important that agreement is reached when discussing certain issues and more important that everyone feel that their opinions count. Strive for understanding instead of agreement. This way kids will know that their thoughts and feelings are welcome. Fostering open communication can be a powerful way of bringing you closer to your children. To facilitate open communication you should first and foremost become a good listener. Listen not only to the words they are saying but also for the emotion or sentiment behind the words. Validate what your children say by asking questions that further your understanding of their thoughts and feelings. Try to avoid asking 'why' too often. Although asking 'why' is a question, it has a way of putting people on the defensive and feeling they have to justify themselves.
•  Avoid negative forms of communication like criticizing, lecturing, or interrogating. These all work to break down the lines of communication.
(6B) Is divorce ever the right thing to do ?
Divorce can be positive when it puts an end to the fighting children are exposed to, when it provides a healthy and safe environment for children, when it provides limits where none existed, when it stops unhealthy conduct between parents and instead allows them to function in more positive ways, and when it provides an escape from physical or emotional abuse. Divorce may be positive for one parent and devastating to the other, but the child may learn that two opposite points of view may both be true.
(6C) How do I explain the economic impact of the divorce to my children ?
It is a well-documented fact that most single parents experience a decline in their standard of living. While their income is reduced, their expenses decrease very little. Economic stability after divorce is found to be more important to well-being than is the level of income. When discussing your financial limitations with children, be careful not to overburden them with worry and anxiety. Children worry about whether their single parent will be able to take care of them, and may interpret a parent's words and anxiety to mean that they may not have a roof over their heads or roof on the table. If your financial situation is tight but not desperate, include your children in decisions about what can be cut and decide with them what is important to the family. If you allow yourself to feel cheated, resentful, and helpless, you will create additional unhappiness for yourself and your children. If you need someone to listen to your problems, seek out an adult, not your children.
(6D) What impact will moving have on my children ?
If it is not possible to limit the amount of change in your children's lives and a move is necessary, the need for social support will increase. It is important to understand the loss of community felt by children if they have to move, change schools, or give up social activities as a result of the divorce. Children need extra doses of time, support, and understanding during the period of upheaval after separation and divorce. Frequent contact with supportive adults outside the family (grandparents, teachers, parents of friends) can be an invaluable asset for children when they are in stressful circumstances. If possible, try to maintain contact with people who were supportive for both you and your children in the past. These supportive relationships can buffer children from some of the negative impact of the stress in their lives.
The loss of community can also be experienced by parents when family and friends take sides in the divorce, or when the parent has to relocate. Utilize and expand your social support system to help alleviate some of the stress associated with this transition.

(6F) What Helpful Qualities May A Child Acquire After A Positive Divorce Experience ?
1. Learn to deal with change - Children of divorced parents often learn to adapt to changing circumstances more quickly than other children. This often reinforces a sense of inner strength and resilience.
2. Learn to express feelings - Throughout the divorce process children often have to deal with a wide range of emotions. This can facilitate a recognition of different feelings and ways to express them that are healthy.
3. Greater sense of independence - Children of divorce often become more responsible for themselves and their siblings and at an earlier age.
4. More likely to seek help - Children of divorce may have a more realistic sense of their abilities and weaknesses and may be more willing to seek assistance when needed.
5. Openness to diversity - Children whose parents have divorced are often exposed to a wider range of diversity and lifestyles. This exposure can be beneficial in a variety of ways and contribute to long term adjustment in many of life's situations and circumstances.

Chapter 7
(7A) New Relationships &amp; Step Family Issues
Children of divorce must begin the process of letting go of the concept of the two parent family. Take the time to go slow when initiating a new relationship to give children time to deal with different lifestyles and the possibility of an extended family. Rushing into dating may be viewed by your child as competition for your love and attention. Old fears of abandonment may surface as the fantasy dissolves that the divorcing parents will unite. As a result of the divorce, some children lose trust in adults and are slow to accept a new adult into their life. It is important to talk to your children about their feelings and their role in the new step family. Communication, reassurance, and time will help your child make the needed adjustment.
(7B) How can I help my children understand that I need a social life ? Before dating, give your children enough time to adjust to the idea that mom and dad will be seeing other people. Make your activities with your date a part of a group function. Starting your social life with friends the children already know may also help them get the point that you are dating. In the beginning of a new relationship, meet your dates away from home to avoid having a number of different people in your home and your child's life. Your child had lived through difficult changes and should not be asked to adjust to something else this significant unless it is necessary. Choose with care whom you let get close to your family.
(7C) How do I introduce a new partner in my life to my child ?
It is important to go slowly. Before you introduce them, let your children know the nature of your relationship. Begin with a few short outings to take the pressure off forced conversation. If it looks as if the relationship will be long term, outings can gradually become longer. It is important to reassure your children of your love for them. They are less likely to accept someone they perceive as a threat to their relationship with you. It is crucial that they know that the person is not a replacement for their absent parent.
(7D) Will remarriage help to bring more stability in our lives ?
Remarrying before you get back on your feet is more likely to create new problems than to solve existing ones. No one can invest the energy needed to make a remarriage work if he or she is stuck on unresolved issues from the past. Unfortunately, some people spend more time in fighting with their former spouse than in building a life with their new partner. Before you consider remarriage, make sure you deal with your feelings of loss and anger. Letting go of your past relationship will help you to feel whole again so you can close the door on your marriage and get on with your life.
Remarriage is usually a time of crisis for children. It is important to talk to your children about their feelings. Most children struggle with feelings of loss. Now the parent's attention, time, and love must be shared all the time. The closer the parent-child relationship had been, the harder it usually is on the child and the more the step-parent is seen as an unwelcome intruder. Many children feel betrayed and believe they have been replaced.
Because many children never give up the fantasy of having their parents back together, remarriage awakens feelings of loss for children. Often, the hurt and anger the child feels is directed towards the new step parent. Once again, children are powerless to influence the events in their lives. Common problems surfacing in children at the time of remarriage are fighting, withdrawal, unhappiness, poor concentration, and substance abuse. Fortunately, children's problems are generally not long term.
(7E) Can the new spouse act as a replacement for the absent parent ?
A parent is a parent forever and cannot be replaced. A child usually remains loyal to a biological parent and will resist an intruder who tries to take the absent parent's place. It is natural for step-parents to feel competitive with their predecessors and may attempt to prove they are a better spouse and parent. Children usually see their behavior as an attempt to take over and do not like to see their biological parents on the losing end of a contest. Resentment may be the result due to the fierce loyalty to the natural parent. Some children become torn with guilt and loyalty conflicts between the step-parent and biological parent. The relationship between step-parent and step-children works best if the space formerly shared by the absent parent and child is protected rather than filled. A step-parent needs to develop new rituals and a unique role with a stepchild without moving in on the absent parent's turf.
(7F) How much authority with regard to discipline should a step-parent have ? It is important to define the role of the step-parent to avoid confusion in children about who is in charge of them and their actions. The parent, step-parent, and child need to communicate and agree on the boundaries and rights of the step-parent.
Step-parents and step-children need to build a relationship with each other before attempting any form of discipline. Allow the biological parent to handle discipline while the step-parent bonds with step-children. Most children worry that accepting the step-parent is being disloyal to the absent parent. Try not to interpret your step-children's resistance or behavior as negative. It is natural and to be expected for a while. When biological parents allow step-parents the role of disciplinarian, children often feel betrayed and are likely to be at odds with both step-parent and parent.
In the beginning, a step-parent may feel threatened by the co-parental relationship between biological parents. The step-parent should never be involved with an ex-spouse in an angry or abusive way. That would be detrimental to the trust children have in adult behavior. Any conflict should be settled between co-parents, not the step-parent.
(7G) Will the blending process be easier if the absent parent is less involved ?
Many couples feel that life would be simpler if their former spouse were not in the picture. Families attempt to freeze out a biological parent creating loyalty conflicts for their children. Studies indicate that children need both their parents and would suffer more when a parent is no longer a part of their lives. Step families usually work better when children are able to continue relationships with their outside parent. Children usually adjust to different households, lifestyles, values, and rules much easier than they can adjust to losing a parent.
When the relationship with the absent parent is protected, most children are better able to accept a stepparent. A stepparent can be someone in addition to a natural parent, not a replacement for that parent.
(7H) Will my child have difficulty adjusting to so many changes ?
Children generally adapt to change quite well; however, the more changes they experience, the more difficulty they have coping. Prioritize what things need to change. The most critical area in which to limit change is in the children's relationships with their natural parents. A good relationship with a parent provides children with a buffer from stress. Continue to spend some time alone with each of your children. Reassure your children that they can continue their relationships with their absent parent without threat of being disloyal to you.
Maintain consistency in rules and discipline and retain as many familiar everyday routines as you can. If possible, look for a way that children can remain in the same school for at least a year and continue to see their old friends.
(7I) How much should I question my children about their activities while they are with the non-resident parent ?
Your children are not informants and should not be questioned for information about activities or relationships of the other parent. Show an interest in the activities your children are willing to openly discuss with you without excessive questioning. Showing no interest in your children's activities while spending time with your ex-spouse sends the message that you do not approve of your children maintaining a close relationship with the other parent, which will lead to guilt and loyalty conflicts. Your opinions regarding your ex-spouse and their new mate should remain positive or neutral to allow your children to feel as if they are a part of both families. The time spent with either parent should be viewed by everyone as time that should be enjoyed. It is crucial for the children to feel that everyone is trying to love them.

Chapter 8
Dealing with ABUSE &amp; Domestic Violence
(8A) What is the legal definition of Domestic Violence ?
Domestic Violence is defined as any assault, battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in the physical injury or any death of one family household member by another, who is or was living in the same home or between any couple who has a child together even if they never lived together. Domestic Violence can take the form of psychological, emotional or sexual abuse. Domestic Violence is about one person in a relationship using a pattern of behaviors to control the other person. Victims of violence should understand that ignoring abuse will not make it stop. Abuse becomes more serious with time and victims must realize that an abusive relationship is unhealthy and unsafe.
(8B) What kind of behavior is considered domestic violence ?
Domestic violence can take a number of forms, including but not limited to:        •  physical behavior such as slapping, punching, pulling hair, kicking, choking or shoving        •  forced or coerced sexual acts or behavior such as unwanted fondling or intercourse, or jokes and insults aimed at sexuality, or accusations of sexual infidelity
What other behaviors may also accompany abusive situations?        •  throwing objects, punching walls or doors, tearing clothes        •  threats of abuse - threatening to hit, harm or use a weapon on you, your children, other family members or pets, or to tell others confidential information, stalking        •  psychological abuse - attacks on self-esteem, name calling or putdowns, controlling or limiting another's behavior, keeping a partner from contacting their family or friends, repeated insults and interrogation        •  withholding money, stopping a partner from getting or keeping a job, keeping or taking your paycheck, preventing him/her from leaving, unplugging the phone        •  threatening suicide to get you to do something, making him/her do illegal things        •  intimidation, including making him/her afraid by using looks, actions or gestures        •  actions which result in the fear of imminent danger are also considered spouse abuse
A victim of domestic violence may be either male or female. Children are also victims either physically, emotionally, or both.
(8C) What are some typical behaviors of an Abusive Personality ?
•  Jealousy of spouse's time spent with co-workers, friends, family, etc.        •  Controlling behavior        •  Breaking or throwing objects during anger        •  Using force during an argument        •  Verbal insults        •  Blames others for problems        •  Sudden mood swings        •  Tries to isolate spouse from family and friends        •  Makes threats of violence towards spouse
(8D) What are the effects of domestic violence on children ?
Children can have long lasting emotional effects resulting from living in a household where spousal abuse exists. Children often develop coping skills and strategies to intercede to protect the parent who is the victim of abuse. A parental victim may also develop strategies to redirect the abuser away from the children if the children are in danger, and as a result may be abused while trying to protect the children. Children who grow up in a household where a parent has been abused often imitate that abuse in relationships later in life.
Parents who know that their children have witnessed violence may contact their local school for counseling available through the school or other local agencies.
(8E) How Can the Law Protect Me ?
Victims should call 911 if an act of violence is occurring. The law can protect you if you are being abused or threatened by a family or household member, including a former spouse. The law also protects people from abuse from someone (whether married, related or not) who is or was living with you, or never lived with you but with whom you have a child in common. If you are a victim of Domestic Violence you should immediately call the police. Subsequently, you may call the State Attorney for your local county and ask to file a criminal complaint. A charge filed with the State Attorney's Office will be heard in a Criminal Court. If you have been abused or fear that the abuser is going to be violent to you, the law entitles you to get a Judge to order the abuse to end. You have the right to go to the Family Intake Unit and file a legal document called a Petition requesting an Injunction for Protection From Domestic Violence. This process takes approximately 3 hours to complete and will require that you bring a picture identification for yourself and of the abuser if possible. This is done in a civil court and may include provisions which restrain the abuser form further acts of abuse; direct the abuser to leave your household; prevent the abuser from entering your residence, school, business, or place of employment; prevent the abuser from stalking you; award you custody of the minor child or children; and direct the abuser to pay support to you and the minor children if the abuser has a legal obligation to do so. The court may also order the abuser to attend counseling.
The Legislature has waived all filing and service fees for cases meeting the criteria of 'Domestic' under State Statutes (State Statutes may vary, check with your county courts). After hours and holiday emergency Protection Orders are available. Contact your local police department for information on restraining orders on holidays, evenings, and after-hours.
There are various agencies which offer programs to treat batterers as well as Anger Management Programs. Check with your local courts for that information.
(8F) How do I Get the Courts to Help Protect Me ?
Once you have filed for the Injunction, the Judge may sign a Temporary Injunction which is issued the same day you file the petition asking for protection. The Temporary Injunction will remain in effect until the time of a court hearing, normally within 15 days of the day the temporary order is issued, and is given to you by the judge when you are in immediate danger of being hurt, or have been hurt. Notice of Hearing for a Permanent Injunction is given to you when you obtain the Temporary Injunction.
A Permanent Order is issued at the end of the hearing if you prove that abuse took place. The Judge may issue a Permanent Order which is good for up to one year and may be extended for a year at a time, indefinitely. In order to extend the Injunction, you must apply to the court at least one month prior to the expiration date of the Injunction in effect. A judge can also place a time limit on the order. If so, the petitioner would need to file a motion with the court several weeks prior to request a hearing for an extension. The State Attorney's office handles criminal proceedings and Family Court services handles restraining orders (check with your local courts for the court services that handle restraining orders). The State Attorney's office addresses criminal violations of a restraining order.
(8G) How does this Injunction Protect Me ?
The Judge may order any or all of the following things in the injunction:        •  The abuser is not to commit any acts of violence against you, your children, or others living with you.        •  The abuser may have to immediately leave the residence you share.        •  The abuser must stay away from your home, your place of employment and your children's school.        •  You have temporary custody and temporary child support for any children you and the abuser share together.        •  The abuser cannot stalk you.        •  The abuser may be ordered to attend counseling, domestic violence classes, alcohol/drug counseling and/or parenting classes.
(8H) How can I Get Help in an Emergency ?
Call 911 if you feel you are being threatened or feel that the restraining order is/has been violated!
If the respondent is in the area and has not been served yet, you may request that the police officer serve the respondent your copy of the Injunction (emergency packet). File a police report for every violation and get copies of the police report.

(8K) What are some of the statistics on domestic violence ?
According to the Commission on Domestic Violence of the American Bar Association:        •  Domestic violence crosses ethnic, racial, age, national origin, sexual orientation, religious and socioeconomic lines.
•  By the most conservative estimate, each year 1 million women suffer nonfatal violence by an intimate.Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Violence Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey (NCJ-154348), August 1995, p. 3.
•  By other estimates, 4 million American women experience a serious assault by an intimate partner during an average 12-month period.American Psychl. Ass'n, Violence and the Family: Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family (1996), p. 10.
•  28% of all annual violence against women is perpetrated by intimates.Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: National Crime Victimization Survey, Violence Against Women (NCJ-145325), January 1994.
•  5% of all annual violence against men is perpetrated by intimates.Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: National Crime Victimization Survey, Violence Against Women (NCJ-145325), January 1994.
•  Domestic violence is statistically consistent across racial and ethnic boundaries.Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Violence Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey (NCJ-154348), August 1995, p. 3.
•  Each year, an estimated 3.3 million children are exposed to violence by family members against their mothers or female caretakers.American Psychl. Ass'n, Violence and the Family: Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family (1996), p. 11.
•  In homes where partner abuse occurs, children are 1,500 times more likely to be abused.Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Family Violence: Interventions for the Justice System, 1993.
•  40-60% of men who abuse women also abuse children.American Psychl. Ass'n, Violence and the Family: Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family (1996), p. 80.
•  47% of men who beat their wives do so at least 3 times per year.AMA Diagnostic &amp; Treatment Guidelines on Domestic Violence, SEC: 94-677:3M:9/94 (1994).
(8L) What is the Definition of Child Abuse ?
Child abuse and neglect is, at a minimum:        •  Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation        •  An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm. The legal definition of a child is any person under the age of eighteen.
(8M) What Are the Main Types of Maltreatment ?
There are four major types of maltreatment: physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse. While State definitions may vary, operational definitions include the following:        •   Physical Abuse is characterized by the infliction of physical injury as a result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, burning, shaking or otherwise harming a child. The parent or caretaker may not have intended to hurt the child, rather the injury may have resulted from over-discipline or physical punishment. A child witnessing domestic violence is also considered child abuse.
•   Child Neglect is characterized by failure to provide for the child's basic needs. Neglect can be physical, educational, or emotional.
•   Physical Neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care, abandonment, expulsion from the home or refusal to allow a runaway to return home, and inadequate supervision. Educational neglect includes the allowance of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school age in school, and failure to attend to a special educational need. Emotional neglect includes such actions as marked inattention to the child=s needs for affection, refusal of or failure to provide needed psychological care, spouse abuse in the child's presence, and permission of drug or alcohol use by the child. The assessment of child neglect requires consideration of cultural values and standards of care as well as recognition that the failure to provide the necessities of life may be related to poverty. Sexual Abuse includes fondling a child's genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials. Many experts believe that sexual abuse is the most under-reported form of child maltreatment because of the secrecy or "conspiracy of silence" that so often characterizes these cases.
•   Emotional Abuse (psychological/verbal abuse/mental injury) includes acts or omissions by the parents or other caregivers that have caused, or could cause, serious behavioral, cognitive, emotional, or mental disorders. In some cases of emotional abuse, the acts of parents or other caregivers alone, without any harm evident in the child=s behavior or condition, are sufficient to warrant child protective services (CPS) intervention. For example, the parents/caregivers may use extreme or bizarre forms of punishment, such as confinement of a child in a dark closet. Less severe acts, such as habitual scapegoating, belittling, or rejecting treatment, are often difficult to prove and, therefore, CPS may not be able to intervene without evidence of harm to the child. Although any of the forms of child maltreatment may be found separately, they often occur in combination. Emotional abuse is almost always present when other forms are identified.
(8N) How can I recognize warning signs of child abuse ?
Experienced educators likely have seen all forms of child abuse at one time or another. They are alert to signs like these that may signal the presence of child abuse.
The Child :        •  Shows sudden changes in behavior or school performance;        •  Has not received help for physical or medical problems brought to the parents' attention;        •  Has learning problems that cannot be attributed to specific physical or psychological causes;        •  Is always watchful, as though preparing for something bad to happen;        •  Lacks adult supervision;        •  Is overly compliant, an over-achiever, or too responsible; -or-        •  Comes to school early, stays late, and does not want to go home.
The Parent :        •  Shows little concern for the child, rarely responding to the school's requests for information, for conferences, or for home visits;        •  Denies the existence of, or blames the child for the child's problems in school or at home;        •  Asks the classroom teacher to use harsh physical discipline if the child misbehaves;        •  Sees the child entirely bad, worthless, or burdensome;        •  Demands perfection or a level of physical or academic performance the child cannot achieve; -or-        •  Looks primarily to the child for care, attention, and satisfaction of emotional needs.
The Parent and Child :        •  Rarely touch or look at each other;        •  Consider their relationship entirely negative; -or-        •  State that they do not like each other.
None of these signs proves that child abuse is present in a family. Any of them may be found in any parent or child at one time or another. But when these signs appear repeatedly or in combination, they should cause the educator to take closer look at the situation and to consider the possibility of child abuse. That second look may reveal further signs of abuse or signs of a particular kind of child abuse.

(8R) Is there a Correlation between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse ?
According to published studies, there is a 30 percent to 60 percent overlap between violence against children and violence against women in the same families. While identification of, and response to, children who observe domestic violence is not yet well developed, evidence suggests that witnessing may be as harmful to children as suffering physical abuse (Margolin, 1998). One form of child abuse is witnessing domestic violence. Many people think that infants and young children are too young to process domestic violence. Studies suggest that young children can be overwhelmed by their exposure to violence, especially when both the victim and the perpetrator are well known and emotionally important to the child (Osofsky, 1996). Children from violent homes exhibit both more aggressive and delinquent behavior and more withdrawn, anxious behaviors in comparison to children from non-violent homes. Additionally, they perform significantly below their peers in such areas as school performance, organized sports, and social activities (Kolbo, 1996).
(8S) According to the Law, Who Must Report Child Abuse ?
The law mandates the reporting of child abuse by any physician, medical examiner, nurse and hospital personnel engaged in the admission, examination, care or treatment of the child. Health or mental health professionals including practitioners who rely on spiritual healing must also report child abuse. School teachers or other school officials, social workers, day care providers and any other child care giver, foster care, residential caretaker or institutional worker and all law enforcement officers must report child abuse. Failure to report child abuse could result in the loss of a professional's license to practice. Also mandated to report child abuse is anyone over the age of 18 who is living in the home and who is aware of, or has witnessed, the abuse of a child. Except for certain protections allowable by law, this person's failure to report child abuse is a Felony in the Third Degree. Child abuse must be reported to the Department of Children and Families by calling 1-800-96-ABUSE (1-800-962-2873). Acts that harm a child's health or welfare which inflict or allow to inflict physical, mental, or emotional injury should be reported.
In homes where domestic violence exists, children often become another target of the abuses and/or become abusive parents later in life. They often act out aggressively in school. Any child who has witnessed domestic violence against a parent is a victim of child abuse. This abuse must be reported to the Department of Children and Families. (1-800-96-ABUSE).
(8T) Are there Penalties for Filing a False Child Abuse Report ?
False reporting of abuse or neglect for malicious reasons such as acquiring custody of the child, harassing, embarrassing or harming another person or personal or financial gain for the reporting person can result in perjury, fine or a suit for compensation by any investigating agency or all three. A false report does not include a report of child abuse if the report is made in good faith.
