Helping Parents Rise to the Challenge
The holidays can be a time of great joy, but they can also be a time when parents feel overwhelmed. This month we focus on ways to help parents rise to the challenge of parenthood. Here are just a few of the many Extension resources offered through CYFERnet to help parents deal with:
Secrets of Parenting: Reducing Whining and Improving Youth Children's Self-control (pdf) Young children under the age of 6 are very self-centered and think that they should get what they want and need "right now". They often get frustrated when they realize that the world does not revolve around them. This frustration can lead to whining and tantrums because they have not developed the self-control to deal with their frustrations. This fact sheet offers suggestions on how parents can deal with and avoid tantrums and whining.
What's a Parent to Do? This site links to Iowa State University's satellite and web cast seminar to be held December 7, 2-3 p.m. CST. If you are a professional or volunteer who works with families, or a caregiver of a child who has behavior problems or has experienced bullying, this may be the most important event you attend this year. This program is aimed at helping educators understand the emotional strengths in children and youth, and providing practical ideas to reframe how to work effectively with children and families.
Bullies (pdf) This fact sheet explains why children are bullies and how parents can help prevent their children from becoming bullies. It also provides ways to deal with a bully, as well as ways to detect whether a child may be being bullied.

It includes sections on different forms of bullying, strategies for teachers and schools, references, classroom activities, and children's books related to bullying.
Bullying: What Parents Can Do About It (pdf) This eight page publication offers advice to parents on what they can do about bullying. It includes sections on addressing bullying, strategies for parents, references, other resources, and children's books related to bullying.
Guidelines for Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs: Promoting Healthy Weight in Children These guidelines for obesity prevention programs encourage a health-centered, rather than weight-centered approach that focuses on the whole child - physically, mentally and socially.
