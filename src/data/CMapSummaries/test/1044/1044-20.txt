Obesity in Children: A National Epidemic
March 3, 2007
Dr. Sylvia Gearing, CBS 11 News
This week, international attention was drawn to British debate over whether to remove an eight-year-old obese child from his mother's custody. The case caused a debate about what causes childhood obesity, who is responsible for the child's welfare and what parents can do to fight this epidemic problem. Here to tell us more is CBS 11 News Contributor in Psychology, Dr. Sylvia Gearing.
Q: We have heard about the problems with obesity in childhood. How big a problem are we facing?
Dr. Sylvia: A recent Institute of Medicine report says that up to 25% of American children, including kids and adolescents, are obese. This is a grave disorder, since the physical and psychological consequences can be profound. More than 50% of adults are obese and this figure represents a 30% increase within a ten-year period. Our children are reflecting our eating habits and are suffering.
Q: What are the health consequences for obese children?
Dr. Sylvia:
Now and Tomorrow: One of the most serious health consequences of childhood obesity is the increased likelihood of the child developing adult obesity. One study found that obese children over the age of 6 had a 50% higher risk of adult obesity. Those odds jump to almost 80% if the parent is obese.
Diabetes: Obese children are more than twice as likely to have diabetes when compared to normal weight kids. Juvenile diabetes is a challenging illness.
Hardening of the Arteries: By their teens, they may have hardening of the arteries, an early warning sign of heart disease. German researchers found that their blood vessels are hardening on the outside and thickening on the inside.
Assorted Ills with Time: An array of other afflictions will appear over time including hypertension, respiratory disease, and orthopedic disorders.
Q: What about the psychological consequences?
Dr. Sylvia: Obesity in childhood can kill self-esteem, peer relationships, and most of all, hope. The taunting and teasing of an obese child are devastating. Subsequent disturbances in eating tend to intensify as the child becomes increasingly depressed, inactive and withdrawn. One study found that obese kids were 5.5 times more likely to have an impaired quality of life. Their scores on life satisfaction were more similar to those of cancer patients. This cycle tends to deepen as the child enters puberty and the pressure to be attractive increases. They simply cannot compete and they disappear into food to soothe their anxiety.
Q: Why is this phenomenon occurring now in America?
Dr. Sylvia: There appear to be a variety of factors that all contribute to this epidemic problem.
Inactivity: The sedentary nature of our children due to video games, TV, and the lack of after school neighborhood play are prominent contributors. Some schools don't even have recess anymore and many children don't have parents who can afford select soccer.
Exhausted Parents: The parents' long work hours and the exhaustion they feel at mealtime can contribute. Many of us are so burned out that we long for a restful family meal. Instructing your child not to have a second helping can be difficult when you are tired. You may be struggling with your own overeating issues.
Striking a Balance: The reluctance of parents to impose appropriate limits on snacking and overeating is another contributing issue. It is difficult to strike a balance between setting limits and not over-controlling your child's eating.
Q: So parents are responsible for their overweight kids?
Dr. Sylvia: Not at all! Blaming the parents overlooks a lot of other factors. A child's obesity originates in many complex factors including genetics, the advertising industries that court them, the addictive allure of overeating, their peer relationships, medical conditions, and their difficulty in emotionally regulating themselves (food becomes soothing). For example, if a child is a chronic asthmatic, he will be less likely to engage in exercise that exacerbates his asthma. As a result, he will gain weight over the years without parents understanding why.
Q: What are some recommendations for worried parents?
Dr. Sylvia: Remember that it is never too late to help your child. The ill effects of childhood obesity can be mitigated with enough determination and commitment. Your child can have a normal life and excellent health.
Positive Eating Messages: Encourage positive attitudes toward your child's new self-image. Do not shame or embarrass him, but focus on the new body you can build together. Introduce healthy foods that are lower in calories but filling, and encourage him to drink a ton of water! Teach your children what is good to eat--vegetables and fruit--and how to stay away from foods that will pack on the weight.
New Self-Soothing Techniques: For many kids, food is an escape from anxiety and stress. Emotionally coach your child to deal with his negative emotions by talking them out. Remind him that setbacks are temporary and that he can cope with whatever he is facing. Overeating no longer has to be a coping mechanism when you are more emotionally resilient.
Distract From Hunger: Begin to spend time with your child to develop new coping skills that will distract him from his hunger. For example, before dinner, go out for a brisk 20- to 30-minute walk. It is a great appetite suppressant and will increase his endorphins.
Join your child in this new adventure of change. You will be bonded for a lifetime!
