Nov 14th = World Diabetes Day AND Childrens Day - Coincidence?
It could be pure coincidence or it could be a perfect example of eerie foreshadowing that World Diabetes Day coincides with Childrens Day in India. It was in 2006 that researchers declared, for the first time, that India would soon become the diabetes capital of the world. Earlier this year , studies released showed some startling numbers to do with childhood obesity in India and in Delhi in particular. According to the studies, 20% of urban, middle and upper class school kids in India are overweight or obese. In Delhi, 25% of school children from middle and upper classes are obese or overweight. Data suggests that there are 15 million overweight children in urban India and 4 million obese children. Despite all the information available, parents are allowing their children to grow into obese adults.
Poor Habits That Lead to Childhood Obesity
These were the findings from the study that found 1 in 5 school children to be overweight or obese:
62% of school children have no fixed meal and snack times
43% do not eats fruits and vegetables every day
32% consume junk food as a major meal at least 3 times a week
31% drink less than 2 cups of milk a day
37% eat sweets and desserts every day
Dangers of Childhood Obesity:
Simply put, obese children grow up into obese adults increasing their likelihood of:
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Early heart disease
Bone problems
There are several beliefs that continue to contribute to the rise of childhood obesity. Beliefs that being overweight is a sign of economic prosperity, that an active, outdoor, childhood is not encouraged because it is not as "important" as an academic childhood and the concept that children will "shed the weight as they grow up" continue to contribute to childhood obesity cases. The myth of "puppy fat" has been disproved through several studies in the last decade and the challenge of losing childhood fat as adults as been documented several times over.
WebMD believes that the responsibility for the cause and the treatment of childhood obesity lies with the parents. Parents must be able to identify warning signs and support their children as they look to adopt and live healthier lives. Interestingly though, according to medical journal, Indian Pediatrics , medical professionals need a different set of skills to deal with childhood obesity and current learnings would not be enough to deal with what could be a challenging and combative situation. But the onus though, will continue to lie with the parents who would, hopefully, start looking at World Diabetes Day and Childrens Day as not just concidental.
