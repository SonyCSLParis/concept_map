Children who are given an "active" video game-one that requires that they move their body to play-are not likely to be more active in general than children who do not play active video games, a new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found.
The study followed 9- to 12-year-old children who do not have any obesity issues or other health concerns that would prevent them from having normally active lifestyles. Over the course of 13 weeks, researchers tracked the activity of the children, who were given either an active or an inactive video game, to see whether the active games inspired more everyday physical activity.
Though the active games are inherently physical and movement-oriented, the results, the researchers concluded, "provide no reason to believe that simply acquiring an active video game under naturalistic circumstances provides a public health benefit to children."
1. Implanon implant may not work as effectively. [Dr. Melissa] Gilliam, [board president of the Society of Family Planning], conducted a small study measuring how well Implanon - a three-year implant inserted beneath the skin of the arm - works in obese women; she found that blood levels of etonogestrel, released by the implant to prevent ovulation, were markedly lower in obese women compared to women who weren't overweight.
"We don't want to say this reflects clinical efficacy since the hormone levels were still high enough to prevent ovulation," said Gilliam. "But this is the first study to look at Implanon in obese women and it gives us some indication that it behaves differently. We need more information on this from larger studies."
2. Later hormone peak for pill. Other researchers examined the more commonly used oral contraceptives and found that obese women who take the pill, on average, don't reach a prime hormone level for preventing ovulation until day 10 of their pill pack, compared to women at a healthy weight who reach this hormone level by day 5. Whether this increases an obese woman's chances of becoming pregnant isn't known, said Dr. Alison Edelman, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health &amp; Science University who led the study.
"Some studies do show a slight reduction in contraceptive effectiveness among obese women," Edelman said. "But it's a little too early to say that they need to use a different method of birth control." Obese women may, though, want to speak to their doctors about the research findings to see whether they should take a birth control pill continuously or whether they should switch to an implant or intrauterine device to avoid having the dip in hormone levels.
3. Avoiding weight gain from Depo Provera shot. Overweight women, in particular, are looking for a contraceptive method that won't cause weight gain. And Depo Provera - a hormone shot given once every three months - has been known to cause significant weight gain in 1 in 4 women. The trouble is doctors don't know how to predict which women will gain those 10 pounds or more.
Whole milk and white bread are among the casualties of a set of school lunch changes the USDA announced this week.  The infusion of $3.2 billion of federal funding for the National School Lunch Program intends to offer children lunches higher in whole grain, vegetables, and fruits, and lower in fat and sodium.  The lunches will also monitor portion sizes in a way that leaders hope will help curb the childhood obesity epidemic that affects an estimated 17 percent of American children and teens.  Each lunch will cost a projected 6 cents more than current school lunches.
The changes are meant to appeal to kids' palates as well as being good for their bodies. According to the projected new menu, oven-baked fish nuggets will replace breaded beef patties; whole wheat spaghetti with meat sauce will replace hot dogs; and bean and cheese burritos will be replaced with turkey submarine sandwiches. Pizza day, a sacred school institution, will survive, but the cheese pizzas will be served on whole wheat crust, accompanied with baked sweet potato fries rather than the tater tots of yore.
The new regulations are the first changes to national school lunch policy in 15 years, the result of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The changes will begin to be phased in next fall, and will be fully implemented over 3-5 years.
Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the Maryland-based School Nutrition Association, told MSNBC.com she applauds the changes, but encourages parents to participate in the process of encouraging their kids to make healthier food choices. "We all have to work to get the kids to make these healthier choices," she said. "Students are more apt to pick up a fruit or vegetable in the lunch line if they have been introduced to those foods at home."
A study published this month in the journal Sociology of Education has found that banning the sale of salty and sweet junk foods in schools has no correlation to decreased rates of childhood obesity.  The New York Times reports:
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University tracked the body mass indexes of 19,450 students from fifth through eighth grade. In fifth grade, 59 percent of the children attended a school where candy, snacks or sugar-sweetened beverages were sold. By eighth grade, 86 percent did so.
The researchers compared children's weight in schools where junk food was sold and in schools where it was banned. The scientists also evaluated eighth graders who moved into schools that sold junk food with those who did not, and children who never attended a school that sold snacks with those who did. And they compared children who always attended schools with snacks with those who moved out of such schools.
No matter how the researchers looked at the data, they could find no correlation at all between obesity and attending a school where sweets and salty snacks were available.
"Food preferences are established early in life," said Jennifer Van Hook, the lead author and a professor of sociology and demography at Penn State. "This problem of childhood obesity cannot be placed solely in the hands of schools."
The new health care law requires that insurance companies screen for and offer prevention measures against the obesity epidemic that affects an estimated one in three U.S. children.  But implementing the law with programs that are proven successful is difficult, health care providers are saying.
Other than intensive hospital-based programs, few proven models exist for helping children and adolescents achieve and maintain a healthier weight, and researchers do not even fully understand the factors that contributed to the rapid rise in childhood obesity in recent years. "If this were easy, if there were clear outcomes for success, we would be investing in these," said Dr. Samuel R. Nussbaum, the chief medical officer for WellPoint, one of the nation's largest health insurers.
While there are many community efforts aimed at getting every child to eat better and exercise more, including Michelle Obama's "Let's Move" initiative, there is also growing demand for programs that help children who are already seriously overweight. WellPoint and the UnitedHealth Group, another large insurer, are experimenting with new approaches, and even Weight Watchers says it is working to develop a program for children and teenagers. Drug companies and medical device makers are also testing some products on children.
Adults have a difficult enough time losing weight, and the issues are even more complicated with children and teenagers, experts say. Children are still growing, and the goal of any program may be to help them grow into a healthier weight rather than to actually lose pounds. Experts also say that to be successful, programs need to focus on the family as a whole, changing what everybody eats and how much time they are all active, not sitting in front of a computer screen or television.
