Overweight children
Are we just so used to seeing bigger children (and adults to be honest) these days that we now think "chubby" is the new normal? I am NOT talking about children with health issues or legitimate issues that cause weight gain. I'm surprised at how much larger children seem to be and in the hospital I work at, childhood obesity, starting in toddlerhood is an epidemic. I'm saddened by parents who don't honestly understand why being heavy is a concern and that being in the 90th percentile doesn't mean the child is 90 percent of the weight they should be but heavier than 90 kids of that age and height and lighter than 10. What gets me more, are parents of children well over 100percentile who excuse their toddlers weight. They use the same excuses adults do. Words like chubby, thick, stocky, muscular, are thrown about when these kids can barely breathe, can't play with their peers and are obviously fat. There I said it. Now it's not about weight or looks, although children get teased horribly and that makes me sad too. It's about health. A persons permanent fat cells are created in the first 5 years of life. These cells can shrink and expand but NEVER go away! It's important to not let fat get out of hand. Parents assume kids will outgrow it or slim down but many don't. The diets of kids are atrocious. Pop, candy, chips, chicken nuggets, McDonalds, pizza, fries, ice cream, etc., The main excuses are "but she likes it" or "he won't eat anything else and he needs to eat." parents overfeed their children thinking they're not getting enough. Now this is where my post comes from and what tipped me over the edge today. A mom comes in with her son at 1pm. He's very large and in a stroller and I notice her in the waiting area. She takes out a Tupperware container and offers him chocolate cake. He doesn't want it and moves his face side to side to get away from her hand that is trying to shove cake into his mouth. I walk over and sit beside her to observe. She has no idea she's there to see me yet. Anyways, he's grunting and swatting his hands. I estimate him to be 5 years old by his size but his mannerisms and verbal ability lead me to think he's delayed. So I ask mom how old he is. 17 months! I'm not joking. I say, "imthink he's not hungry" and try to keep it light. She answers, "He has to eat, I don't want him to be hungry, it's my job to feed him." I note the time and ask, "Did he eat lunch, it's 1 o'clock?" "Yes he ate in the cafeteria at noon but this is a snack" "a snack, he just ate lunch. I don't think it's good to force him." She turns to me and says, "Now you sound like our doctor and he's crazy. I'm the mom and it's my job to feed my son. I don't want heim to be hungry and even if he says no, I know he needs to eat so he will have to eat." I was flabbergasted. I introduced myself, we went into my office and talked. During our session, I came to realize mom is in major denial and there's not much I can do until she realizes she's killing her son. He already has issues with not bearing weight on his legs due to weight and not wantng to walk or crawl because he's heavy. He wants to be pushed in his stroller or will lay on the couch or floor to play. He has no thyroid issues or reasons for weight gain other than overfeeding. His pediatrician referred his family to me. Now this is an extreme case but I do think that overall, our children are getting heavier. I see many chunky toddlers daily. Moms say toddlers are supposed to be chubby and I womder why they think that? Yes, some babies and toddlers can be a little rounder but thin out as they get older. Moms worry if toddlers drop in percentages but if your child was 75% and drops to 65%, they're still larger than average and there supposed to thin out. Eventually their weight plateaus and that's normal. I read about moms thinking 40 lb 2 year olds are normal, and really, it's not. It may be their normal or genetic but for the average child, it's not. Chunky kids are said to be "just fine" but if an adult was that size, they'd be told to lose a few by honest friends or their doctor. It's a fact that overweight children become overweight teens and adults. It's not fun to be the "fat" kid or an adult struggling with your weight. Children don't just feed themselves or pay for their own junk food. As parents, I think it's our jobs to teach healthy eatng by example. Just how parents who smoke have kids that smoke, parents who eat badly, have kids that do. Parents don't want to change their own eating habits or think it's no big deal. Others are afraid to say no to their kids. However, when a mom tells me her kid demands pop, I ask, how does he even know what it is and if he likes it? There's more and more children with type 2 diabetes and heart and lung problems. Our society is a more sedentary one which is huge contributing factor. Our kids don't play outside as much or participate in active pursuits. That's just facts. Some do, but many don't. I have a friend who's a single mom. She has always felt guilt about that so overcompensates with her daughter. She does it with food. Every time her DD was upset, well you know what'll fix that? Candy or chips. She shared everything she was having with her DD from an early age be it ice cappuccinos, to pop, to fast food, etc., Her DD was eating adult portions by 18 months I'd say. I know at 2 she ate the same as me. She could pack away 2 eggs, toast, hashvrowns and sausage for breakfast. That's an adult meal. I kept telling her mom, her DDs small and her needs are smaller. Her portions should be the size of her DDs palm and meats the size of her DDs fist, not an adults. She refused to listen. Her DD would eat a meal then eat another full meal right after. For example, they were at my house last year, her DD was 5. I had made a roast chicken dinner, biscuits, veggies, mashed potatoes. We all ate and her DD had 2 servings and they were the same size as all the adults. She complained she wanted more but I said no. I know, not my child but she weighs 140 lb! That cute chubby toddler is obese and weighs more than me. Her mom buys her plus size woman's clothing in petite section because she's short. Anyways, she had a fit but her mom whispered to her and she calmed down. After they left, I realized my friend had forgotten something so I called her cell. They were at McDonalds! Her DD was eating another meal. That's what her mom whispered. I no longer say anything about it but het cousin is a closer friend of mine. She wants to call CAS and feels that's abuse. She says just like malnourishing and starving a child is abuse, so is morbid obesity. I'm not cool with that but do agree changes need to happen. I look around though and just notice that children are just big these days. Round double chin faces, rolly Polly bodies wth big belies, thighs and butts are ok. Moms push milk and food constantly and I think it's because a normal child looks small because so many children are big. Now I know kids come in different shapes and sizes. I know you're not supposed to put toddlers on a diet. I know weight isn't everything, nor looks. I know there could be other issues. So please don't attack without really getting what I'm saying. I think that just like moms are concerned that kids are too small, they should be realistic about their child being too big or big enough. Maybe I just cant get the poor little boy out of my head. Anyone else notice a lot of kids are overweight these days? Is it the epidemic pediatricians say? Is it abusive to overfeed or feed your child garbage foods?

I totally agree. My nephew (sil's kid) is 7 months and 21 pounds, that is as much as my 18month old (who is sick and losing weight from his illness)!
I feel horrible for all the babies/toddlers/children who are overweight and allowed to be that way.
As a parent it is my job to feed my children but its my job to feed my children HEALTHY food, not fast foods, frozen foods, boxed foods.. So many people think that home cooked foods take too long or are difficult to make but they aren't and they surly are more healthier than the crap I see so many kids eating.
My diet isn't the best but I make it my job to feed my kids the right foods until they are old enough to buy their own or make something themselves.
Also I should add clothing sizes haven't changed in a very long time.. You know there is an issue with weight in infants/toddlers/children when they are say 4 months old and wearing 18 month cloths! <- I'm sorry but your kid isn't 'just big' he's overweight unless he's so tall 18m clothes are all that fits.
I do have a hard time blaming the parents sometimes because of the nature of the country. America is so BIG on food being quick, easy, plentaful! Anything worth having isn't quick, easy, or plentaful (imo).
These parents that are overfeeding their kids are not doing them any favors. When they get to school, they are usually ridiculed by other students, sometimes causing poor self esteem, in turn some eat for comfort, making the situation worse. Or some go completely the opposit way and become anorexic. I'm not saying it happens to every single overweight kid, but it happens often.
I do agree with you on some parts. My cousin was a very chubby baby/toddler/child. She was always in the top % for weight. My Aunt made most of their food from scratch and it was healthy. Now at 12 she has finally grown into herself. I would never call her fat- but she was chunky.
My DD is probably going to be like my cousin. She was born 3 weeks early at 5lbs 14ozs. 2mths she was 12lbs, 4mths she was around 16lbs. She didn't even start solids/cereal until she was 8mths all she had before that was breastmilk. Now at 15mths she is almost 23lbs. My girl can eat. I make sure what she eats is good, but I'm not going to restrict food for a 15mth old.
As for the clothing reference- depends on what brand you buy. My DD is able to fit in some 9-12mths and all the way up to a 2T (granted I do use cloth diapers which add some extra padding).
The case that you are talking about with the boy- that might be considered abusive. Trying to force feed a child is horrible, and then trying to do it with cake is worse. I think everything in moderation. Some kids will be bigger than others, some will be toothpicks.
The kids that you see on the Maury type of shows is abusive to me. Weighing over 100+lbs before you are 5 without some type of medical condition. Kids that are chubby- should not be on a diet.

My DD was a preemie too. She weighs 22 lb now at 2 and a half. I know she's too small. For your DD, do you restrict the types of foods she eats. For example, not serving more carbs if she wants more but offering fruit or veggies? I don't think it's necessary to stop a child from eating but I do think that if they've eaten a reasonable portion of carbs, protein, fats and dairy (moms think milk is separate but it's a whole food), then instead of giving more bread, more meat, more yogurt, more milk, another granola bar, etc., wouldn't it be better to give fruit or veg? That way they're still eating but not unnecessarily. I'm talking about if a childs already had a meal or snacks and isn't satisfied, not only giving fruits or veg for all snacks. Now when moms say they don't want to restrict food, I have a series question- do your kids ask for more once done a serving, do you offer more automatically, do you think youv given larger portions from the start and they're used to eating that much, do you know what the right sized portions for your child are, when do you stop, how do you know they're actually hungry? I'm not asking these to be argumentative but because I'd honestly like to know. My DD never asks for more. I offer more but she freaks out. I wonder if I did something wrong when starting solids and table foods. Our dietician gave us hand outs on portions and I was surprised at how little they're supposed to have and how much most kids I know eat in comparison. I think moms just aren't aware.
I'm kinda curious. Are you a dietitian? I'm guessing this because you mentioned the child's doctor sent them to you. There was a dietitian at the hospital I used to work at, that was morbidly obese. I'm sure the patients thought it was a joke when we sent them to her.
No, therapist. I'm not obese either. I think that moms get upset because I am thin an they think I think I'm perfect or something? I'm far from it but I do feel judged myself. I work on a team at a Children's Hospital and a dietician, pediatrician, OT, NP, social worker and others are on the team. We don't just deal with obesity but lots of health and family issues.
Sounds like the mom has some kind of eating disorder/food issue. What is the doctor(or you?) doing to help her? If you saw her forcing her over weight toddler to eat, did you report it? It's obvious the mom needs help with this issue.
I don't think you should restrict healthy food from a toddler. If you offer them a healthy well balanced and allow them to control the amount of food they eat, they will be fine. And, with that I wouldn't worry at all about them over eating. Some days they might pig out and some days they may barely eat, that is fine too. They are growing! They need fat for their growing brain. I think this issue goes two ways - some parents are too worried about having a fat child that they aren't feeding them enough or they are too restrictive on things that toddlers need to grow. They need more than fruits and veggies.
It can be perfectly healthy for a baby that is EBF or EFF(with the recommended ounces) to be fat or chunkjy. You'd be fat too if you didn't walk and had someone carrying you around all day. I think those healthy chunky monkey's slim down when they starting crawling and walking.
