A new study found that obese mothers were ten times more likely to have obese daughters and obese fathers were six times more likely to have obese sons. However, children of the opposite gender of obese parents were unaffected, leading researches to conclude that childhood obesity may be the result of learned behavior.
Plymouth's Peninsula Medical School conducted the study on 226 families over three years. The researchers found that 41&amp;#37; of the eight-year-old daughters with obese mothers were also obese, whereas only 4% of the daughters with normal-weight mothers were obese. There was no difference in the boys with obese mothers.
Similarly, 18% of the eight-year-old boys with obese fathers were also obese, whereas only 3% of the boys with normal-weight fathers were obese. Once again, there was no difference in the girls with an obese father.
The researchers do not think that genetics play a role in their findings because it is uncommon for genetics to run down gender lines. Rather, they think it is some form of "behavior sympathy" in which daughters copy the lifestyle of their mothers and sons copy the lifestyle of their fathers.
Let's see if this research holds true of the OD community by responding to the poll (see above)...
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
All I can say is my father was always thin and my mother wasn't and I am a male and over weight so... I do believe there are, in some cases a parental connection but I would think it would have more to do with which parent you spent more time with that would most influential on your eating habits and weight. My father was in the military and not around much and I was mostly raised by my mother.
However I am not looking to point fingers or place blame I knew better in High school and I was still heavy until my mother decide to go to a nutritionist and asked me if I wanted to go as well, and I did and I lost weight. I did not keep it off however and at that point and at that age I do take full responsibility for that and I am not blaming either of my parents for my weight.
I think studies are a great thing but the results may vary greatly depending on the group you are studying based on location, foods and culture.

Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
I would agree with SentinelBasch that I learned how to overeat and reward myself with food treats as a kid, but I'm sure my parents did their best and they're good people. I wouldn't blame them for any of my problems since they didn't screw me up intentionally!
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
growing up we always had to finish what was on our plates full or not , if i did it was " good girl" than i got dessert if not no dessert for me. if only we were taught to stop eating when we were full maybe most of us would still be in tune with our bodies and listen when it sends the full signal. So i have a different approach with my kids whom are 10 and 7 , when your full scrap your plate !!!! both my kids are slim and average weight were i was already chubby at there ages
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
Oh yeah, the dreaded "Clean Plate Club". When I was growing up, it was absolutely expected, and I'm still a member of that club. Sometimes, it KILLS me to see food get thrown away, even just a crumb of bread. It's an obsessive mentality.
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
Good approach, Mandie!
Anyone else have this problem: nothing could go to waste, so if there weren't enough leftovers for another meal, they'd be shopped around to everyone at the table until they were reluctantly taken and eaten by SOMEBODY?
My opinion now is that I'd rather let it go to WASTE than to my WAIST.

Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
Hmm I guess I am another one that doesn't fit in this study. My mother was on the smaller side and my father on the larger. (I am female). My Father's mom was also obese so I guess we are a whole family that doesn't fit the study lol.
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
My father, tall and thin. My mother, short and rounded. Me, the Amazon of the womenfolk in the nuclear and extended family. Bigger, taller, stronger, faster, louder than 'em all. Don't know where I get it from. I do come from a long line of dead people.

Repeat after me: "My body is not a garbage can."
OH MY WORD did I have that problem. I used to get chastised for not finishing my meal, and told how people in Ethiopia were starving and here I was wasting food and $$$$.
What parents don't realize is that by doing this, they're setting their kids up for failure later on in life.
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
I still do find it painful to waste food! I have finally learned that it's better to throw something away than overeat but it drives me crazy when something yummy like my veggie and cheese lasagna has to get thrown away! Last time that happened because for several days I just didn't have 900 calories to spend on dinner! And then it was all dried out and icky. We tend to not overbuy anymore but still sometimes have to throw away stale bread now that I'm counting calories since bread is so full of calories. And although I love our CSA farm they give us like 15 pounds of produce every Thursday and we don't always get through it all before it goes bad. Last night to try and use up a lot of produce while it was still good, I made dinner out of a full bunch each of chard and kale, plus a fresh ancho chili, sauteed and then mixed with 2 cans of chili with beans. We each had about a third of the batch, topped with 1.5 oz shredded cheddar and a whole chopped tomato, plus a slice of local artisan bread full of whole cloves of garlic on the side. VERY filling and under 850 calories even with the bread. Without the bread or cheese it would have been low calorie. There's a bowl of it in the fridge and I know we should have that many veggies every day, but we don't! I am going to try and serve dinners to my kids that have a protein, a carb, and 2 veggies. We usually just had one veggie when I was growing up. On the other hand, I think my kids might be genetically predisposed to be chubby because a chubby phase in childhood seems to have happened to several relatives in my family and in my husband's family even though they all had different eating habits. So I'll just try and foster self-esteem and see if they like any athletic activities. I don't think parenting is completely in control of how a kid turns out.

At some point, my standard response to that comment became, "Fine. You grab a box, and I'll call Fedex."
Yeah, I used to have problems throwing food away, but then I realized the alternative -- putting the leftovers into a plastic container, letting it clutter my refrigerator for a week or two until it started to sprout, and THEN throwing it out.
Why bother dirtying the plastic container like that? And why would you want to deal with the smell of rotting food? I figure it's easier to cut out the middleman and just toss it if I don't have firm plans to eat the leftovers in the very near future.
(Obviously determining whether something "will be eaten" will be harder for someone with a family, but it's a much simpler calculus for a single guy like me. My cat just doesn't like my leftovers.)
I'm not one to waste food, so I'll typically estimate portions conservatively to minimize leftovers. Besides, it's more fun to leave guests wanting more -- makes it more likely that we'll be ready for dessert after an hour or so of playing DDR.
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
its not always the case monigue , but lets face it, if you feed kids garbage ,high cal food or portions that are way to much they have WAY higher of a chance to be obease which than give a higher chance to be obease adults. although you are right parenting is not the only factor, but as a parent i am the biggest part of my childrens life and i am in control of what my childrens eating habits are

This is very true and I see this in my own kids. I hate to say it but if they are with my wife or myself or my wife's mother they eat much better, act much better and have fewer problems but when thy stay with my mother they eat much worse and have problems with rashes, constipation and mood problems. And my youngest was having a weight issue until we discovered her red dye allergy and it was then my mother stopped taking her to Dunkin donuts regularly and feeding her other junk. Now we are in a battle over fried foods like McDonalds French fries.

Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
I agree Mandie and Justme, parents have a big impact on how their kids eat. I just think it's not fair to say that kids become obese BECAUSE of their obese parents. They see that as one way to eat but hopefully they also learn about nutrition and health at school. They might learn bad habits when they're too young to know better, but eventually we all have the ability to learn how to eat healthy.
What I mean is that I don't think we should blame parents for unintentionally passing on bad habits. They're doing the best they know how, and if they never learned to eat right themselves they're really victims too in a way.
Re: Cause of Obesity: Learned Behavior From Same Gender Parent?
kids dont become obease because of there obease parents they become obease with the food choices there parents introduce to them, and its not about blame its about what is right for your kids and i made the choice when i had kids, what i put in there mouths was really going to matter to me.

I might disagree a bit on this...if you regularly take your kid to the doctor for yearly checkups and the like, your doctor will say something if you have an overweight child.
A caring parent in my mind should say, gee doc, what are the risks? What can I do to fix this? Doctor says well, it could lead to health problems down the road; your child could probably use some more exercise, and should try to eat healthier too.
If the parent doesn't know what is/isn't healthy, then hopefully they say.....Gee doc, how does one eat healthy? Doctor HOPEFULLY should point parent to valuable resources, and parent HOPEFULLY will read said resources, ask questions, etc.
I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but a lot of kids could be helped out if the parents actually cared more about their child's well being.
