Valencia Montessori School was founded with the purpose of creating a natural space where children develop and grow in harmony. With the intention of offering a learning environment which respected the personality and the potential of each child, we started two years ago with the project that will open in September 2012. In Valencia Montessori we firmly believe that every child is unique, and we welcome their diversity and its individual growth during the first and most important years of their life.
The school teaches the Montessori method as the vehicle of learning based on observation, it helps to develop the intellectual curiosity and security in oneself as the beginning of a happy learning. As a complement to the All-day Montessori program, we offer activities that inspire new knowledge and experiences that can be found regularly. Activities such as gardening, art, crafts, music, kitchen, help to cultivate values such as patience, persistence, concentration, attention and internal balance with oneself.
To provide a learning according to the needs of each stage and according to the Montessori philosophy, it was necessary to find a space that operate in harmony with the natural environment. Therefore we reached the only place in Valencia where our House of Children could become a reality. The school, with 450 m2 and 300 m2 of outdoor patio, is located in the Natural Park of Bioparc, located on Av. PÃ­o Baroja 3, Valencia.
As a sustainable school , our goal is to operate in balance with the natural environment, therefore rehabilitation and work of the centre has been developed with the criteria for an eco-efficient building. Also in Valencia Montessori School we will make use of recycled materials, organic cleaning products and will disclose the respect towards the environment that surrounds us everyday.
The school teaches pedagogy Montessori within the British System , following the rules and guidelines of the Ministry of education of the United Kingdom. Taught by native teachers AMI (Association Montessori International), the school provides English as a vehicular language. Spanish is important in learning, reading and writing skills and culture, integrated into the weekly schedule of the school.
Valencia Montessori School will initially host the periods aged from 2 months up to 6 years with a short term forecast to continue with the Primary stage. Therefore, we will have classrooms ready for each cycle, in addition to a garden patio and kitchen where children can learn to make bread and experiment with textures, smells and real tastes. Montse Bradford , specialist in child nutrition, is the expert who will design the daily menus for our school based on ecological and local products that provide everything you need for energy, nourishing and balanced feeding.
Nevertheless, Valencia Montessori School is a place where learning and the natural world are connected. In this way, we contribute through education to the preparation of each child during their first years of life, cultivate their capacity for learning, self-motivation and ethics for any environment where they may find in the future.
