MONTESSORI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL bases its teaching method upon the work of Maria Montessori, an Italian educator and doctor. It focuses attention on the whole child, considering not only the intellectual needs of the child, but the physical, social and emotional needs as well. The goal of the Montessori program is to lead each student to explore and understand the world and become active and accountable members of society.
The Montessori curriculum presents an integrated, thematic approach that unifies the study of the physical universe, the world of nature, and the human experience. Literature, mathematics, the arts, writing, history, social studies, civics, economics and sciences all complement one another in the Montessori curriculum.
The Montessori classroom is carefully designed to encourage the development of self-motivation in learning through diverse experiences that speak to the child's imagination and need to discover. Lessons are introduced simply and concretely in the early years and are reinforced several times over the years at increasing degrees of abstraction and complexity. Students learn through manipulation of specially designed materials that enable them to form a sensorial impression before being introduced to concepts on a more abstract level.
There are three different age levels in each classroom. Older children serve as models for younger children. They also reinforce their own skills by demonstrating lessons to the younger child, thus increasing self-confidence. Students remain with the same teacher for two to three years, thereby strengthening the development of a strong sense of community with classmates and teachers.
Learning to work and play together in a peaceful and caring community is one of the most important life skills that Montessori teaches. Through the study of diverse cultures, children come to appreciate and respect the contributions that others make to society.
Clear and distinct guidelines, both in the classroom and throughout the school, offer children the structure which supports the development of self-motivation and responsible leadership.
The highly trained Montessori staff understands the stages of child development and scope and sequence of the Montessori curriculum. They provide the necessary resources:
to nurture a desire for life-long learning
to develop the skills necessary for continued success in school
to develop self-discipline and motivation for learning
Family involvement is an important part of every child's learning. At Montessori, parents are partners with teachers and the school community. They are able to take an active role in the child's education by serving as teacher assistants, office and library helpers, committee members and educational tour assistants. Parents are encouraged to visit the school prior to enrollment to evaluate its suitability for their child.
