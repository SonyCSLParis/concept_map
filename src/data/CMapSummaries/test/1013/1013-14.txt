Where did Montessori come from? Montessori (pronounced MON-tuh-SORE-ee) education was founded in 1907 by Dr. Maria Montessori, the first woman in Italy to become a physician.  She based her educational methods on scientific observation of children's learning processes.  Guided by her discovery that children teach themselves, Dr. Montessori designed a "prepared environment" in which children could freely choose from a number of developmentally appropriate activities.  Now, nearly a century after Maria Montessori's first Case dei Bambini (Children's House) in Rome, Montessori education is found all over the world, spanning ages from birth to adolescence.
What is the difference between Montessori and traditional education? Montessori emphasizes learning through all five sense, not just listening, watching, or reading.  Children in Montessori classes learn at their own, individual pace and according to their own choice of activities from hundreds of possibilities.  Learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline, and a love of learning.  Montessori classes place children in a three-year age group (3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and so on), forming communities in which the older children spontaneously share their knowledge with the younger ones.  Montessori represents an entirely different approach to education.
Is Montessori good for children with learning disabilities?  What about gifted children? Montessori is designed to help all children reach their fullest potential at their own unique pace.  A classroom whose children have varying abilities is a community in which everyone learns from one another and everyone contributes.  Moreover, multi-age grouping allows each child to find his or her own pace without feeling "ahead" or "behind" in relation to peers.
What ages does Montessori serve? There are more Montessori programs for ages 3-6 than for any other age group, but Montessori is not limited to early childhood.  Many infant/toddler programs (ages 18 months to 3 years) exist, as well as elementary (6-12), adolescent (ages 12-15) and even a few Montessori high schools.
Are Montessori children successful later in life? Research studies show that Montessori children are well prepared for later life academically, socially, and emotionally.  In addition to scoring well on standardized tests, Montessori children are ranked above average on criteria such as, following directions, turning in work on time, listening attentively, using basic skills, showing responsibility, asking provocative questions, showing enthusiasm for learning, and adapting to new situations.
Wh at special training do Montessori teachers have? As with the choice of a Montessori school for children, an adult must also exercise wisdom in choosing a teacher training course.  Anyone can legally use the name "Montessori" in describing their teacher training organization. One must be sure that the certification earned is recognized by the school where one desires to teach.  The two major organizations offering Montessori training in the United States are the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI, with a U.S. branch office called AMI-USA) and the American Montessori Society (AMS).  Most training centers require a bachelor's degree for admission.  Training ranges from 200 to 600 pre-service contact hours, and covers principles of child development and Montessori philosophy, as well as specific uses of the Montessori classroom materials.  Montessori training centers can be found across North American and around the world.
Who accredits or oversees a Montessori school? Unfortunately, there is no way to limit the use of the name "Montessori."  Parents must carefully research, and observe a classroom in operation, in order to choose a real Montessori school for their child.  There are several Montessori organizations to which schools can belong.  The two major ones operating in the United States are the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI, with a U.S. branch office called AMI-USA) and the American Montessori Society (AMS).  Parents considering placing a child in a Montessori school should ask about the school's accreditations and affiliations.
What is the best way to choose a Montessori school for my child? Ask if the school is affiliated with any Montessori organization.  Ask what kind of training the teachers have.  Visit the school, observe the classroom in action, and later ask the teacher or principal to explain the theory behind the activities you saw.  Most of all, talk to your child's prospective teacher about his or her philosophy of child development and education to see if it is compatible with your own.
How relevant are Montessori methods in today's world? While appropriate changes have been made to the original Montessori curriculum (including the introduction of computers and modifications to the Practical Life exercises to keep them culturally relevant), the basic concepts have not changed much since Dr. Montessori's lifetime, because the developmental stages of humans have not changed.  Meanwhile, contemporary research and evaluation seem to be confirming Montessori's insights.
How does the teacher keep track of so many students who are working independently? The teacher keeps a record of every student's lessons and projects.  Daily observations is another tool that teachers use to evaluate each student.  This helps students lean how to evaluate their work, and progress and communicate with their teachers their strengths and weaknesses.
How do teachers deal with discipline? Conflicts arise naturally out of interaction between different people.  The balance of freedom and responsibilities found in the Montessori Classroom teaches each child to have respect for self, for others, for the classroom, and for the materials.  In addition, with guidance from teachers and staff, children at each level are taught conflict resolution skills.  They begin the life-long process of learning to respect others' opinions and to search for win-win solutions for conflicts.
How will I know how my child is doing? Parents meet with teachers, twice a year, for an in-depth conference;  and a third narrative report is issued at the end of each school year.  Parents are strongly urged to educate themselves about Montessori Philosophy and the curriculum.  Parents are also encouraged to schedule visits with their child in the classroom, and to contact teachers with questions and concerns.
Are all Montessori schools the same? Montessori is not a trademark name and simply refers to the Montessori method of teaching.  Though different Montessori schools will share similarities, from a few to many, each school is independent.
How do children fare in the transition from Montessori to traditional schools? The transfer from Montessori is generally quite smooth.  There is, of course, an initial adjustment period, just as there is in any transfer between schools.  Academic success is not affected by the transition from Montessori to traditional school.
