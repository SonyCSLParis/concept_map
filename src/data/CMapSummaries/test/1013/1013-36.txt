Types of Private Schools
Our nation is blessed by a rich diversity of private schools -- some rooted in religious traditions, some that provide intensive academic experiences, some that reflect a particular pedagogy, and some that are specialized for specific populations. These diverse schools and strong, often faith-based, communities help fulfill the American ideal of educational pluralism and collectively contribute to the common good. The types of schools linked on this page are associated with CAPE's member organizations , which collectively represent about 80 percent of the private school community nationwide.
