My son is 16 months, and I'm looking into preschools to send him part time once he is about 2 years old. I am a fan of Montessori, and am looking in Alameda. Has anyone had a good experience s/he would recommend? Tara
My 3-year-old son is about to finish his first academic year at The Child Unique and we've been very pleased with it (BPN should have reviews on it ... I think I've sumbitted one). They have a very caring staff and nice kids and parents. Children may be enrolled full or part-time with varying scheduline options available starting at age 2. I think they have a waitlist for next year. Child Unique Parent Sept 2005
Re: Montessori Schools in Alameda I am an Alameda parent who sent my then-pre-schooler to 2 different Montessori schools and was disappointed (to a greater or lesser extent) both times. As an educated professional, I was not concerned about my child's academic preparation for kindergarten, and believe that in preschool it is more important for children to learn social and emotional skills. I am really baffled as to why! the Montessori method is so popular. I believe that this method is only appropriate for a small percentage of children, yet it seems to be the main option available. Some of the reasons it was not right for my child include: emphasis on individual work and lack of opportunities for children to work and play together, lack of emphasis and opportunity for children to be creative and use their imaginations (they can decide which materials to use and for how long, but the materials have a ''right'' way, like a puzzle, rather than providing any opportunity for experimentation and creativity). I also did not think that the focus on academics at the expense of play and fun was appropriate, and threatened to squelch my daughter's joy in learning. I will definitely not be sending my outgoing, social, imaginative, and fun-loving second child to a Montessori school. --! not a Montessori fan
We are trying to decide between Berkeley Montessori and Montessori Family for our 3 yr old. We enjoyed our tours of both but they have very different characteristics. If you have experience with both, could you offer your thoughts? Also, if he stays through elementary school, I'd love to hear from parents with older children. Montessori Mom
I am looking for a culturally diverse montessori school for my 2 year old twins. I'm looking for something in the El Cerrito, Richmond, or San Pablo area. My twins need a loving and academic environment that most day cares do not provide. We would like it to cost less than $750 per month, per child. Tamara
My son is thriving in a Montessori preschool program and I'm wondering if it makes sense to keep him in that environment through elementary school. I'd love to hear from parents who have chosen this route. Is there a particular Montessori school in either Oakland or Berkeley that you would recommend? (I'm planning on touring the Renaissance School in Oakland soon.) How do Montessori kids transition into more traditional schools, either public or private, later on? How academically prepared are they? Any pros and cons you can share would be greatly appreciated! Montessori mom
