A balanced curriculum of academics as well as music, art, gymnastics, cultural studies and character development help promote a well-rounded individual who has the highest potential to excel in every area of life.
Our Philosophy
Carmel Valley Montessori School is based upon the philosophy of Maria Montessori providing a positive environment for growth and learning; offering experiences that enrich and enhance each child's cognitive, language, social, emotional, physical, creative and moral development. In a spirit of love and respect our teachers are responsive to each child's individual needs. Children have opportunities to create, explore the environment, learn problem solving and personal interaction skills, and learn concepts through hands-on experiences at their own pace and interest level. This fosters independence, positive self-concept and enhances the child's natural love of learning.
A core curriculum of math, language, science, geography, reading, arts and crafts, music, gymnastics, cultural studies, and character development.

Education at the Carmel Valley Montessori School
Education at our Montessori Schools are based on the principles developed by Maria Montessori and extended and refined by Montessori teachers in America and around the world. At the heart of this approach is the belief that children will best reach their potential by having the freedom to learn in a classroom especially prepared for exploring under the careful guidance of a trained teacher.
The benefits of a Montessori education include the following:
Provides individual instruction: Each child is allowed supervised free choice of classroom activities and freedom of movement based on his or her interests, so long as these activities do not disrupt the well-being of the class.
Promotes initiative and self-confidence: Materials are structured and presented to enable self-teaching and independent activity, which develops self-reliance.
Emphasizes learning through the use of tangible sensory objects, which reinforces memory and understanding.
Provides a supportive, carefully prepared environment scaled to the needs of the child and designed to teach a sense of responsibility and self-discipline.
