Montessori del Mar Bilingual School is pleased to announce the purchase of property for its new home; two hectares of beautiful land less than 500 meters from the entrance of La Pura Vida road, between Cobano and Montezuma.
This completes the licensing requirements of the Ministry of Education. The construction is planned to start in January of 2008, aiming to open our new school by August of the same year. This will be the first Montessori school offering education up to the 6th grade in the whole of Costa Rica.
Our dream is to create an international Montessori bilingual school for primary and secondary levels, the continuation of the work started in 2003 at our present location in Cabuya. Our goal is to open a space for the education of our children in the beauty of Nature, the biggest laboratory. The idea is to bring together excellent, creative and experienced Montessori educators, artists and scientists who want to become part of our project and help to make it a reality. Our mission 'education for life, through freedom, in a beautiful and prepared environment,' will be taken a step further. Your contribution at this point will help finance building the schoolhouse, computer lab, library, kitchen, multiuse pavilion, playground and gardens. This pioneering endeavor is an important part of your children's future that is being structured now. This is an ongoing experience. We invite you to join us.
