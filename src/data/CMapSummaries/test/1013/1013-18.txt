Personal tools
Montessori instruction expects that the student will be responsible for his/her own success and actively involved in purposeful learning. Montessori principles for students feature:
Large blocks of uninterrupted work time
Multi-age grouping
Integration of subject disciplines
A variety of work options
Cooperative groups and peer teaching
Creation and care of the environment
In addition to rigorous academic standards, the Montessori environment compels us to give special attention to the concept of "valorization" which is the development of the adolescent physically, socially, and emotionally. This helps students discover the best of themselves. The learning environment is structured to allow students to think deeply and critically as they become leaders who take responsibility for their education and community through the following experiences:
Daily self-reflection
Student-led conferences
Community building and student leadership
Service learning projects
Montessori at Lakewood
This new magnet middle school continues the DPS Montessori experience that students currently have at Watts and Morehead Montessori Magnet Elementary Schools, along with space for additional students from a variety of backgrounds through the DPS magnet school lottery process.
Students and parents sign contracts for all their classes indicating their understanding of the three pillars of Lakewood: Community, Self and Academics. Core curriculum areas taught within each of the Montessori classroom communities are language arts, math, science and social studies. Electives include a second language (Latin), visual arts, physical education/health, strings, band and chorus/theater. Advanced mathematics is also taught as a separate class. Students learn through discovery, including having their own garden at the school, participating in community service projects and joining one or more of the many clubs and activities at the school.
The following published books and Internet articles have been selected as tools for learning more about Montessori education, particularly at the middle grades level, and about adolescents. Additional parent resources are available through our school's guidance counselor Meg Graham.
