The Montessori School of Madison
March 2012. I chose the school because I sought Montessori education with warm, supportive teachers in a cozy, homey atmosphere. I also liked the full day kindergarten program.
My two sons have had wonderful experiences with this school. They have made tremendous strides academically and socially, and love going to school. My older son will be entering First Grade this Fall, and the teachers have prepared him with reading and writing skills that will assist him going forward.
Pros: The teaching approach is very individualized and child focused. The teachers are very experienced and supportive. There is a lot of interaction with the parents.
I really have not experienced any Cons, except that the school only goes to Kindergarten and I wish it went for more years.
