Montessori Schools and Methods
Montessori is both a teaching method and a type of private school. Some public schools have Montessori classrooms. The schools were started in 1907 by Dr. Maria Montessori. Maria Montessori originally trained as physician. It was from this interest in science and scientific inquiry that she developed her method by observing children as they learn. The basis of her method is that the pace of student learning is as variable as the student.
Age Groupings
In Montessori schools and classrooms students are grouped according to age. For instance one group is 0-3 years, the next group is 6-9 years, the third group is 9-12, etc. The varying ages within a group allows each child to learn at their own pace. In addition, it allows each child to teach another.
Free Range Learning
Classrooms are set up to accommodate learning centers for each subject. Students can move freely around the room, working first on one subject and then moving on to the next. In the course of a school day the student will spend time on every subject.
Interwoven Learning Modules
Rather than teaching subjects in isolation, the Montessori method takes a theme for the day or the week and explores that theme through history, math, science, music, reading and writing. This method allows the student to have a greater understanding of the topic.
No Grades
In Montessori schools and classrooms there are no grades. Learning is measured by the student's portfolio of work and the teacher's observations.
According to recent statistics students taught using the Montessori method score above average on standardized tests and perform well in college and life. There are more than 4,000 Montessori schools in the United States.
