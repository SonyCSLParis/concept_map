Re: Homeschooling? Pro's/Cons and overall do you think the pro's outway the cons?
we are considering montessori for our little one. the public schools on the south side of atlanta (and most of the rest of the state for that matter) are horrid. they are doing more charter schools now and we live near one so that may be an option, but i don't think their survival is a given.
we haven't seriously considered home schooling.

I'm not sure where exactly Gwinnett County is in relation to your comments, but Mobile is interviewing the Assistant Superintendent of their school system to be head of Mobile's school system...

The fact that there isn't even a basic test that parents who wish to homeschool must pass is mind boggling. I'm a fan of completely doing away with compulsory attendance, but if we are going to have it, we may as well make it consistent instead of having any idiot being able to "teach" their child.
There are two skills that homeschooling cannot teach, and they are "doing what the boss says" and "politicking to get ahead," both of which are necessary to succeed in today's world.
No offense but generalizations such as that are why I concern myself with public school. To many stereotypes and overall generalizations is why public education is going downhill. To be honest most people are feeling this way about the public school system. Why so the increase in the number of children to private schools, charter schools, and homeschooling. All 3 are on the rise in this country because people are very aware of the issues in the public school system.
In regards to the 2 skills you listed you can learn that from homeschooling. As I have mentioned before my wife is a product of homeschooling and is very successful. Probably moreso than most from a public school. Both in the college classroom and in the real world working. Again a poor generalization on your part.
In the end only one thing matters and that is the parents who raise the children. It does not matter where one obtains their education if the support system they receive at home is there. They will learn what they need to survive and succeed in the world with the right parenting.

We looked at Montessori school and really like some of the ones in our area that have the language immersion programs. But we opted for the Waldorf school here and are really happy with the program so far. A little pricey but I do it for my children.

My daughter loves it and they go outside every day no matter what the weather is. They really push creativity and self development. I was a little hesitant(mostly because lack of knowledge) at first, but my wife really liked the school so I visited and saw the setup. Now my daughter is only in preschool but my biggest concern at her age was paying for a glorified babysitting service. We visited alot of schools and it was put the kids in a room and play with noenvironment that challenged or enriched their daily environment.
BTW I also really like the Montessori school style as well. I like how they have several age groups in one setting to give a greater diversity in learning with peers at different stages.

thanks for the info. the plan is to keep our daughter at home til she is three then start her in a program like this. she loved how the montessori system engaged the kids (she taught the 3-6 year olds)

Again...there are better options. Always. Private schools, move to a different school district...anything but homeschooling. It is a joke, plain and simple. Public education in many places is so bad it can't be fixed. But homeschooling is never the best option unless your kid lives in a bubble.

you are stating this as fact, yet it is clearly opinion, curious as to why you feel so strongly against home schooling
