Montessori schools
The Montessori concept of the Prepared Enviornment , that the school house should be designed to facilitate independent learning and exploration, fits well with The Natural Learning Initiative's (NLI) focus on designing the outdoor environment so that children will have the opportunity to discover nature and the joy of playing outside.  This connection is evident in the designs NLI developed for Montessori Schools at several sites in North Carolina and in Ithaca, NY.
Located on the border of Chapel Hill and Durham, the Montessori Community School (MCS) campus is home to 230 students, ages 18 months to 14 years. The campus includes twelve classrooms, a gym, art and music center, outdoor learning centers, a field, and existing wooded area. "MCS is a learning community of children, parents, faculty, and staff, each with distinct roles and responsibilities. Adults work in concert to support children's development as active, peaceful, life-long learners and global citizens." The school emphasises outdoor learning .
The Natural Learning Initiative (NLI) worked with the Montessori Community School and the Montessori Community Association (MCA, parent-led organization) to create naturalized play and learning settings for the primary school area and the Spark Center (arts and music center) serving the elementary school.
The Natural Learning Initiative (NLI) worked with the Montessori School of Winston-Salem , North Carolina, to create a Design Program and Schematic Master Plan for the development of the school grounds.
The Natural Learning Initiative (NLI) worked with the Children's Montessori School of Jacksonville , NC, on Project Greenspace, a comprehensive Design Program and Master Plan. The community design process for the project included a series of workshops with children, director and directresses, parents, administrators, the Board of Trustees, and community stakeholders.
The Elizabeth Ann Clune Montessori School of Ithaca, New York consulted the Natural Learning Initiative to create a comprehensive design program and master plan for the school grounds, with the mission "to nurture the hearts, minds, and spirits of children and adults in the Ithaca community through stewardship of the land."
