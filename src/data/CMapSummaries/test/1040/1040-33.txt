Learning Disabilities

In my younger days, words were my enemies. Today, they are beloved friends. How can someone who struggles to read be able to thrive when writing? I don't know. The brain is something I can't understand. But thankfully there are tools like Text Aloud that help compensate for my lack of reading comprehension. I can read, but the longer I read, the more my mind disengages. Soon I find myself reading words but not thinking about what they mean. It takes great concentration for me to stay focused, and it can be taxing. Without even realizing it, I'm thinking about something unrelated to what I'm reading. I know everyone does this to some extent, but we audio learners are stuck in that limitation.
With audio I can listen while I read, and it keeps me engaged. Plus, Text Aloud has a follow along feature that highlights words as they are read. This tool has had more of an impact on my reading and writing than any other tool or discipline. I call it my proofreading partner.
Reading is one skill that's hard to get along without. Fortunately, the text-to-audio feature of the Kindle eReader opens the world of reading to people like me. And Text Aloud provides the opportunity to read articles, emails, and my own writing like never before.

Step 5 - Change the role of parents. As my little flipbook explains, the IDEA has a fundamental design flaw. That flaw is the requirement and expectation that parents will enforce it. Thus, if parents do not agree with a school's program or program, they need to 'advocate' for the child and fight the school. Instead, parents should be able to work with school and build positive relationships, and not be forced to 'advocate' for their child against their school.
We need to end this design flaw.
As well, the law puts the onus for a child's progress on the school district. Parents can sue schools if their children don't receive a FAPE or make progress. My book discusses how the law fails to encourage parents to partner with schools for the benefit of their children. The incentives in the law are wrong, and defy common sense.
Having a child with a disability is more than challenging enough. The law should not make it more difficult. It currently does exactly that.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will be reauthorized within the next year or two.
To prepare for the reauthorization of IDEA, several disability organizations are sponsoring a survey that seeks to answer this question: "Are parents treated as equal partners in planning their children's education?"

The Listening To Learn Guild is a 501 (c) 3 organized in Denver, Colorado by a group of dedicated parents and volunteers. The mission of the Guild is to increase awareness about reading acquisition problems which are caused by physical and visual impairments, dyslexia, and other learning disabilities. The vision of the Guild is to provide every child in Colorado with access to appropriate assistive technology tools to meet his or her individual education goals.

A student at our school has been having a little trouble [and said].. that a friend heard about adult ADHD on TV. His friend told him that he could get special treatment, like untimed tests and rescheduling of exams if he was diagnosed with ADHD, along with free meds.
My question is do you think a kid can actually fake it well enough to get diagnosed by a doctor? Do you know of any cases where kids have faked ADHD? I would have to think or hope that the tests are thorough enough to weed out fakers.
I expect to see the number of abusers sky rocket especially in the teenage set. There are about 5 to 7 million kids diagnosed with ADD. That number is sure to go up because of information on the internet that encourages and teaches abuse (see below)? It just scares me to think that kids can find information like this on the internet.
So I went looking for the questionnaire. There's exactly one citation, an 2006 article from Abram Magomedov at eXiledOnline, a somewhat fringe publication.
This should be exciting news for anyone interested in reading acquisition, school success --even the achievement gap.
There are two needs here:
Additional sources of funding
Researchers with a background of evaluating reading instruction
The International Dyslexia Association will be awarding multiple $20,000 grants to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-sensory, structured, language instruction (MSL). While MSL has had decades of success, there has been very little replicated research to point to.
ADHD, Part One: Exploring Causes and Treatment
ADHD, Part One: Exploring Causes and Treatment adhd experts causes and treatments Nearly one in 10 kids is diagnosed with ADHD - so it's not surprising that parents, medical professionals, and educators alike are debating these rising rates. From potential causes to non-drug treatment strategies, experts tackle some of the hot-button issues surrounding ADHD today.
ADHD, Part 2: Diagnosing, Medicating, and More
Medicating kids for ADHD is a controversial topic among medical professionals and parents. Naysayers believe that children today are simply overdiagnosed and overmedicated, while advocates endorse these meds as a child's best chance at normalcy. Get the facts from our ADHD experts:
Parents are naturally interested in their child's school experiences and services. For most students, academic and social achievements closely relate to the degree to which parents are involved with their child's schools. In special education, however, we know little about these issues. Few studies have examined parent knowledge of the IEP process, parent advocacy skills, or parent-school relations, nor how each relates to parent stress. Similarly, we do not yet know the degree to which a parent's ability to navigate the IEP process and collaborate with the school might be related to aspects of parents or of children with disabilities.
This study attempts to understand parent-school collaboration by asking about 5 distinct areas. After a first section in which we request basic demographic information, we then ask about characteristics of the child with disabilities; characteristics of the respondent; and characteristics of parent-school relations and services. We end this survey by inviting you to tell us-in your own words-about your overall experiences in dealing with the school and what advice you would give to parents and teachers.
All together, this survey should take about 25-30 minutes to complete. Your responses to this questionnaire are entirely voluntary and anonymous; they will be used in our ongoing studies of parent-school relations. In addition, you may withdraw your participation at any time and may choose to skip any questions that you wish.

This is an important essay from Dorothy Bishop on the interplay between research, naming conditions, and understanding conditions such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, and other neurodevelopmental conditions.
Right this second, I don't have time to do more than put up a quote from the post, but we will be discussing the essay in depth.
We are stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place. It seems that if we stick with medical-sounding labels for neurodevelopmental disorders, they are treated seriously and gain public recognition and research funding. Furthermore, they seem to be generally preferred by those who are affected by these conditions. However, we know these labels are misleading in implying that we are dealing with clearcut syndromes with a single known cause.
So here's a proposal that attempts to steer a course through this morass. We should use the term 'neurodevelopmental disability' as a generic term, and then add a descriptor to indicate the areas of major difficulty. Let me explain why each part of the term is useful. "Neurodevelopmental" indicates that the child's difficulties have a constitutional basis. This is not the same as saying they can't be changed, but it does move us away from the idea that these are some kind of social constructs with no biological basis. The evidence for a biological contributory causes is considerable for those conditions where there have been significant neurological and genetic investigations: dyslexia, SLI, autism and ADHD.
