Learning disabilities can lead to many problems in a person's life, low self-esteem being a primary concern. Students dealing with learning disabilities may also suffer from socialization problems and have an increased dropout rate in school.
Learning disabilities are related to neurological disorders that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, store, and respond to information. Learning disabilities refer to a group of disorders that can affect a person's ability to listen, speak, write, read, and process mathematical concepts. The United States has almost 2.9 million school-aged children who are classified as having specific learning disabilities and are receiving some kind of special education.
If you are a parent of a child who you believe may have learning disabilities, look for the following early warning signs:
Speaks later than most children
Pronunciation problems
Slow vocabulary growth, often unable to find the right word
Difficulty rhyming words
Trouble learning numbers, alphabet, days of the week, colors, shapes
Extremely restless and easily distracted
Trouble interacting with peers
Difficulty following directions or routines
Fine motor skills slow to develop
Natural Remedies for Attention Deficit Disorder And other Learning Disabilities
Identifying learning disabilities early can help a child succeed not only in school but also socially; however, it is never too late to seek help for this condition. There are many adults who may have always suffered from a learning disability and just didn't know. People with adult learning disabilities can obtain satisfaction and relief from discovering that they have this condition-and stop blaming themselves for struggles in their early life.
It is not certain what causes learning disabilities. A common theory among scientists is that learning disabilities stem from subtle disturbances in the brain structure and function. There is no racial or ethnic link, however, studies show a connection with socio-economic backgrounds. It is more prevalent in low-income families.
A Learning disability may be attributed to the following:
Problems During Pregnancy
Head Injuries
Nutritional Deprivation
Exposure to Toxic Substances
Without sufficient building blocks within the brain's neural network, learning can be cumbersome and delayed, concentration is labored, and attention to task cannot be sustained. Memory and retrieval skills cannot be appropriately maintained.
People with learning disabilities are hypothesized to have low Acetylcholine levels and adverse lipofuscin populations within the Cholinergic neural pathways, making a competitive response more difficult and trying. For individuals with attention deficit disorder or a learning disability, the brain becomes so "noisy" that it becomes necessary to shut down all processing of the senses altogether, thus avoiding all stimulation.
When deprived of the required number of neural connections needed to process the information smoothly, competition between various stimuli results. This is thought to occur within the population of individuals with learning disabilities, ADD and ADHD , whether from child or adult populations. When taken regularly, this formula is designed to complement the body's natural calming and balancing agents, which help to focus attention and relieve over-and-under activity.
