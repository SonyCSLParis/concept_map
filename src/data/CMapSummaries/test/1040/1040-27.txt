Oftentimes when a child is diagnosed with ADHD doctors and parents alike are quick to prescribe medication as a treatment. This is largely due to the fact that the effectiveness and safety of these medications are espoused by mental health professionals. Furthermore, medication is an easier and less time-consuming treatment than behavioral therapy or other forms of treatment for ADHD. However, as most parents who are making the treatment decisions for their children have not had the opportunity to attend Ph.D. programs in medicine, they are typically not versed enough in health care to know that there has been controversy about the long-term effects of ADHD medicine.
Most Common ADHD Medication
The most common ADHD medications children are prescribed are stimulant drugs, like Ritalin. Unfortunately, there are many different possible side effects that accompany ADHD stimulant medications, such as appetite suppression and erratic eating patterns, growth suppression, irritability when the medication is wearing off, headaches, stomach aches and facial tics. However for the most part ADHD medications are relatively safe; and if someone taking the drug does experience side effects from it, the dosage can be lowered or they can be prescribed a non-stimulant alternative. It is generally agreed that ADHD drugs may help control symptoms and behavioral problems of some children with ADHD on a short-term basis. However as Eric J. Marsh and Russell A. Barkley point out in their book "Treatment of Childhood Disorders," the long-term prognosis of individuals with ADHD who are treating their illness with medication is less clear. Similarly, it is also unknown what effect, if any, taking ADHD medications for extended period of time will have on a person's health. What is known is that many patients eventually stop taking their medication after months or years of treatment. This could be due to unwanted side effects or the feeling that the medication is no longer helping to improve focus.
Ambiguous Nature of Long-term Effectiveness of ADHD Medication
Despite the seemingly ambiguous nature of the long-term effectiveness of ADHD medication, some mental health professionals argue that, on average, individuals receiving pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD do better than those without it. Yet there is one caveat: not all individuals respond to the ADHD medication that they are prescribed, and those who are good responders early on have a better long-term prognosis than those that have a hard time finding a medication that works for them. Other mental health professionals question that point of view. A 2009 study showed that although ADHD medications were helping children with ADHD a year after therapy had begun, these same children were no different than the control group after eight years. Thus, the results of this study bring into question whether ADHD medications help on a long-term basis at all. However one of the alternatives ADHD medication that has been proven to benefit children  on a long term basis is behavioral therapy. Likewise, certain lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet low in sugar and processed foods, getting enough sleep and exercising can also have a positive effect on ADHD symptoms. Clearly it is very big decision to start a pharmaceutical regiment to treat a child's ADHD. As such it is important for parents to keep in mind that ADHD medication is not a cure for ADHD and it may not even be effective in some individuals, whether they take it on a short- or long-term basis. While ADHD medication does help control ADHD symptoms in some patients and improve disruptive behavior and lack of focus in school, it is certainly not the only treatment option and others, such as behavioral therapy, may be worth exploring. ...........................
Bonnie Terry's Additional Comments on ADHD Medication...
Remember, sometimes children as well as adults that have been diagnosed with ADHD also have other learning issues that can be magnify their ADHD. These are learning problems related to auditory, visual, and tactile/kinesthetic processing. There are 9 different areas of vision, auditory, and tactile/kinesthetic processing that affect learning. Often when you address these processing areas the ADHD isn't as problematic as it was to begin with. Again, you want to check out all avenues to make learning easier for your child. You don't want to leave a stone unturned. Your child is priceless. To find out if there are other root causes interfering with your child's learning, see our Learning Disability Screening Tool or give Bonnie Terry, M.

Misdiagnosed Attention Deficit Disorder - ADHD
Nearly 1 million children in the US are potentially misdiagnosed with ADHD simply because they are the youngest and most immature in their kindergarten class. This is according to Todd Elder's research at Michigan State University as reported in Science Daily . Think about this for a minute. Almost 1 million children are potentially misdiagnosed with ADHD. And what happens when a child is misdiagnosed? More often than not that child is prescribed to take behavior-modifying stimulants such as Ritalin and they don't need them!
Diagnosing ADHD or Misdiagnosing ADHD
There are two important criteria to look at in the diagnosis and misdiagnosis of ADHD. The first is the most obvious criteria. Look at the behaviors a child is having, doing, exhibiting. For example, can they sit still for a lesson or while you read to them? The second criteria is critical! What is the age of the child doing the behavior, and do look at others of the same age. If a child can't seem to sit still but he is only 5 and the rest of the children are 6 or close to being 6, that is a big difference! It is much harder for a 5 year old to sit still than for a 6 year old to sit still. Teachers and medical practitioners need to remember this when evaluating whether a child has ADHD.
Additional Situations to Look at Regarding Diagnosis and Misdiagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder - ADHD
1. Is the problem you are seeing situational (e.g. Only one parent sees it as a problem; at school they don't seem to have the problems, when they are with dad they don't seem to have the problems, or when they are with mom they don't seem to have the problems.) 2. If only one parent is having problems with the child, it may be a problem with parenting skills (e.g. Yelling at the child such as "You don't act like you want to be part of the family." or "Get up right now or else" and then not follow through with a consequence.). 3. If the teacher is the only one having a problem it may be a problem with the way the teacher is dealing with the child or it may be an inexperienced teacher. 4. Other times a child is misdiagnosed with attention deficit disorder is when the actual problem occurs through a shutdown of either their auditory system or their vision system.
When the auditory or vision system becomes overloaded, it shuts down and needs a break. When either of these systems shuts down temporarily, the child often appears to be not paying attention. What is happening is either the vision system or the auditory system is resting.
Unfortunately, often the child has trouble bringing themselves back to the activity at hand. A gentle reminder to come back to the activity is all that is needed in this instance, and it may need to be given each time they aren't paying attention until the child learns to come back on their own.
Remember, a diagnosis of ADHD requires evidence of multiple symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity, with these symptoms persisting for six or more months -- and in at least two settings -- before the age of seven. The settings include home and school. Additionally, teachers cannot diagnose ADHD, but, their opinions are often used in decisions to send a child to be evaluated for attention deficit disorder. You know your child. Remember, the diagnosis requires evidence of multiple symptoms in at least two settings, so if the school is seeing symptoms and you don't see symptoms at home the problem might not be one of ADHD. That is NOT to say that you don't want to look into it. Obviously something is going on that is interfering with your child's learning and you do want to see what you can do to make learning easier for them. "Many ADHD diagnoses may be driven by teachers' perceptions of poor behavior among the youngest children in a kindergarten classroom," Todd Elder states. "But these 'symptoms' may merely reflect emotional or intellectual immaturity among the youngest students."
So, what happens educationally when your child has ADHD?
Educational Problems Caused by ADD/ADHD
Although attention deficit disorder (ADHD) is not a learning disability, ADD/ADHD obviously affects performance in a school setting, as well as affects other parts of their life. Kids and adults with ADD have neurological gaps that interfere with the cognitive processes of memory, concentration, and attention span. In other words, kids with attention deficit disorder have often missed out on instruction because they were distracted and attending to other things instead of the instruction that was being given. Assignments, especially homework may be missed because they were distracted and attending to other things instead of the assignment that was being given. When kids aren't paying attention in class, they often miss bits and pieces of skills, content, and the easy tricks to becoming efficient learners. Dr. Daniel Amen states that school problems can include: o Restlessness o Short attention span and distractibility o Impulsiveness o Procrastination o Trouble shifting attention o Forgetfulness o Writing disabilities o Reading disabilities o Visual processing problems o Auditory processing problems o Unusual study habits o Difficulties with timed situations such as timed tests.
ADHD and Learning Disabilities or Dyslexia
About 70% of kids with ADHD also have dyslexia, learning difficulties or learning disabilities. School age kids may have problems with reading, spelling, writing, penmanship, or arithmetic. The question then becomes one of, how do I help my ADHD kids to do well in school when they have such trouble attending to the instruction? How do I help them to improve their memory, mental energy, organizational skills, and expressive vocabulary so they can succeed in the school setting? There is a lot you can do to help your ADHD child in school. The key is to determine what specifically is interfering with their learning. Is it only the ADHD, or have they been misdiagnosed with ADHD? Are there other underlying causes interfering with their learning in addition to ADHD? For more information on the underlying causes of learning problems, you will want to check out our comprehensive behaviorally based learning assessment . It is critical to your child's success, whether they have attention deficit disorder or not or whether they have been misdiagnosed with ADHD or not, to find out what other underlying causes may be contributing to your child's educational struggles. Once you know exactly what is going on, there is so much you can do to help your child whether they have ADHD, have been misdiagnosed with ADHD or have a learning difficulty or learning disability.
Looking for help with learning reading
and don't know where to start?
Learning Reading Help Can Be Divided into 3 Categories
There are actually 3 Roadblocks to Learning Reading , 3 Roadblocks to Learning Writing , and 6 roadblocks to Learning Spelling . Whether your child has dyslexia, has an identified learning disability, is falling through the cracks at school or is even gifted... understanding what is interfering with their learning reading skills makes the difference in reading success or reading failure. 3 Roadblocks to Learning Reading . 1. Learning Reading: Phonics Related Problem This is the type of problem where it is almost 'painful' to listen to your child read. This happens more frequently with children in the primary grades, although older children can also have this difficulty. This first roadblock to reading success is phonics related. Phonics reading problems are when a child 'jumbles' or mispronounces the words as they are trying to decode (the ability to sound out printed words) or encode (the ability to put letters to the sounds that make up a word). You have no idea what the word is that they are trying to read until you look at it yourself. 2. Learning Reading: Fluency/Visual Tracking Problem This is when you listen to your child read the selection doesn't make any sense to you. You know something must be missing. The second reading roadblock to reading success is where it takes your child what seems like forever to read the sentence or they have skipped, omitted, or repeated words when reading. They may even re-read the whole selection and still not get meaning from it because they have missed bits and pieces of what they have read. This fluency problem happens quite often with children of all ages, from 1st grade to adults. Over the years I have found that most students that have reading problems or are 'reluctant readers' have fluency/visual tracking problems that interfere with their reading. 3. Learning Reading: Lack of Language or Vocabulary Problem This is when your child reads and you know they don't understand the meaning of the words they are reading.This prevents comprehension or being able to understand what you read. Many children don't have a large base of language or vocabulary. This happens often due to poor visual memory or auditory memory skills. This makes reading comprehension difficult. This problem may not be noticeable until the 4th grade and above due to the relatively common vocabulary that is used in reading material for younger students. There are solutions to each of these roadblocks to learning reading skills .

What can you do during the winter weather to help your kids improve their skills? This question is a frequent one for me. Parents are always interested in helping their kids, but it is sometimes hard to stay motivated, especially during the winter months. The following activities work well with all kids, whether they have dyslexia, LD, ADHD, are falling through the cracks, or are gifted. I have done the activities successfully with all of them! I have two favorite things to do to not only help my kids, but to stay motivated doing it too. The first thing is to have more frequent game nights, playing educational games - learning games like The Sentence Zone , The Comprehension Zone , or The Math Zone . When you play games with your kids, they build skills while having fun and get a lot of modeling from you too. At the same time you get to have quality family time, so it is a double win situation. The other activity I like to do is to have an evening where I might turn the heat up a degree or two, and everyone gets dressed in 'summer' clothes, and we have a 'picnic' on the floor of the living room. Afterwards, we might tell stories to each other - what I call 'add-on stories.' In these stories one person starts off and then the next person adds on to the story. We keep going round and round and the story gets longer and longer. The only thing is, the kids have to pay attention and so do you, so what you add on makes sense to the story. This builds listening comprehension and memory as well as a really good time. Hope this is helpful! Bonnie Terry, M. Ed., BCET
