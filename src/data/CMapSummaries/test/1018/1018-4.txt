Credit cards are good for building up credit history. But using credit cards can often be injudicious. In other cases, someone may not have a credit history that's good enough to get a credit card. Others may simply not have a credit history at all - minors and immigrants, for example.
For all of you, there are ways you can build a credit history from scratch, without using a credit card. The basic idea behind credit is that you have to take a loan or credit, and then you have to repay it in time. If you don't do either one of these, you will not have a good credit history.
The first thing you have to do is to open a checking and a savings account. If you are a minor, or new to the country, or simply do not have a credit history, here is where you start. It may be difficult for you to get a credit card, but if you have a social security number, you can get a checking account from most banks. If you are a minor, some banks will not let you open an account. Don't worry, go to the next bank. Many will have no problem with giving you a checking account.
One good way to start a credit history is to piggyback on someone else's credit history. One way to do this without a credit card is to have someone co-sign a loan for you. This will help you get a loan you may otherwise not be eligible for, and if you pay your debt well, and in time, you can build a great credit history.
Another method for students is to get a student loan. People worry about student loans. They think it's going to turn into a giant you cannot get off your back, like those stories in the fables. That may be true if you don't manage your debt well, or if you don't do well at school and become jobless. But if you get your act together, study hard, get a good job, and pay your loans in time, dude, there's nothing stopping you from using your student loan to create an enviable credit history.
Finally, if you have gone beyond the student stage, and you are not a recent immigrant, just a regular, middle class American, and you have still somehow managed to mess up your credit, here's what you can do. Get a small installment loan, for whatever. Get a small loan for a car, or to pay off some payday loans , or for giving your wife a gift, whatever; and keep the loan small, and the loan period not more than a couple of years. Then service that loan like there's no tomorrow. If you repay that loan in time, properly and without problems, just this running installment loan program alone will boost your credit skyway.
