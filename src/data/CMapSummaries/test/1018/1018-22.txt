There are two types of loans that can be affected by your credit score - Parent PLUS loans and alternative private loans (such as a Sallie Mae Signature loan).  For the Parent PLUS loan, the credit score of the parent will be reviewed by the lender to determine the parent's loan eligibility.  For alternative private loans, the lender will review the credit score of the student and the cosigner (usually a parent) to determine if the student is eligible for a loan and what interest rate will be offered.  A lower credit score means higher risk to the lender which translates to a higher interest rate for the student.
Because many students have either no credit history or an adverse credit history, it is very difficult for a student to be  eligible for an alternative loan without a creditworthy consigner. We encourage all students to apply with a cosigner, as they may benefit with a better interest rate.
Federal Direct loans are not affected by a student's credit score.
