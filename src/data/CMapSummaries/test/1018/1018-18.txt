It is possible to get a student loan for College without a co signer. These types of loans are called No Co Signer Student Loans. Not very student is going to have great credit and some are not going to have the luxury of a person who would co sign a loan to them. That is where these loans come in handy. The best way to get a loan without a co signer is through Federal Student Loans and Grants. The best type of loans is the kind that there is no credit check needed. These loans are well known loans provided by the federal government.
One of the most popular is the Stafford Loan; this loan is based not on a need basis but based on the application alone. With the Stafford Loan, the loan is subsidized which means that the United States Federal Government will pay off the interest on the loan until you graduate College. There are also unsubsidized Stafford Loans but the student would be responsible for the loan and the interest as soon as the loan is paid out. The Perkins Student Loan is a loan for both the Graduate and Undergraduate Students. The only main condition to these loans is that the student applying for the loan has to be proven to need the loan more than they don't. This is done by financial paperwork and documentation.
Another non co signer loan is the William D Ford Student Loan; this loan is one of the biggest providers of Federal Aid for Undergraduate and Graduate Students. There are other loans under the Umbrella of the William D Ford Loan, these are the Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans and Consolidation Loans. These loans so have some eligibility requirements such as you have to enroll in school at least half time. These loans have an interest rate of 8.25% fixed, loans with fixed interest rates are easier to calculate how much money you have to pay back.
Remember these are student loans and they have to be paid back. It is very important that you make a plan for repayment right away. Even though the loans are not due until after graduation the interest on unsubsized loans starts right when the loan gets disbursed. You don't want to default on these loans; they can really affect your credit score. There are many different types of repayment plans, the Standard Fixed monthly where the payments are up to 10 years, the Extended Fixed monthly payments where the payments are 12 to 30 years. There are Graduated Payments that start off with a lower rate and then increase over the years these loans are to be repaid from 12 to 30 years.
Repayment is just as important as choosing which federal loan is good for you. You can really start off rocky with your credit history if you need help with repayment. If you see yourself starting to fall behind with loans then call your lender and try to defer payment a little longer.
