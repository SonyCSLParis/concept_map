Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans
The Federal Direct Loan program is available to all U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents who meet basic Federal requirements (i.e. student has never defaulted on a Federal loan and/or is not currently involved in filing bankruptcy). As of July 1, 2012, the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan will no longer be available to graduate and professional students. The Unsubsidized Loan program will still be available with the maximum loan amount being $20,500 per academic year. The terms and conditions of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan are:
Interest accrues interest upon disbursement. Payment of accrued interest is not required, but is suggested.
Application Process
In order to apply for Federal Direct loans, students should submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The fastest way to submit a FAFSA application is online at www.fafsa.ed.gov . The priority deadline is March 1. While missing the deadline will not affect the type of funding you receive, it may affect processing time. Students receive financial aid notifications after all application requirements are complete. The notification process begins late in April.

Additional Student Loans
Students can choose to borrow additional student loan funds to supplement the Federal Direct Loan program. A student?s total financial aid (including: scholarships, fellowships, and all education loans) cannot exceed the total cost of attendance for the academic year. The two loan programs used by MBA and MAC students are the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan and private education loans. Note that these loans are approved based on a student's credit. Each loan considers credit in a specific way (see below for loan details).
Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan
Credit requirements: A good credit history or no credit history (no delinquent accounts or bankruptcy on credit report)
Interest accrues upon disbursement. Payment of accrued interest is not required, but is suggested.
Interest rate: 7.9% fixed
Origination fee: 4%
Annual maximum: estimated financial aid budget minus other financial aid
Private Education Loans
Non need-based
Credit requirements: Students may be required to have a minimum credit score to be approved for the loan funding without a co-borrower. Students with credit scores below the required minimum may be asked to provide a co-borrower for loan approval.
Interest accrues upon disbursement. Payment of accrued interest is not required, but is suggested.
Interest rate: Variable and normally based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR.
Origination fee: Most lenders do not assess an origination fee of private education loans (i.e. loan amount disbursed equals 100% of the amount requested/ approved) but this may depend on a student's (and, if applicable co-borrower's) credit.
Annual maximum: estimated financial aid budget minus other financial aid.
Grace period: 6-9 months, depending on loan.
Repayment period: 10 years standard.
UNC Chapel Hill does not have a preferred lenders list for private education loans. However, over the past few years, MBA and MAC students have borrowed private education loans primarily through Wells Fargo , Chase , and Discover over the past few years.
How Students Receive Financial Aid
All financial aid funds transfer to the University Cashier's Office at the beginning of each term and students receive financial aid refunds around the first day of classes via direct deposit to their personal bank accounts. Students must meet all disbursement requirements in order for loans to transfer to UNC.
Tuition and fee charges are due before the beginning of each term. Students who receive financial aid can defer their charges. Instructions for deferment are included on the billing statement.
Private Education Loan (for students without a U.S. co-signer)
UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School offers a loan for international MBA students that does not require a co-signer through Coastal Federal Credit Union . Please note that MAC students are not eligible to borrow this loan. Below are terms and conditions of the loan program.
Maximum loan limit cannot exceed the amount of tuition and required fees for each academic year (loan cannot be borrowed to cover expenses associated with summer enrollment prior to the academic year).
Minimum loan amount is $5,000.
Minimum monthly payment amount is $100 for standard repayment.
Prime Rate + 5.00% (annual adjustment) with origination fee of 2%.
Unpaid interest that accrues while the student is enrolled in school will be capitalized (added to the principal loan amount) at the time of repayment.
Repayment begins six months after graduation or separation from the University. There is never a penalty for prepayment of loans.
Possible interest rate reduction of 0.125% if automated payments are made during repayment period.
Education Loans from the Student's Country of Citizenship
All students should explore loan options offered in their home countries. These programs will have specific requirements for the borrower as outlined by the lender, bank, or government so the student should contact the lending agency directly for details on each program. Below is a list of possible programs, but this is in no way a comprehensive list.
Global Student Loan Corporation ( http://www.globalslc.com/ ). Currently available for Indian Students, but may expand to other countries in the future.
