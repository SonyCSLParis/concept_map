Private/Alternative Loans
As the cost of college rises rapidly, and federal loan limits fail to keep pace, the private loan business has grown quickly. In theory, these loans are used to fill the gap between available federal aid, and what students and families can afford to pay out-of-pocket for college costs. In practice, unfortunately, many borrowers take out these higher cost loans without first exhausting their federal student assistance options. These private loans lack the more affordable, fixed rates, and flexible repayment options that federal loans have. Prospective borrowers should exhaust all federal grant and loan options (including PLUS loans) before considering a private student loan.
Banks and other financial institutions make private student loans without any financial backing from the federal government.  Some schools also have their own private loan products.
Interest accrues on all private loans from the time they are disbursed, although interest costs can sometimes be deferred and capitalized when repayment begins. There are many different types of private loans, each program with its own rules and requirements. Private loans are also called private-label or alternative loans, and are often provided by the same lenders that also provide federal FFEL loans. Because the government does not subsidize private student loans, the rates and terms are not regulated the way they are for federal loans, which makes private loans more risky and expensive.
Loan Rates, Fees, and Limits
Private loan terms and conditions, including interest rates and fees, are generally based on your credit history or a co-signer's credit history. This means that low-income students or those with negative credit histories will likely receive more expensive loans. Like government loans, private loans are supposed to be used only to finance postsecondary education (including books, transportation, and room and board). Check your school's estimated cost of attendance and consult with the financial aid office before deciding on a private loan amount.
Private lenders may pressure or even require you to get a co-signer. A co-signer is a relative, friend or someone else who agrees to be responsible for your debt. Co-signers must understand that they are responsible for paying back the debt just as if they had received the money.
There are very important differences between government loans and private loans. If you take out a private loan, you will not be eligible for the same types of discharge, deferment and forbearance options that are available for federal loans. However, some private lenders are now offering limited discharge options for private loan borrowers. Sallie Mae, for example, has announced  a disability discharge for Smart Option Student Loans.  The company will also forgive any unpaid balance if a primary borrower dies.    Wells Fargo announced a similar program in December 2010.  Some private student lenders also offer deferments and forbearances, but these vary by program.  Read your loan contract very carefully to learn about your private loan's particular terms, conditions, benefits, rates, fees, and penalties. Private lenders do have to honor any promises they make about terms and benefits.
The new Truth in Lending Act provisions also require private education lenders to obtain a completed and signed Self-Certification form before making a loan.
In March 2008, NCLC released a report on problems with private student loans.  A 2009 report describes the lack of options for financially distressed private student loan borrowers and offers recommendations to help these borrowers.
ALERT: The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, signed into law in July 2010, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB ).  The CFPB officially opened on July 21, 2011.  The agency has authority over most private student lenders.    You can find out more about the CFPB in this NCLC Reports article .  The CFPB's complaint hotline phone number is 1-855-411-CFPB (2372).  It is available in both English and Spanish.
