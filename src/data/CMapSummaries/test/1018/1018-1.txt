Student Loans Without Cosigner
Student loans without cosigner are mainly federal government loans. These are non credit based student loans, available to any student that fills out a FAFSA. But even though these should be your first choice, they will not be enough for any private and many public colleges. Federal loans have annual and lifetime limits that leave many students with tuition gaps to fill. One method of filling the gap is federal parent college loans .
If your problem is that a parent does not have a great credit rating (but would be otherwise willing to cosign a loan) this could be your solution. Parent PLUS college loans have more lenient credit requirements than private loans do.
If a parent loan is not approved, the parent can either find a good credit cosigner, or the student can become eligible for a higher loan amount (up to the limit of an independent student).
Private student loans usually means 'big lender' loans. Banks (the few who still offer student loans) like PNC or giant student lenders like Sallie Mae will usually say that cosigners are strongly recommended for lower rates.
Allow me to translate: You will not get a loan approved unless you have a good credit (working) cosigner, or you have a 2-year, good credit and working history (and are currently working full-time, with a good debt-to-income ratio). Learn more about private loans ...
These are another form of private loan. Typically, state governments enter into agreements with lenders to offer loans at reduced rates. ( Connecticut has the best rates.)
Credit union lenders sometimes team up with employers and state governments to offer their customers student loans. Although the rates are better, the requirements are the same as the big lenders regarding credit and cosigners.
Some peer to peer lending platforms offer student loans without cosigner to upperclassmen (juniors and seniors). The logic is that students are less likely to drop out (the leading cause of default) with two+ years of college completed.
If you choose this option, make sure you fill out a profile well before you need the money; these are not quick student loans .
These are sometimes student loans without cosigner. It depends on the school. Some schools will automatically include these loans in your award to make up your cost of attendance gap. They are funded by a school's endowment, offered to needy students and usually do not require a cosigner.
Other schools do not offer these loans as a matter of course- you have to ask. If you appeal your financial aid for college , ask about institutional loans. These may be short or long-term. The short-term loans are more likely to be student loans- no cosigner needed.
For Profit Schools
For profit schools very often supply student loans without cosigner to their enrollees. They have to or they would not be able to get students, because they:
charge more than the federal financial aid limits on grants and loans
target low income students and families
supply no institutional grant or scholarship money
Typically, these schools' rates are in line with the average price for second or third tier private schools. They either contract with a private lender to supply loans (after federal aid is maxed out) or they lend their own funds.
So, if you know that you will need to borrow more than federal loans and you do not have a good credit cosigner, you might want to check out some for profit schools. But also check their defaulted student loans rate and do not borrow more than you will be able to pay back.
If your parents have a poor credit history and are not acceptable cosigners for that reason, it makes sense to search for student loans without cosigner. There are some situations where it is possible to get a college loan without one. But looking for "bad credit student loans" is a waste of time at best. These types of searches will not get you the funding you need, but could lead to identity theft or computer viruses.
No reasonable business wants to lend unsecured money to borrowers who will make them spend even more on collection/legal fees. If you find one who will, you should make an effort to understand what they gain from the transaction- read the promissory note carefully.
Student loans without cosigner were more common before the recession. Searching for unsecured, non credit based student loans is a waste of time, unless your situation matches one of those mentioned here.
