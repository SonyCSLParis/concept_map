First time borrowers at the School of Law must complete an Entrance Counseling Interview and a Master Promissory Note.
FEES: There are fees associated with borrowing a Federal Direct Stafford Loan. Beginning with the 2012-2013 award year, the U.S. Department of Education will be charging a 1% fee.This fee is deducted from the loan by the Department of Education before the proceeds are credited to your student account.
The maximum amount of the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan is $20,500.
Unsubsidized Stafford loans are not need-based, meaning they're available to all eligible students regardless of how much financial help they need. Also, you're responsible for the interest on an unsubsidized Stafford loan as soon as the School of Law receives the money. You can choose to pay the interest while you're still in college, but you don't have to.
The aggregate amount that a graduate/professional student may borrow is $65,500 in Subsidized Stafford loans. The total Subsidized and Unsubsidized that a student may borrow is $138,500. Both of these figures include ALL federal student loans borrowed, including loans obtained as an undergraduate.
Alternative Loans
Students may choose between the Federal Direct GRAD PLUS program and private educational loans. When choosing a loan program and a lender, it is important to consider the rate of interest, the flexibility of repayment plans, and the repayment incentives that are offered by the lender.

Loan Deferments

Students may also request a deferment form from their lender to be completed by the Registrar's Office. Additional information on loan deferments, as well as repayment and cancellation options, is available from the U.S. Department of Education at this web link: http://studentaid.ed.gov/students/publications/repaying_loans/index.html .
