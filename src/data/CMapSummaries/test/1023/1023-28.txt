Bullying - What Parents need to know
Every child has a right to an education that is free from fear and intimidation
Bullying behaviour is unacceptable and should not be tolerated
What is bullying?
"Bullying is repeated aggression, verbal, psychological or physical, conducted by an individual or group against others. Isolated incidents of aggressive behaviour while they should not be condoned, can scarcely be called bullying. However when the behaviour is systematic and ongoing it is bullying"
(Department of Education: Guidelines on Countering Bullying in Primary and post primary students - Dublin 1993)
Types of Bullying
Verbal Bullying
Persistent name calling or slagging which hurts, insults or humiliates. Using a person as a butt of jokes.
Physical Bullying
Pushing, shoving, kicking, poking, tripping one up. It also includes assaults or threats of physical assaults. It may take the form of damage to one's clothes or personal property, such as school books, bags or bicycles.
Gesture Bullying
Non-Verbal threatening gestures, glances that convey threatening and frightening messages.
Socially isolating, excluding or ignoring someone.
The deliberate extraction of money or other items of property accompanied by threats. Victims may also be forced to commit anti-social acts, for example theft or damage of property.
Direct bullying consists of physical aggression, hurtful words or nasty gestures. Indirect bullying involves ignoring, isolation, spreading rumours or falsehoods, passing around nasty notes or writing up insulting remarks on blackboards or in public places.
Parents and teachers have a responsibility to ensure that pupils are not involved in bullying other pupils. Communication between the home and school is essential as it allows bullying behaviour to be challenged and remedied.
10 Signs that Your Child is Being Bullied
The following signs and symptoms may suggest that your child is being bullied:
Visible signs of anxiety and distress - refusal to say what is wrong
Unexplained bruising and cuts
Damage to clothing or personal possessions, e.g. books, pencil cases, pens
Deterioration in school performance; loss of concentration, interest and enthusiasm for school
Requests for extra money
Reluctance to go to school
Unexplained changes in mood or behaviour, e.g. becoming withdrawn, clinging, attention seeking, aggressive towards brothers, sisters or parents
A lowering of self-confidence or self-esteem
Difficulty in sleeping
Repeated complaints of headaches or stomach aches
These signs do not necessarily mean that your child is being bullied. However if they occur repeatedly, they should be investigated.
Making contact with your school
If you suspect or have evidence that your child is being bullied contact your school. Do not feel guilty about making a fuss about bullying. By reporting it you will be helping many children as well as your own.
If your child pleads with you not to contact the school stress that you will be discreet. Consider contacting the school in a manner that causes least publicity e.g. letter or telephone. This avoids public discussion of why you were seen at the school which may put your child under pressure. It may, however be necessary to make an appointment to meet with the appropriate member of staff.
The school may need time to investigate the allegation. Investigating incidents of bullying can take time. It generally involves interviewing pupils and/or asking them to write an account of what happened. Teachers and parents may also have to be interviewed.
If your child is being bullied
Assure your child, if he or she did not provoke the bullying behaviour, that the problem lies with the bully and not with your child. This helps to lessen or remove the self blame that many children experience when they are bullied
Advise your child to report all incidents of bullying to a member of staff
Do not advise your child to retaliate physically. If the child who bullies is stronger than your child they may get hurt. It may also give the bully an excuse to fight back, e.g. self defence
Explain to your child that children who bully want an upset reaction. Humour, silence or an assertive response often prevents further attack.
If your child is engaged in bullying behaviour
Talk to your child in a calm manner, setting an example of good aggression control
Try to find out why your child is bullying. Might he/she be responding to stress in the home or school?
Try to explain the ill effects of unacceptable aggression
Try to help your child to understand the distress that victims of bullying feel
Stress the importance of respecting and tolerating individual differences
Set realistic, firm and consistent guidelines and rules to help your child to control his/her behaviour
Try to either channel your child's activity and energy into some constructive pursuit e.g. sports or formal group activities that have a high level of supervision or some activity that involves caring for pets, people or plants
Key Facts
A child with high self-esteem is less likely to be a victim of long-term bullying or to become involved in bullying behaviour. You can help to build up your child's self esteem by giving them the gift of acceptance. Frequently praise, reward and recognise their efforts and unique qualities.
The positive parental voices will become internalised and will help to nurture your child's self esteem. Also give your child responsibility. Seek their help or opinion on issues.
This helps to communicate a belief in their resourcefulness and also give them a sense of belonging and a positive sense of their capability.
Bullying may have serious long-term consequences for children who bully and for those who are being bullied, thus bullying should no longer be regarded as a normal part of growing up that children have to learn to tolerate.
Effective strategies exist that help prevent and counter bullying behaviour. When parents and the school community work together bullying is less likely to happen.
