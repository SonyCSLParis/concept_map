Children suffer from different types of bullying. Verbal, emotional and physical bullying are sadly common place in many schools. Many school policies state that for the behaviour to be defined as bullying, it must be intentional and repeated. Unfortunately by the time the school or in fact parents become aware of the bullying the emotional effects on the child are already showing. You might find your child is becoming withdrawn, has difficulty sleeping, doesn't want to go to school and perhaps has even started self harming.
Bullying is a serious problem. It can happen in a variety of everyday situations and sometimes the bully can be an adult, sibling, stranger, so called friends or sadly even a teacher.
As long as the school is aware of the problem and your child is willing to tackle the bully, then I can have great success with overcoming the emotional baggage that bullying carries for children. I will focus on increasing your child's confidence level and self esteem. I also work with them to view their bully in a different way and to cope with their emotions and feelings towards their bully in a more resourceful way.
Treating this particular problem involves close work between you as the parent, your child and me as the therapist.
