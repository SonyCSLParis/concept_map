Bullying is a topic that has received attention in the media in recent years. It is something that many parents worry about - whether their children might be the victim of bullying or "the bully."
So what is bullying and why is it important?
Bullying behaviour is a form of harassment that involves one or more people who are more 'powerful,' harassing one or more people who are less 'powerful'. It can involve methods that are:
physical (hitting, pinching, kicking)
psychological (standover tactics, gestures)
social (exclusion from a group, rumours)
sexual (verbal, nonverbal gestures, comments, touching)
Bullying generally requires three people or groups in order to occur:
The person/s who does the bullying
The person/s who is bullied
The by-stander
There is now evidence that being bullied as a child can have life-long effects and can include serious psychological and physical damage to the victim. It also allows bullies to learn inappropriate methods for relating to others in society. School communities have now recognised the importance of dealing with this issue and there are expectations that bullying will be identified and dealt with educational settings. There are a range of strategies and programs that schools can implement.
Bullying is not a problem that goes away by itself and if left unchecked can create a culture wherein such behaviours can seem acceptable.
What if my child is being bullied?
Children who are bullied have higher levels of stress, anxiety, illness and suicidal ideation. If you suspect your child is being bullied, then (despite your child's protestations) you should:
Speak with the teacher as soon as possible. You may also need to speak with the Principal
Ask the teacher/Principal what plan the school will implement to stop this behaviour.
Ensure you keep yourself informed regarding how the plan is going and monitor the impact of this on your child
If the school's plan does not appear to have stopped the bullying continue to speak with the teacher/Principal
You can also help your child to develop strategies to deal with bullying. (See reference list for some books and websites to help you). Strategies that help are:
Explain how bullying works and help your child think about why they might have been targeted (it may have something to do with the way they look, or behave)
Work through strategies for dealing with the bullying behaviours when they happen
Role play or rehearse the strategies with your child
Check that they have skills to make and keep friends (to help them become less isolated)
You may need to create opportunities for them to make new friendships
Reinforce that they have been brave to tell, that the adults will also deal with the problem and that they should keep talking to you about it- so that you can all make the bullying stop
What if my child is "the bully"?
Children who bully others are more likely to leave school early, use drugs and alcohol and engage in delinquent behaviour. If your child has been bullying another child then:
Be prepared to hear that your child may be bullying other children
Do not support this behaviour - nothing justifies bullying
Contact and support the school in their stance against bullying
Make some rules for your child -(eg. stay away from the victim, and the others who were doing the bullying)
Check their friendship groups and take notice of the way they relate to each other in their group
Construct or encourage other more appropriate friendships or pastimes
What if my child is one of the bystanders?
Some experts believe that the group creates the climate for bullying to occur. Sometimes the group encourage the bully. They allow bullying to continue by providing and audience and not informing authorities that it is occurring. Some schools have decided to also punish bystanders of bullying.
If your child is the bystander:
Explain how bullying works and help your child think about their part in condoning this (they may have been worried that they might be the next victim if they spoke up against the bully)
Work through strategies for dealing with witnessing the bullying behaviours when they happen
Do not support their behaviour - they also have a responsibility to stop the bullying
Support the school in their stance against bullying
Make some rules for your child, such as: walk away from the bullying, and inform either yourself, (you could then confidentially inform staff that the bullying is continuing) or the staff
Important Message: Bullying can be stopped by school communities and parents working together.
