Case Study:
At St Margaret Clitherow School , parents have been fully involved in the development of a new anti-bullying policy. The approach has been so successful they intend to use it as a model for other aspects of school development.
Seeking to resolve incidents and repair relationships wherever possible
definition of bullying - not all hurtful behaviour is bullying but hurtful behaviour will be addressed.
The importance of working with parents in resolving incidents
You are an important part of...
If you have any concerns or worries about your child's school life please share them with a member of staff
If your child shows changes in behaviour or shows signs such as....., sit down with them and try to establish the reasons
It is important that parents exercise reasonable confidentiality around incidents involving other children
Please do not approach other parents or pupils directly, but refer concerns to class teacher/form teacher/year head/deputy/head etc.
How you can support your child if they are being bullied
Listen and help them record details
Reinforce the importance of telling an adult as soon as possible at school
Help them to tell if they need support to do so
Remember that you do not have the whole story
Help/encourage them to practice agreed strategies so they can use them confidently under stress
Help them to put resolved incidents behind them and move on.
How you can support your child if they are involved in bully behaviour
Remember that many children will become involved in bully behaviours at some time.
The important thing is to help them to realise why they have done so, to know that their behaviour is not acceptable, to have alternative strategies given similar circumstances occurring again, to help them reconcile and repair relationships
Listen and help them record details
Remember that you do not have the whole story
Support them in taking any action or sanction as a positive learning experience
Where a change of behaviour is required, help/encourage them to practice agreed strategies so they can use them confidently under stress
Help them to put resolved incidents behind them and move on.
Strategies pupils can use to keep themselves safe (from bullying) [or have a separate partner leaflet for pupils and parents on this]
An opportunity to give parents alternatives to the be nasty/hit back message:
Don't be intimidated - maintain eye contact and strong, confident body posture
Fogging - remember they are trying to hurt you so don't let them. Think of all the really positive and wonderful things that make you special and unique,
Say "No!" strongly and firmly. Or "I don't like it when you... Stop it!"
Tell someone as soon as possible if someone bullies you
Special support schemes in the school?
Below are some of the kinds of things that could be included in a parents leaflet.
Herts BME Advocacy Service Leaflet
The Herts BME Advocacy Service is hosted by Watford Council for Voluntary Service - an independent charity.
Supporting parents, carers and children who have any concern about any aspect of their education or any situation at a school to which there may be a racial or religious element.
They are funded by Hertfordshire County Council because the service underpins the commitment to openness and equality, and because we believe this service is important to delivering a top quality education throughout Hertfordshire.
Herts BME Advocacy Service operates independently of Hertfordshire County Council.
Parentline Plus , part of the Family Lives Group, is offering parents a series of free family friendly leaflets that help address and tackle the problem of bullying.
Titles include: 'Bullying - Prejudice and Difference', 'Bullying - Via Internet and Mobile Phones' and 'What can I do if my child is being bullied'.
The information contained within Parentline Plus's anti- bullying packs are designed to strengthen families, improve family communication, increase parental coping skills and build on parental confidence whilst equipping adults with a clearer understanding of bullying and the reasons for it whilst promoting self-confidence and self-esteem.
Jeremy Todd, Parentline Plus Chief Executive said:
"Bullying is a real concern to families and parents of bullied children often find the situation traumatic and difficult to manage. Now that the school year is a few weeks old, the signs of bullying may be beginning to show. Some families may find it difficult to help a child who is being bullied and we believe our anti-bullying pack will empower and equip parents to find individual solutions to their own particular problem. Concerned parents should contact Parentline Plus or visit our "Be Someone to Tell" website if they need support."
Parents who wish to receive the free pack can email parentsupport@parentlineplus.org.uk or telephone our 24 hour helpline 0808 800 2222 with your postal address.
