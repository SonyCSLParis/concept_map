Bullying can happen to anyone. All of us, no matter how brave or how old, can feel hurt by the way people treat us. If you are being bullied, you might think that if you tell, it will get worse, or that other people won't like you. Follow for bullying advice for young people
If you have serious concerns about your child's emotional health, you should talk to your GP.
Helpline information
The Family Information Service runs an anti-bullying helpline for parents and carers. If your child is being bullied and you want advice on what to do, call the helpline on 0845 090 8044 or 01926 742274. The helpline is open from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Thursday and from 9am - 5pm on Fridays.
The complaints procedure in schools
If your child is being bullied at school, the following procedures should be followed:
First of all, talk to your child's teacher to see if they are aware of the situation. Remember to try and stay calm.
Check regularly with your child to see if things have improved. If not, make an appointment to talk with the head teacher at your child's school. Take any notes or evidence you have about what has happened.
If after the meeting with the head teacher you are still unhappy, you can write formally to the school's Governing Body. Check your school's Complaints Policy for more information on how to do this.
Finally, if you are unhappy with the Governor's response, you should contact the Local Authority Complaints Officer on 01926 742 256. However, the local authority will not look at your complaint until the school's governing body has been made aware it.
Keep a bullying diary
If you and your child can keep a record about the bullying they have experienced, it can be really helpful when you are talking to your child's teacher or another adult about how to sort it out. Get your child to try and remember and write down as much as they can about what happened, when and where the bullying took place and who was involved in a Bullying Diary.
