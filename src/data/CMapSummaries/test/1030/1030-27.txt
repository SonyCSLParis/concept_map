Public safety officials have used zero tolerance policies that mandate pre-determined consequences for specific offenses (regardless of individual circumstances) for well over a decade to address a number of society's most pressing issues, including drugs and illegal weapons possession. The 1990 Gun-Free School Zones Act adopted by Congress is one such example. Although later ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Act was intended to apply to anyone convicted of possessing or discharging a firearm in a school zone.
Traditionally, such policies have not been directed specifically at the general public. Indeed, many people would argue, as some lawyers have with success, that the one sanction fits all violations doctrine is one which would not be tolerated by a constitutionally protected criminal justice system that contends with the most heinous of offenses. Nonetheless, in recent years, a persuasive majority (more than ninety per cent by some counts) of schools have adopted zero tolerance policies for students who threaten violence or who carry weapons onto school property.
According to the Annual Report on School Safety published by the U.S. Department of Education, 94 percent of schools have zero-tolerance policies for firearms, 91 percent have similar policies for other weapons, 88 percent have zero tolerance policies for drugs 87 percent for alcohol, and 79 percent have zero tolerance policies for violence and tobacco.
Civil libertarians continue to criticize zero tolerance policies, arguing that they target minority and disadvantaged students. A national survey of ten school districts, conducted by California's Applied Research Center, concluded that the rate of expulsion for black students is far higher than for other groups. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and the Rutherford Institute believe that such policies are not well-conceived and, instead are simply overreactive.
In a report published in June 2000, by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, the authors opposed zero tolerance policies, believing that children are being shut out of the education system through the application of Zero Tolerance Policies [sic] often for minor infractions that pose no threat to safety, and yet cause them and their families severe hardship Often African-American, Latino, and disabled children bear the brunt of the consequences of these policies.
According to the Harvard report, Zero Tolerance [sic] has become a philosophy that has permeated our schools; it employs a brutally strict disciplinary model that embraces harsh punishment over education. The report indicates that pursuant to zero tolerance policy enforcement over 3 million children were suspended and 87,000 expelled in 1998 alone. Additionally, according to the authors of the study, in South Carolina, black children were involved in 61 percent of disciplinary code violations, yet blacks make up only 42 percent of the student population.
The Association of Resources for Families and Youth in Maryland agree with the conclusions of the Harvard report, arguing that such policies merely provide school officials with a means to expel high-risk students. The U.S. Department of Education reported that in 1997-98, nearly one in eight black students was suspended from school, compared to one in 30 white students.
The discrimination aspect is but one argument advanced against zero tolerance policies. Much of the recent debate centers on fundamental fairness and the wisdom of eliminating discretion and flexibility in dealing with disciplinary problems. Violations of the law, possession of guns and drugs, are one matter, but what is to be said of a policy that treats nail clippers and Advil the same as a 9mm semi-automatic and a gram of cocaine? In some cases, children punished with maximum sanctions for rules infractions at school under zero tolerance policies have been treated much more harshly than they would have had they been charged with commensurate criminal offenses.
At the other end of the spectrum from those adamantly opposed to zero tolerance are those who seek to expand such policies to include most lesser offenses and rules violations. Judy Davidson, author of Comprehensive Crisis Management for School: An Inservice Guide for All School Personnel , believes that administrative policy can play a significant role in prevention as well. She argues that zero tolerance of weapons on campus also should be supported by a zero tolerance policy regarding bullies and harassment, including emotional, physical, and sexual. Bill Modzeleski, director of the U.S. Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools program believes that zero tolerance policies are needed to maintain order among thousands of children. I don't want my kid in school being threatened ... being harassed ... being bullied.
As is the case with many policy debates, especially when policy is implemented, the devil is in the details. Ron Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center, reflects the beliefs of many school officials and school boards across the country, noting that the majority of zero tolerance policies are well established and well enforced. His view is consistent with that of an increasing number of authorities who believe zero tolerance for law breakers is essential to maintaining order. But he allows that zero tolerance and expulsion don't go hand in hand. To him, the policy simply means all misbehavior will have some sanction. It doesn't mean you bring the maximum punishment for every transgression. Arnold Goldstein, director of the Center for Research on Aggression at Syracuse University, and a strong supporter zero tolerance policies, appears to agree. He maintains that the key to making such policies work is giving principals the discretion to exercise fairness and common sense.
After Congress passed the 1990 Gun-Free School Zones Act (18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)), which prohibited possession of a firearm in a school zone, it was challenged by a student who carried a firearm onto school property. In U.S. v. Lopez , the Supreme Court found that the Act exceeded the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As a result of the challenge, in 1994, Congress passed a new Gun-Free Schools Act (20 U.S.C.  8921) which mandates that any school receiving Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) funds establish a policy requiring a one-year expulsion for any student carrying a firearm onto school property.
In Kansas, in 1995, in James v. Unified School District No. 512 , a student expelled for possessing a firearm on school property sought a temporary restraining order requiring the board to permit him to take his final exams or, alternatively, to allow him to be awarded the grades earned through the date of expulsion. He also sought to be allowed to enroll in school again the following year. The court ruled in favor of the school, concluding that the school's expulsion policy and process comported with due process requirements.
In 1996, in D.B. v. Clarke County Board of Education , the Georgia Court of Appeals held that permanent expulsion of a student for disciplinary reasons does not conflict with or violate a student's constitutional right to free public education or a compulsory school attendance statue, and that a student's permanent expulsion for stabbing another student with a knife does not violate local school policy or a student's due process rights.
In London v. Dewitt Public Schools , the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found, in 1999, in favor of the schools after a middle school student and his mother sued alleging due process violations when the student was suspended and expelled following an incident with a teacher. The Court ruled that there was no due process violation, that the student failed to establish such violations, and that there was no school district discrimination in its staffing practices.
In Decatur, Illinois, a group of students sued the school board seeking reinstatement after they were expelled for fighting on school property during a football game. Earlier this year, in Fuller v. Decatur Public School Board of Education , the court found in favor of the board, holding that the expulsion satisfied procedural due process requirements, that the equal protection rights of students were not violated, and that the school board had not relied upon zero tolerance in reaching its expulsion decision.
As noted by the U.S. Department of Education in the Annual Report on School Safety, zero tolerance policies alone will not cure the problem of violence in schools. Instead, schools must systematically address the needs of students, school personnel, the community, and the physical plant of the school. For example, 96 percent of public schools now require visitors to sign in, 80 percent have closed campus policies that prohibit students from leaving during lunch, 53 percent control access to their buildings, 24 percent control access to their grounds, and 19 percent conduct drug sweeps. Additionally, 78 percent provide formal violence prevention or reduction programs for students.
Last fall, after the Baltimore school board adopted a stringent zero tolerance policy, school-related arrests dropped by 67 percent and school crime decreased 31 percent over the same period the year before. Whether coincidence or proximate cause, the relationship of the policy to the significant change merits consideration. Not all school systems achieve such results. A Texas study of violence in schools after imposition of zero tolerance was inconclusive.
Infringement of constitutional rights: If the offense includes threats or other forms of speech, policy-makers and educators must ensure that the policy excludes expression protected by the First Amendment. Similarly, the punishment must fit the crime, that is, non-violent, non-serious offenses cannot carry undue penalties.
Statutory authority and due process: Because sanctions are predetermined, due process requirements must be adequately addressed. In Loudon County, Virginia, for example, any case involving a zero tolerance policy is reviewed first by the principal, then by an independent panel, next by the superintendent, and finally, by a special committee under the school board. Additionally, policies must consider special needs for students entitled to special consideration under the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act.
While the primary purpose of educational institutions is academic excellence, zero tolerance policies relate to criminal behavior, hence, such policies are best formulated through a partnership of school and law enforcement officials. The consequences tied to zero tolerance policies require that school boards establish clear, concise processes that include detailed due process mechanisms. As with any safety initiatives, when considering zero tolerance, policy-makers should consider:
the appropriateness of the policy and sanctions in relation to the ages and grade levels involved;
the severity of the punishment in relation to the severity of the offense; and
the educational and other services needed.
Given the changing demographics of many regions of the Commonwealth, consideration of imposition of a uniform zero tolerance policy requires that the interests of a broad constituency be addressed. Such a policy should be part of a comprehensive strategy to keep schools safe that also includes prevention and intervention policies and programs. Additionally, school officials should recognize that such policies provide opportunities to teach students about the law, their rights and responsibilities, and accountability for one's actions.
When serious problems of crime and violence are confronted in any community setting, often emotions run high. Responsive action may be guided more by that emotion than by research and evaluation. Prudent policy consideration would include applied research and examination of existing programs. It may be concluded that zero tolerance policies should address the most severe offenses, that is, behavior that should result in automatic suspension or expulsion. These violations include any that present a danger to other members of the school community. For lesser offenses or violations, officials should retain flexibility in responding to specific situations and students. There is merit in considering a range of sanctions that differentiates mere action from action with intent to do harm.
It is also important to remember that no student is cured by being removed from school for days or weeks or a year. Nor can potentially recurring violent behavior be comprehensively addressed solely through expulsion or suspension. School officials and policy-makers should consider additional immediate responses, services or sanctions for students who are suspended or expelled through a zero tolerance policy, as well as the long term impact upon the school community of reducing remedial options in favor of imposing the harshest of penalties. In some instances, temporarily addressing the school's problem may only transfer, and on occasion exacerbate, a chronic condition for the community.
If we accept as a general premise that the purpose of zero tolerance policies is to create as safe an environment as possible for the education and social orientation of all children while removing subjective standards for imposition of punishment, it would follow that we should consider the wisdom of amending procedures that treat Advil and nail clippers the same as cocaine and firearms. We can support absolute zero tolerance and mandatory expulsion or say we do not tolerate while leaving sanctions open to flexibility and discretion. Need zero tolerance for unacceptable behavior equate to zero options for school officials?
