SCHOOL PLAN FOR MANAGEMENT OF STUDENT BEHAVIOR Policy Code: 4302
Each school must have a plan for managing student behavior that incorporates effective strategies consistent with the purposes and principles established in policy 4300 , Student Behavior Policies. School officials are encouraged to implement a system of positive behavior support and to seek other positive, innovative and constructive methods of correcting and managing student behavior in an effort to avoid repeated misbehavior and suspension.
A. COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN
The plan should address: (1) the process by which student behavior will be addressed, including any use of a disciplinary committee and the means by which students at risk of repeated disruptive or disorderly conduct are identified, assessed and assisted; (2) positive behavioral interventions and possible consequences that will be used; and (3) parental involvement strategies that address when parents or guardians will be notified or involved in issues related to their child's behavior (see policy 4341 , Parental Involvement in Student Behavior Issues).
No school plan for managing student behavior may authorize the use of corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is the intentional infliction of physical pain upon the body of a student as a disciplinary measure. It includes, but is not limited to, spanking, paddling and slapping. The board prohibits corporal punishment, believing that other consequences are more appropriate and effective for teaching self-control. No teacher, substitute teacher, student teacher, bus driver, or other employee, contractor or volunteer may use corporal punishment to discipline any student. Reasonable force that is necessary to protect oneself or others is not considered corporal punishment. (See also policy 4301 , Authority of School Personnel.)
Principals shall avoid removing students from the classroom for a long period of time, including in-school or out-of-school suspension, unless necessary to provide a safe, orderly environment that is conducive to learning. The principal is authorized to remove students in accordance with board policies for prohibited or criminal conduct or for other behavior that interferes with a safe, orderly environment.
B. PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING THE PLAN
Principals are encouraged to use a team approach in developing and evaluating the school's plan to manage student behavior. On at least an annual basis, the plan should be evaluated based upon data on disciplinary actions taken and the impact on student academic performance. Principals shall report on at least an annual basis to the superintendent and the board on the effectiveness of the plan in minimizing classroom disruptions, referrals to the principal's office and the use of out-of-school suspension. The report also will address the plan's effect on academic performance.
The superintendent also is encouraged to consider, develop and propose new and alternative discipline programs to the board.
