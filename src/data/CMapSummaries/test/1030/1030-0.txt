A Policy for Corporal Punishment in Schools
Corporal punishment may only be given to students who have signed "Parental Consent to Administer Corporal Punishment" form on file in the principal's office. Swats will be given and witnessed by certified personnel in a school office, room, or other place out of the presence of other students. No more than 3 swats will be given in a school day. The swats will be given with reasonable force by a wooden paddle on the buttocks of the student. A discipline form will be signed by the person administering the swat(s), the witness, the student, and will be sent home for the parent/guardian to sign and return to the office.
