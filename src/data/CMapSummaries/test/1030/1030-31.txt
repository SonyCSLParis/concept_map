Discipline and Punishment
The following information looks at the legal rights of students in dealing with discipline and punishment in Queensland State Schools.
Every community has rules. The school community is no exception. You go to school to receive an education. Schools are given certain powers to help all students get the best education possible.
A school can make reasonable rules for the good order of the school and the discipline of students. Schools have the power to enforce these rules by using discipline or punishment.
1. Background
Queensland State Schools aim to promote:
The rights of all students to learn;
The rights of all teachers to teach; and
The rights of all to be safe.
These priorities are designed to ensure that all students are provided with a harmonious environment where they can learn and thrive. Good discipline in a school is required to ensure that schools are able to provide quality education for all students and to guarantee the care and safety of the school community. A harmonious work environment at school increases the chance of students realising their full educational potential.
Every student has the right to be happy and safe while at school. Students also have the right to be treated fairly and with dignity both in and out of the classroom. While a student's right to learn depends on the capacity of teachers to carry out their professional responsibilities in the classroom, both teachers and students have the right to operate in a school environment free from unsafe behaviour and harassment.
The Queensland Department of Education and Training requires that students conform to a number of basic rules consistent with our laws generally. Students are expected to apply themselves to learning, respect individuals and their property, be courteous to other students, teachers and community members and engage in peaceful resolution of conflict.
Violence, discrimination, harassment, bullying and intimidation, weapons, drugs, alcohol and tobacco have no place at school, and are prohibited by the Department of Education and Training.
2. How are school rules enforced?
There are a number of ways in which schools get students to obey school rules. Most experts agree that positive discipline, such as praise and reward for good behaviour, is more effective than negative discipline, such as ridicule or punishment.
Here are some examples of the ways schools create an orderly, safe and disciplined school environment:
Praise and reward:
Giving praise, recognition and encouragement for good work or behaviour, in class or in school reports.
Teaching students to understand the importance of school rules, for example running programs in drug education, conflict resolution or anger management.
Taking away privileges:
For example, stopping a student who behaves badly from going on a school trip.
Time out from class:
For example, sending a student to wait outside the classroom or the principal's office for a short time.
Making students feel embarrassed or ashamed by criticising them in front of the class, or by giving them a unpleasant task such as picking up other people's rubbish.
Detention or extra work:
For example, making a student stay back after school or during lunch time to do extra work.
3. How can I find out what methods of discipline are used in my school?
In Queensland State schools, the school principal is responsible for the behaviour of students. Every school should have a discipline policy or a "Behaviour Plan" that explains the methods used by teachers and the school principal to discipline students who break school rules or behave badly. You or your parent will be given a copy of this plan as soon as it is available, or it can usually be found in the school handbook.
4. How do classroom teachers keep discipline?
The Department of Education and Training guidelines say that schools should aim to develop self-discipline in students by teaching them to accept responsibility for their own behaviour. Schools should make every effort to ensure that time spent in the school environment is a rewarding and relevant experience. Students should feel they are valued, so they are encouraged to do their best and develop respect for their school, their peers and the staff.
Individual class teachers are responsible for managing their own students. Each teacher should endeavour to resolve classroom management issues within their classroom.
5. Can I be grounded or stopped from going on a school visit?
A school can punish you by denying you a special privilege. Any activity which is part of your education is not a privilege. You cannot be denied learning materials, or stopped from going on field trips during school hours, if they are part of your education. But you could be grounded from school socials or sports or cultural activities outside school hours, or from non-educational activities during school hours.
The school cannot ban you from private parties or events organised by students or parents.
You cannot be excluded from school activities such as a school prize-giving, or parents' evening. A school cannot keep school reports from you or your parents.
6. Can I be given 'time out' or sent out of class?
A teacher or the school principal can order you to leave a class or wait in a particular place for a short period if your behaviour is disrupting the class. But if you are out of class for a longer period, for example for more than one school period, you should be supervised and given school work to do.
7. Can a teacher ridicule or humiliate me?
A teacher can criticise your work or your behaviour. But the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) says that school discipline should be given in a way that respects a student's human dignity. Teachers should not subject you to ridicule, offensive personal remarks, or put-downs. Any remark about your sex, race culture or disability may be considered 'discrimination' under the law (see Information Sheet " Discrimination at School " ). In addition teachers, as well as students, should not engage in bullying behaviour. That is any offensive or aggressive behaviour, which can be physical, social or emotional, that is repeated over time.  Such conduct is likely to be in breach of the teachers' code of conduct and also school policies (see Information Sheet " Bullying in Schools ")
You should not be punished by being made to stand in one position for more than a short period, or by having to do an unpleasant job such as cleaning out the toilets. But if you drop litter in class, or in the playground, the school can punish you by making you clean up the classroom, or collect rubbish.
Remember, if you treat teachers and other school staff with courtesy and respect, they are more likely to treat you in the same way.
8. Detention
The principal or a teacher can punish you by giving you extra work in your classroom or in another room.
In Queensland, detention is restricted to 20 minutes over your lunch recess or half an hour after school. Detention at morning break or for an entire lunch break is not permitted. Detention can be given for failure to complete homework, disobedience, misconduct and for breaking school rules.
Under general law, schools can only detain you after school hours with your parents' consent. However, this consent is not necessary if it is not reasonable in your circumstances (for example, if you don't live with your parents). In addition, a school should not keep you back if it will interfere with your normal arrangements for getting home (for example, if you will miss your school bus or your normal ride home).
Teachers should not make you attend detention outside the school grounds.
You should not be left alone for long periods of time during a detention. You should be given meaningful work to do, not humiliating tasks like writing 100 times 'I am a stupid person.'
9. Corporal Punishment
In Queensland government schools, the law permits a school teacher or school master to use reasonable force for the management or control of a pupil under the teacher's care. However, under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC), school punishment must uphold a student's human dignity, and it is unlikely that that use of force in most circumstances will be reasonable.
10. What if I think the punishment is unfair?
The school principal and your teachers have the legal power to enforce standards of behaviour to help the school carry out its responsibility to educate students.
Just as sports' people may question the decision of the referee, some students feel unfairly treated when punished by teachers. A school is not a court of law and cannot hold a trial every time a student is accused of breaking a school rule. Courts will not usually interfere with the way a school disciplines or punishes its students.
If a punishment is serious (such as exclusion from school), the school has to take great care to make sure that the matter is investigated properly, and that the student, and their parents, have a chance to express their point of view. In some cases courts have overruled the decision of a teacher or school principal.
If you feel you have been unfairly treated or are about to be punished, there are several things you can do:
Ask to see the head teacher for your year or the school principal and tell them your point of view;
Ask your parents for support and get them to discuss the problem with the school principal or the school council; or
Get support from your student representative on the school council, the student representative committee, or a youth group, cultural group, or an organisation that gives advice.
It is always a good idea to write down your version of what happened as you see it. If there are arguments about what happened, it will help if the facts are written down as soon as possible.
11. Can a teacher physically hold me?
A teacher can use reasonable force to restrain any student who is likely to cause injury or damage to themselves or others. So a teacher could stop a student from self-mutilation or from behaving dangerously or violently. If necessary, a school can lock a student in a room for a short period until the police or the student's parents come, but only if the student is dangerous to school staff or other students.
12. Can a school suspend or expel me?
Suspension and expulsion are penalties used in government and private schools in serious circumstances. (see Information Sheet " Suspension and Expulsion " )
In general, a government or private school may suspend you if you have committed a criminal offence or engaged in intentional serious violence against a teacher or student. If you are found in possession of either a prohibited weapon or an illegal drug you may also be suspended. (see Information Sheet " Searches and Confiscations " )
If a school does expel you immediately for an offence, without going through the school expulsion procedures, it is possible that the courts may overrule the expulsion if you or your parents challenge the decision. One such example of the courts overruling the school's decision was when a student was immediately expelled for drinking alcohol at a party organised by the school.
13. What else can a school do other than suspend or expel me?
a. Cancellation of Enrolment (Students above compulsory school age)
The law enables a school to cancel the enrolment of a student who is above the compulsory school age (i.e. a student who has completed year 10 studies). This means that if your behaviour is so bad that it amounts to an unwillingness to participate in the general educational program provided by your school, they can cancel your enrolment.
b. Impose a Behaviour Improvement Condition
A Behaviour Improvement Condition is a condition that your school can impose requiring you to participate in a program to manage your bad behaviour (also known as your "challenging behaviour").
A principal is entitled to impose this condition on you if he reasonably believes that your behaviour is of the kind that would usually attract an exclusion from the school. He or she may make your enrolment in the school CONDITIONAL on you participating on this program.
What will happen?
Your principal will give you a notice stating that you will only remain enrolled at the school if you participate in this program, the facts and circumstances that have led to the measure being taken, the time period (which can be no longer than 3 months), and inviting you to appeal against this decision (within 5 school days).
During this 5-day period, the principal will also organise to meet with your parents (or you and another adult if you don't live with a parent) to discuss this course of action.
Once the decision has been made that you will have to comply with the Condition, you can appeal to your principal's supervisor if you are unhappy with the decision or you think it is unfair. The supervisor has the power to confirm, remove or change the decision within 7 days.
If the decision is confirmed, you will have to participate in the program
What happens when I no longer need the program?
The principal will make the decision that you no longer need the program and will remove the Behaviour Improvement Condition. He or she will give you notice of this.
What happens when the program is not appropriate for me?
If the principal no longer believes that the Program is appropriate for your behaviour, he or she is able to change it in a specific way that has been agreed to in writing. When considering this change, the principal can only consider the initial reasons, or initial behaviour that you were judged on in the first place.

The National Children's and Youth Law Centre (NCYLC) has written an open letter to the Federal Minister for Education, the Hon. Peter Garrett, MP.
In the letter, NCYLC are critical of the lack of effort made by the Review of Funding for Schooling panel to seek the views of the students of Australia's schools. NCYLC seeks the Minister's assurance that he or his Department will actively seek to obtain the views of the nation's students prior to finalising the Federal Government's policy on school funding.
