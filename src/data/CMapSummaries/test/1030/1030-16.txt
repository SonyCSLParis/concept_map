The public by a 2-1 margin approves of spanking children in principle, and half of parents say they sometimes do it to their own kids, an ABCNEWS poll found. But an overwhelming majority disapproves of corporal punishment in schools.
Sixty-five percent of Americans approve of spanking children, a rate that has been steady since 1990. But just 26 percent say grade-school teachers should be allowed to spank kids at school; 72 percent say it shouldn't be permitted, including eight in 10 parents of grade-schoolers.
Indeed, even among adults who spank their own child, 67 percent say grade-school teachers should not be permitted to spank children at school.
At Home
Among parents with minor children at home, 50 percent report that they sometimes spank their child, while 45 percent do not. That's about the same as it was in a Gallup poll a decade ago.

Think spanking should be permitted in school
There are big regional differences in spanking. Among Southerners, 62 percent of parents spank their kids; that drops to 41 percent in the rest of the country. Similarly, 73 percent of Southerners approve of spanking children, compared to 60 percent elsewhere.
Even in the South, though, just 35 percent think spanking should be allowed in the schools. Support for spanking in the schools is about the same, 31 percent, in the Midwest, falling to 19 percent in the West and 13 percent in the East.
One other difference in spanking is among education groups. Among parents with college degrees, just 38 percent spank their kids; among less-educated parents, it's 55 percent.
The U.S. Department of Education has reported that school-sanctioned spanking is most prevalent in Southern states - Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Louisiana. There are no state laws against spanking, although 27 states have policies against the practice and this year Pennsylvania is debating becoming the 28th. Spanking in schools is currently allowed in 23 states (although in many districts parents who object can withhold permission for school personnel to spank their kids).
This ABCNEWS poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 25-29 among a random national sample of 1,015 adults. The results have a three-point error margin. Field work was done by ICR-International Communications Research of Media, Pa.
Spanking seems like a simple proposition, but states that allow it in school actually have numerous rules and restrictions on how it's done.
In Alabama, for instance, while the state leaves the specifics up to school districts, it requires districts to go though a careful process in setting rules that must be carefully followed.
The policies are designed through public hearings at which parents, business people, and others outside the school system are brought in to help shape the guidelines.
"It's not meant to embarrass a child. It's meant as a tool of last resort," said Tom Salter, a spokesman for the Alabama State Department of Education.
Generally, the guidelines include some or all of the following:
No spanking of students in front of other students, as it was done in the past
The number of swats a student should receive should be specified
The person administering the punishment must be either a school administrator or someone substituting for the school administrator
There must be a witness present to make sure that the procedure follows the policy's guidelines
Corporal punishment must be a last resort after other non-corporal punishments have been attempted
The person administering the punishment is not the person who the student directly got into trouble with, to assure that there are no emotions involved in the administration of the spanking
The person administering the punishment should take into account the student's sex, size, and their general physical condition
Some policies specify the instrument that is to be used in the spanking, while others say an appropriate instrument must be used
Most policies specify that the punishment must be applied to a fleshy part of the body, such as the buttocks
Some policies allow parents the opportunity to opt out of corporal punishment of their child by signing a form at the beginning of the school year
Parents are made aware of the school's policy on discipline
Even with all the policies in place, Salter said school officials try to avoid corporal punishment.
Although parents are aware of the school's corporate punishment policy, Salter said many teachers still fear that their jobs will be in jeopardy when they are forced to implement a spanking to a student.
"If you ask teachers or administrators what they fear the most, it's lawsuits," he said. "You can be assured that teachers go out of their ways to follow the required procedure."
However, there's still a risk that something will go wrong for the teacher.
"There's sill the possibility for them to be attacked personally in either a civil or criminal suit," Salter said.
Salter said he could not recall an incident where a teacher was hit with a lawsuit, or faced the possibility that their certificate was revoked. However, if abuse of corporal punishment is suspected, local authorities, and law enforcement would be asked to investigate and prosecute if necessary.
