507 - Corporal Punishment Policy
The purpose of this policy is to describe limitation on corporal punishment of students.
General Statement of Policy
No employee or agent of the school district shall cause corporal punishment to be inflicted upon a student to reform unacceptable conduct or as a penalty for unacceptable conduct. As used in this policy, the term "corporal punishment" means conduct involving hitting or spanking a person with or without an object, or unreasonable physical force that causes bodily harm or substantial emotional harm.
A teacher or school principal may use reasonable force when it is necessary under the circumstances to correct or restrain a student or prevent bodily harm or death to another. Other school district employees, school bus drivers, or other agents of a school district may use reasonable force when necessary under the circumstances to restrain a student or prevent bodily harm or death to another.
Employees who violate the provisions of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action as appropriate. Any such disciplinary action shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with applicable statutory authority, collective bargaining agreements and school district policies. Violation of this policy may also result in civil or criminal liability for the employee.
