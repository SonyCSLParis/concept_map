Hi! This is Meghan Lynn Allen for About.com, and today we'll discuss how to create a tardy policy.
Create a Tardy Policy From the Start of the School Year
Tardiness causes disruption to learning. It's important to set a policy from the start and maintain your authority and keep to that policy throughout the semester and school year.
Get Students Involved When You Create a Tardy Policy
Get the students involved. Set out with a sample or basic tardy policy for the classroom that you use year after year as a jumping point for students in every new classroom. Your students can then creatively copy down the tardy policy, make some changes and additions with your approval, and the best and most creative tardy policy can be put right on the classroom door where every student sees it every day they enter.
Implement Your Tardy Policy in a Creative Way
And think of some creative ways to implement your tardy policy in the classroom. For example, create tardy cards for each student. Each student has a card and the teacher will mark off a slot each time they're tardy to class. And maybe they'll get one, two, three "get out of jail free" slots.
Establish Consequences as a Part of the Tardy Policy
And make sure to establish a punishment once the student reaches their allotment of tardies on their card. Perhaps it's staying after school on detention, or a referral to the office. And consider positive recognition as well. For a student with no tardies the entire semester or class year, a special prize, reward or recognition in the classroom.
Use a Quiz to Enforce a Tardy Policy
Start a quiz right when the bell rings. Students that are tardy will get a zero on that quiz. But be sure not to use the quiz as a punishment. Make students aware of when these quizzes will take place, and this will help draw attention to your tardy policy and enforce it.
Consider Different Levels of Punishment for Your Tardy Policy
Consider different levels for tardy punishment. For instance, a first tardy might be a written or verbal warning. A second, third or fourth tardy might mean you have to stay after class. And beyond that, or reaching an excess of tardies for the semester, may lead to suspension.
Try to Find a Cause for Chronic Tardiness
Try to find out if there's some underlying reason to the tardiness. Perhaps there's an issue at home or an issue of transportation. Whenever possible, be part of the solution.
