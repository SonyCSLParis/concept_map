Positive Behaviour Policy
Positive Behaviour is the system and ethos in a school which aims to cultivate in our children an acceptance of responsibility for their own decisions and behaviour and also to accept the consequences for their actions. It is normally a system of rules for good behaviour to be observed and followed by all pupils. Since discipline is about relationships between teacher and pupil and between pupil and pupil, our discipline policy accepts every child in the school as an important human person created by God and entrusted to our care by their parents. Likewise every teacher in our school is regarded as an important person, who has been entrusted with the care of these children and as such is entitled to the support and respect of parents.
AIMS OF OUR POSITIVE BEHAVIOUR POLICY
To develop a sense of self-discipline in our children which will enable them to take responsibility for their own actions.
To create the conditions for an orderly community within the school in which effective learning can take place.
To develop in our children responsible attitudes and Christian values for living.
To encourage respect for oneself by developing each child's self esteem.
To encourage respect for all other people and their property, a proper concern for the environment and the general promotion of good citizenship.
To moderate and improve behaviour both in school and in extra-curricular activities through the use of the positive approach of praise, encouragement, incentives and inducements.
To only use the more negative approach of criticism and punishments as a last resort to encourage good behaviour.
AIMS INTO PRACTICE - SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
The seven aims set out above will be best achieved within the framework of a relaxed, pleasant atmosphere in which all pupils are able to give of their best and are encouraged and stimulated to fulfil their potential both in the classroom and in any extra-curricular activities. Discipline is often considered only in the context of punishments or sanctions. It needs to be seen in the much wider framework which demands a positive policy of encouraging good attitudes, rewards and praise (where possible) and setting good example. In our school, we realise the need to put great emphasis on rewarding those pupils who behave well rather than punishing those who behave badly. Although sanctions will be used when necessary, our policy will concentrate on achieving the right framework for discipline and the right ethos in the school so that punishments and sanctions become increasingly unnecessary. Most pupils react well to praise and there is always something worthy of praise in all children.
As a Catholic school our aim will be to establish a community of prayer and worship where learning takes place in harmony. Our school must be a community of caring, of sympathy, understanding and tolerance. It must be a community which believes in the uniqueness of each individual as a cherished creation of God. In such a community there will be justice and generosity but there will also be guidelines to follow and rewards and sanctions to be given out. We will aim to establish caring and supportive relationships. It is in such a setting that children can experience dignity as persons and will come to appreciate the meaning of such virtues as honesty, truth, trust and responsibility.
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR
We in the school would see unacceptable behaviour resulting from an extensive range of factors and influences. Generally acts of indiscipline can be put into the following categories and they would be regarded as totally unacceptable.
1. BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL.
e.g. truancy, persistent lateness, not bringing notes, lack of respect for lunchtime supervisors, running in corridors, leaving school without permission, anti-social behaviour such as telling lies, cheating, stealing, spitting or rude language.
2. BETWEEN THE CHILD AND HIS/HER SCHOOLWORK OR HOMEWORK.
e.g. persistently untidy work; unfinished work; not doing homework; carelessness with work; laziness and wasting time.
3. BETWEEN PUPILS.
e.g. bullying; fighting or quarrelling; calling names; dangerous or unruly behaviour; threatening another child; telling lies about another child; refusing to share things; showing a lack of respect for another pupil; distracting other children from their work; stealing; destroying or defacing another child's books or property.
4. BETWEEN PUPIL AND TEACHER.
e.g. disobedience; disruptive behaviour in class or on out of school trips; showing insolence, rudeness in manner or language; not paying attention; time-wasting; telling lies; temper tantrums; lack of courtesy to teachers.
5. BETWEEN PUPILS AND SCHOOL PROPERTY
e.g. lack of care for or loss of, school books; lack of care for school equipment; defacing of school furniture or school buildings; destruction of school property - such as plants, trees etc.
6. BETWEEN PUPILS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY
e.g. stealing, damaging or destroying private property; bad behaviour on the street or on buses coming to or going home from school; showing a lack of respect or concern for other people and their property.
The emphasis will always be on giving encouragement and praise rather than criticism or punishments. Praise and encouragement will be given in many ways and, without any attempt to put them into a value order, will include the following:-
a quiet word of encouragement.
a written comment on the child's work pointing to the merit of the work.
a visit to another teacher/Principal for commendation or other form of reward.
a public word or praise for the child in front of the class or at assembly.
a star/points award system
public acknowledgement by presentation at assembly or by giving the child some special task or responsibility.
the giving of mark s, grades or assessments by the teacher for good behaviour as well as good work.
special certificates for a each class, with a chosen focus, presented formally at First Friday assemblies. Mother Teresa Cup for outstanding kindness and consideration for others and Headteacher Shield for outstanding work, presented monthly.
using the school reports and Records of Achievements to highlight and comment favourably not only on good work but also on positive behaviour or actions or positive attitudes.
short notes to parents informing them specifically of some action or achievement which deserves praise.
head teacher award stickers as an ongoing acknowledgement of improvement, effort or achievement.
The class teacher will have the major responsibility for disciplining children in his/her care but all teachers in the school share a corporate responsibility for the discipline of all children. Our teachers accept that they are responsible at all times for any children within sight or sound of them. Sanctions will vary according to the situation.
Teachers will use only those punishments or sanctions which are appropriate to the individual child's needs and circumstances. Whole-class sanctions or punishments will never be used. Teachers will always attempt to be fair but firm. They will be positive and any criticism used will always be constructive and include advice on how to improve behaviour or work.
The following wide range of sanctions, which are not listed in a precise value order but generally start with the less serious and end with the more serious sanctions, may be used.
Immediate checking of misbehaviour including verbal and non-verbal individual and public indications of disapproval.
Minor penalties being imposed by the teacher which are relevant to the offence if possible e.g. extra or repeating work where quality is unsatisfactory or picking up litter for a child who has littered the place.
Loss of privileges such as membership of clubs, the right to go on certain visits, exclusion from school teams and attendance at film shows etc.
Referral of child to the V. Principal or Principal who will take action and await results.
Parental Consultation will come at an early stage if and when it becomes obvious that the child's behaviour problem persists. Appropriate action may be agreed. At this stage detention may be considered for older children and used with the full agreement of the parents. (If detention is agreed the school will notify the parents and ensure that the child gets home safely).
Target book with grades for levels of behaviour, A being excellent, B satisfactory, C unsatisfactory. Where a C grade is given an agreed sanction will be given at home that evening and a follow up one at school next day. The pupil will remain on the book till behaviour has significantly improved and targets achieved.
Restitution, repair of wilful damage and/or payment for it.
In the unlikely event of no satisfactory resolution of the problem or a total lack of co-operation from the parents the school will exercise the right to suspend a pupil for a definite period under the scheme prepared by the C.C.M.S.
It is envisaged that the extreme action of permanent exclusion (expulsion) of a child from the school would rarely be necessary but this power does reside with the Board of Governors under the C.C.M.S. Scheme.
PASTORAL CARE AND ADVICE
The school has close links with the various agencies and in particular with Cathy Graham the Pastoral Care co-ordinator at Windmill Hill Clinic, Ballynahinch.
Pastoral advice and care will form a very important part of the disciplinary framework in the school and the school's Mission Statement will be central to all aspects of Pastoral care within the school. Every teacher in the school will be involved at an appropriate level. Promotion of positive behaviour is paramount so teachers will build up an understanding of and a close relationship with every child in their class. This will make the discussion of attitudes, the criticism of poor work or the admonition of bad behaviour more acceptable to the child and hopefully therefore, more effective. It will also provide an awareness of any underlying problems which children may have. All teachers recognise the absolute necessity of getting to know the pupil as an individual and becoming aware of any factors at home or in school, or perhaps health problems, which would need attention. Poor behaviour will often stem from personal problems or difficulties. To punish persistent bad behaviour and ignore the reasons for it will solve very little and is only likely to be a very short-term solution. It is important for us to look for the reasons for persistent bad behaviour from a child. The main aim of our pastoral care and advice will therefore be to encourage and openly acknowledge good behaviour rather than merely react to poor behaviour with punishments. We will also establish a close relationship with all external support services such as the Pastoral care co-ordinator, the Educational Welfare Officer, the Psychology Department of the South Eastern Education and Library Board, C.C.M.S., Social Workers, Health Visitors and School Nurse and the school chaplain, so that the background understanding of the needs of all children and the provision of the right type of support, can be achieved. Parents will be involved at the appropriate level.
EVALUATION OF THE SCHOOL'S POLICY
The degree of success in achieving our aims will best be judged by the following:-
The sense of orderliness apparent to onlookers as children move about the school.
The sense of order which is evident day and daily in the formal teaching situation in an orderly environment where effective learning is taking place.
The degree of respect and consideration for others which is shown by all concerned in the school.
The obvious good manners exhibited by the children.
The positive attitudes to the teacher, and to the class work and homework given.
The progressive development of self-discipline, initiative and self-reliance in our children.
The care exercised for school books and equipment, the fabric of the building and the wider environment outside the school.
The children's pride in their own personal appearance and cleanliness and the level of a child's self-esteem.
The respect in which the school is held by parents and the wider community.
Clearly for our school's positive behaviour policy to be successful it must be fully accepted and understood by parents and children and consistently and fairly applied by the teachers. It must also be seen as reasonable, sensitive and effective and must be based upon mutual respect for the needs and aspirations of all in the school. The full support of parents and the close co-operation between parents and the teachers is vital in the whole process.
