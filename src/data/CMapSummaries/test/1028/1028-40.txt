Program Descriptions for Parents/Families
This is a list of evidence-based programs targeting families. These programs are all designed to help children and youth succeed through strengthening families, by improving positive parenting skills, building effective family management, and increasing positive family communication. In general, the programs aim to improve youths' success in school and with friends, and to reduce problematic behaviors such as aggression, defiance, substance use, risky sexual behavior, and delinquency. The list of programs is divided into those that primarily target young children and school-age children, those targeting preteens and young teens, and those targeting troubled teens.
Programs for families of young children and school-aged children
The Triple P Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is a multi-level system of parenting supports that takes a public health approach to supporting parents in effective parenting strategies. Triple P offers a variety of levels of parenting support depending on family need, ranging from media about parenting strategies targeted at all parents (Level 1) to group-based or self-directed parent training programs for families who need greater support (Level 4) to intensive and individualized treatment for families who need the highest level of intensive supports (Level 5). Different versions of the program are available for different target populations (e.g. parents of disabled children, parents of autistic children, parents at risk of maltreatment) and for different aged children (2 - 10 year olds, teens). Numerous controlled experiments as well as meta-analyses have demonstrated positive effects of each level of Triple P on child behavior, parenting skill, parental adjustment, and the parent-child relationship. A recent large-scale population trial (Prinz, Sanders, Shapiro, Whitaker, &amp; Lutzker, in press ) randomized counties to receive either services as usual or the entire 5-level Triple P system; the counties that received Triple P showed lower rates of child out-of-home placements, substantiated child maltreatment, and hospitalizations or emergency room visits caused by child maltreatment injuries.

Parent Management Training-the Oregon Model (PMTO) is a parent-focused program for individual families that teaches parenting skills to parents of 4- through 12-year-olds who are exhibiting behavior problems. This evidence-based, structured training lasts 12 to 20 weeks on average. Through meetings with individual families, parents are taught encouragement of positive behavior, effective and consistent handling of problem behaviors, monitoring, problem-solving, positive involvement, and communication. A recent study found that participation in PMTO resulted in reduced delinquency and problem behavior in children, and reduced depression and more effective parenting in mothers (Forgatch, Beldavs, Patterson, &amp; DeGarmo, 2008).

The Incredible Years is a 3-part family-, teacher-, and child-focused program for children between the ages of 2 and 10 with behavior problems. The primary component of the Incredible Years, the parent-focused group-based program, teaches parenting skills in a group setting, using video-based examplars and group discussion. The focus is on building parents' skills in encouraging positive behaviors, being positively involved with their children, and in effectively and consistently handling problem behaviors. Participants meet for two hours per week for 12 to 14 weeks. The teacher-focused program provides training in classroom behavior management and the child-focused program teaches anger management, problem-solving, and social skills. Experimental evaluations of the parenting program have shown that participating mothers become more positive, less critical, more consistent, and more competent in their parenting than mothers who did not complete the program, and their children exhibit fewer behavior problems than children whose parents did not attend the program (Reid, Webster-Stratton, &amp; Beauchaine, 2001).

Programs for families of preteens and young teens
The Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP) , also known as EcoFIT (or Ecological Approach to Family Intervention and Treatment) , is a multilevel parent training program for families of young adolescents (ages 11 through 15), designed to be implemented in middle schools. The model consists of three levels: (1) a parent consultant and Family Resource Center (FRC) based at the school to provide general parenting support to all parents, including brief consultations, feedback to parents on their children's behavior, and access to written resources; (2) the Family Check-Up (FCU), a brief three-session intervention for families of at-risk youth that clarifies family strengths and areas for improvement and motivates family goals for change; and (3) more intensive, personalized supports for those who need high levels of support. Compared to randomized controls, adolescents whose parents engaged in the FCU showed less growth in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use, and problem behavior during ages 11 through 17, along with decreased risk for substance use diagnoses and police records of arrests by age 18(Connell, Dishion, Yasui, &amp; Kavanagh, 2007). The program website offers complete information about the program:  ( http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~cfc/atp.htm ).

Strengthening Families for Parents and Youth 10 - 14 (SFP 10-14) aims to reduce family-related risk factors for adolescent problems and to build protective factors in early adolescents and their families. SFP 10-14 offers seven weekly, group-based, two-hour sessions for parents (or caregivers) to learn parenting skills and for the children (10 to 14 years old) to develop problem-solving skills. Four additional booster sessions take place after the seven sessions have ended. A long-term experimental evaluation (Hill &amp; Parker, 2005) showed that, four years after the program, youth who attended SFP 10-14 with their families were significantly less likely to have started using alcohol and tobacco and were less aggressive than youth in the control group. Families who attended SFP 10-14 reported significant increases in family cohesion.

Families That Care: Guiding Good Choices (FTC: GGC) is a parenting group program for parents of 4th through 8th graders designed to promote family bonding and communication, provide knowledge and skills to parents to help them successfully navigate adolescence, and teach strategies to parents for helping their children resist using drugs. After a 2003 revision and enhancement, the program (formerly known as Preparing for the Drug-Free Years ) now offers additional family activities and exercises. GGC involves five 2-hour parenting group sessions held over five consecutive weeks, although it may alternatively consist of 10 1-hour sessions. Children attend at least one of the parenting sessions. A four-year follow-up study (Park et al., 2000) found that, when families who participated in the program were compared to families who did not participate in the program, the GCC program reduced children's current alcohol use by 41% and significantly reduced initiation rates for using marijuana and getting drunk.

Programs for families of troubled teens
Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) is a family therapy program designed for families with youth between the ages of 6 and 17 who are exhibiting behavior problems and/or are at risk for drug abuse. Over a 12- to 20-week period, in individual family-focused 1.5-hour sessions, BSFT teaches families how to overcome individual and family risk factors through focused interventions to improve communication among family members and to strengthen the family unit. An experimental evaluation of the program found that BSFT significantly reduced conduct disorders among teens whose families had received BSFT, compared to those who did not receive the program, as well as reduced drug use among 60% of the teens who had been smoking marijuana at the start of the program (Santisteban et al., 2003). The BSFT website at http://www.brief-strategic-family-therapy.com/bsft offers complete information about the program.

Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) places court-ordered youth (e.g., with chronic antisocial behavior, emotional disturbance, or delinquency) in homes with foster parents who have received extensive training in behavior management and who continue to receive support from MTFC program staff. The program includes daily monitoring of the youth's behavior, consistent consequences (even for small infractions), and positive reinforcement for positive progress. Another important feature of the program is separating the teens from delinquent peers. Before the adolescents return home, their parents have received the same training and support as the foster parents received. Rigorous scientific evaluations of the program have found fewer arrests, less crime, less delinquent behavior, less incarceration, and better school attendance among the teens who participated in MTFC than those in regular community placements (Chamberlain &amp; Smith, 2003).

Multisystemic Therapy (MST) offers intensive family- and community-based treatment to the families of chronic juvenile offenders and drug abusers ages 10 to 17, and to the youth themselves. The program is designed to make positive changes in the social systems that contribute to the serious multiple problem behaviors of those who are at risk for out-of-home placement (e.g., foster care, correctional facilities, hospitals, group homes, etc.). This intensive family-based assistance is available seven days per week, 24 hours per day for 16 to 20 weeks. The program offers intensive family therapy and referral and works with the parents and youth on issues related to family, school, peers, and community context, to provide the youth with firm structure and supervision, enforce clear rules, prevent associations with problematic peers, and teach and reinforce positive behaviors. A fourteen-year follow-up study (Schaeffer &amp; Borduin, 2005) found long-term treatment effects: Compared to randomized controls, those who had received the program 14 years earlier had significantly fewer re-arrests and lower rates of substance abuse. The MST website offers comprehensive information about the program ( http://www.mstservices.com/index.php ).

Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is an empirically grounded family intervention for juvenile offenders between the ages of 10 and 18. Family-based sessions last from 12 to 20 weeks and are offered in several environments (e.g., schools, child welfare, probation, parole/aftercare, mental health, and as an alternative to incarceration or out-of-home placement). Targeted problems include conduct disorder, violent acting-out, and substance abuse. Depending on seriousness and need, the intervention can last from 8 to 12 one-hour sessions to as much as 30 sessions. The treatment is organized in phases, each of which has specific goals, assessment foci, and intervention techniques; this helps clinicians remain focused on treatment goals amidst considerable family and individual disruption. A summary of several evaluations (Alexander, Pugh, Parson, &amp; Sexton, 2000) indicates that, in general, families who participated in the program showed significant improvements in positive communication, family interactions, and parent involvement, and reduced maternal depression, adolescent anxiety, and re-arrest rates.
