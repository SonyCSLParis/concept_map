All Stars™ All Stars™ is a school- or community-based program designed to delay the onset of or prevent high-risk behaviors in middle school-age adolescents, 11 to 14 years old. It affects youth substance use, violence, and premature sexual activity by fostering development of positive personal characteristics. A highly interactive program, All Stars involves 9 to 13 lessons during its first year and 7 to 8 booster lessons in its second year.
All Stars is based on strong research that has identified the critical factors that lead young people to begin experimenting with substances and participating in other high-risk behaviors. The program is designed to reinforce positive qualities typical of youth at this age; it works to strengthen five specific qualities vital to achieving preventive effects:
Developing positive ideals and future aspirations
Establishing positive norms
Building strong personal commitments
Promoting bonding with school and community organizations
Promoting positive parental attentiveness
CCP Part I and II CCP Part I is designed for communities seeking to form or strengthen coalitions to work on environmental strategies to prevent underage alcohol use and to develop strategic plans for tactics to accomplish objectives.  Organizing for environmental policy change requires very different structure from the usual prevention coalitions.  Participants will learn how to engage and retain effective advocates.  Understanding preemption and governmental procedures, the most current research on environmental strategies, and strategic campaign development are included components.
CCP Part II will be hands-on skill building for successful implementation of strategic plans.  Media advocacy skills training will focus on specific environmental policy campaigns.  Where feasible, a live media event will be conducted as part of the training.  Tactics for enhancing relationships with key policy makers will be developed and role-played.  Incremental steps to build community-wide support for policy objectives will be outlined.
Part I and Part II are each approximately one-day trainings.  They may be scheduled consecutively or at separate times.  TST staff will accommodate the coalition's timeframe to complete the components of each training.  Each training will be framed in the context of the coalitions' specific objectives.
Creating Lasting Family Connections Creating Lasting Family Connections (CLFC) is a comprehensive family strengthening, substance abuse, and violence prevention curriculum. CLFC has demonstrated that youth and families in high-risk environments can be assisted to become strong, healthy, and supportive people. Program results, documented with children 11 to 15 years old, have shown significant increases in children's resistance to the onset of substance use and reduction in use of alcohol and drugs.
CLFC provides parents and children with strong defenses against environmental risk factors by teaching appropriate skills for personal growth, family enhancement, and interpersonal communication, including refusal skills for both parents and youth.
Proven Results
Delayed onset of substance use for participating youth
Decreased use of substances among participating youth
Increased parents' knowledge and appropriate beliefs about substance use
Increased parental involvement in setting rules about substance use
Dando Fuerza a la Familia The Spanish version of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP) involves elementary school-aged children (6 to 12 years old) and their families in family skills training sessions. SFP uses family systems and cognitive-behavioral approaches to increase resilience and reduce risk factors for behavioral, emotional, academic, and social problems. It builds on protective factors by:
Improving family relationships
Improving parenting skills
Increasing the youth's social and life skills
SFP offers incentives for attendance, good behavior in children, and homework completion to increase program recruitment and participation.
Proven Results
Improves resilience, assets, and protective factors in children and parents
Decreases risk factors in parents and children
Decreases children's behavioral problems and conduct disorders
Improves family cohesion, communication, and organization
Decreases family conflict and stress
(FAST) Families and Schools Together: Building Relationships (Elementary and Middle School) Families and Schools Together (FAST) is a multifamily group intervention designed to build protective factors and reduce the risk factors associated with substance abuse and related problem behaviors for children 4 to12 years old and their parents.  FAST systematically applies research on family stress theory, family systems theory, social ecological theory, and community development strategies to achieve its four goals:
Enhanced family functioning
Prevention of school failure by the targeted child
Prevention of substance abuse by the child and other family members
Reduced stress from daily life situations for parents and children
One of the primary strategies of FAST is parent empowerment: parents receive support to be the primary prevention agents for their own children. Entire families participate in program activities that are designed to build parental respect in children, improve intrafamily bonds, and enhance the family-school relationship. FAST activities were developed to build the social capital of parents and provide a safe place to practice parenting. As a result of this program, the participating children increase their social skills and attention span, while reducing their anxiety and aggression. Research has shown that these childhood behavioral outcomes are correlated in adolescence to the prevention of substance abuse, delinquency, and school failure.
Keepin' It REAL (KIR) The keepin' it REAL (Refuse, Explain, Avoid, Leave) program is a video-enhanced intervention that uses a culturally-grounded resiliency model which incorporates traditional ethnic values and practices that protect against drug use. A school-based prevention program for elementary, middle, and early high school students 10 through 17 years of age, keepin' it REAL is based on previous work that demonstrates that teaching communication and life skills can combat negative peer and other influences. keepin' it REAL extends resistance and life-skills models by using a culturally-based narrative and performance framework to:
Enhance anti-drug norms and attitudes
Facilitate the development of risk assessment, decision-making, and resistance skills
Keepin' it REAL utilizes a 10-lesson classroom curriculum accompanied by a collection of five videos that demonstrate resistance strategies and illustrate the skills taught in the lessons.
Kid's Connection/Rainbow Days Rainbow Days' Kids' Connection Support Group Facilitator Training provides participants with the information and skills necessary to be a support group facilitator of Kids' Connection, one of Rainbow Days' award winning curriculum-based support group (CBSG) programs for children and youth.  Kids' Connection reduces risk factors for substance abuse and enhances protective factors among selective populations of youth.  It was developed specifically to fill a gap in the prevention continuum by providing substance abuse education using an "educational support group" process designed specifically for selective populations of youth ages 4-12.
Members are grouped developmentally, with group size limited to 6 to 12 members, depending on age and development.  The program is 10 sessions and the session duration is 30 minutes (ages 4-6) to one hour (ages 6-12.)  Groups are held in private settings and are "closed" with regard to membership.  Group rules provide for confidentiality and encourage introspection.  Kids' Connection can be implemented in school and/or community-based settings.
Life Skills™ Training (Elementary and Middle School) LifeSkills Training is a program that seeks to influence major social and psychological factors that promote the initiation and early use of substances. LifeSkills has distinct elementary (8 to 11 years old) and middle school (11 to 14 years old) curricula that are delivered in a series of classroom sessions over 3 years. The sessions use lecture, discussion, coaching, and practice to enhance students' self-esteem, feelings of self-efficacy, ability to make decisions, and ability to resist peer and media pressure.
LifeSkills consists of three major components that address critical domains found to promote substance use. Research has shown that students who develop skills in these three domains are far less likely to engage in a wide range of high-risk behaviors.  The three components each focus on a different set of skills:
Drug Resistance Skills enable young people to recognize and challenge common misconceptions about substance use, as well as deal with peers and media pressure to engage in substance use.
Personal Self-Management Skills help students to examine their self-image and its effects on behavior, set goals and keep track of personal progress, identify everyday decisions and how they may be influenced by others, analyze problem situations, and consider the consequences of alternative solutions before making decisions.
General Social Skills give students the necessary skills to overcome shyness, communicate effectively and avoid misunderstandings, use both verbal and nonverbal assertiveness skills to make or refuse requests, and recognize that they have choices other than aggression or passivity when faced with tough situations.

(PATHS) Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) is a comprehensive program for promoting emotional and social competencies and reducing aggression and acting-out behaviors in elementary-school-aged children, while simultaneously enhancing the educational process in the classroom. This innovative curriculum for kindergarten through sixth grade (ages 5 to 12), is used by educators and counselors as a multiyear, prevention model.
The PATHS curriculum provides teachers with systematic and developmentally based lessons, materials, and instructions for teaching their students:
Emotional literacy
Social competence
Positive peer relations
Interpersonal problem-solving skills
The PATHS curriculum has been shown to improve protective factors and reduce behavioral risk factors.

Although primarily focused on school and classroom settings, information and activities are also included for use with parents.
Peers Making Peace Peers Making Peace (PMP) is a peer-mediation program developed to help create and maintain safe and drug free schools by equipping students with attitudes and skills to stay drug-free, stay in school and avoid violence by resolving conflicts in a peaceful, prosocial manner. The goal of the program is to improve the school environment by reducing violence, assaults, discipline referrals, and increasing academic performance. In the PMP intervention, teams of student volunteers are trained to serve as drug free role models and "neutral third parties" to provide mediation services for their peers who lack the skills to successfully resolve their conflicts. The program is based on two parallel philosophical foundations: a strong "no use" message, and the "resiliency and protective factor" approach to prevention.
Positive Action The Positive Action (PA) program is an integrated, comprehensive, and coherent program that has been shown to improve academic achievement and multiple behaviors of children and adolescents (5 to 18 years old) and their parents and teachers. It is intensive, with lessons at each grade level (from kindergarten to 12th) that are reinforced all day by including school, family, and community components, which work together or can stand alone.

Project ALERT Project ALERT is a drug prevention curriculum for middle school students 11 to14 years old, which dramatically reduces both the onset of substance abuse and their regular use. The 2-year, 14-lesson program focuses on the substances that adolescents are most likely to use: alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and inhalants. Project ALERT use participatory activities and videos to help:
Motivate adolescents against drug use
Teach adolescents the skills and strategies needed to resist prodrug pressures
Establish nondrug-using norms
Guided classroom discussions and small group activities stimulate peer interaction and challenge student beliefs and perceptions, while intensive role-playing activities help students learn and master resistance skills. Homework assignments that also involve parents extend the learning process by facilitating parent-child discussions of drugs and how to resist using them. These lessons are reinforced through videos that model appropriate behavior.
Project Northland Project Northland is a multilevel, multiyear program proven to delay the age at which young people begin drinking, to reduce alcohol use among those who have already tried drinking, and to limit the number of alcohol-related problems of young drinkers. Designed for sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students (10 to14 years old), Project Northland addresses both individual behavioral change and environmental change. Project Northland also strives to change how parents communicate with their children, how peers influence each other, and how communities respond to young adolescent alcohol use. Components include:
Parent involvement
Behavioral curricula
Peer-led small group activities
Strategies to reduce access to alcohol
Each intervention year has an overall theme and is tailored to the developmental level of the young adolescent. Alcohol is the focus of the Project Northland program because it is American teenagers' drug of choice and inflicts the greatest harm among youth.
