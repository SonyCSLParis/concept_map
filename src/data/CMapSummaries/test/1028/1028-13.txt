When parents are involved, students achieve more, regardless of socio-economic status, ethnic/racial background, or the parents' education level.
The more extensive the parent involvement, the higher the student achievement.
When parents are involved in their students' education, those students have higher grades and test scores, better attendance, and complete homework more consistently.
When parents are involved, students exhibit more positive attitudes and behavior.
Students whose parents are involved in their lives have higher graduation rates and greater enrollment rates in post-secondary education.
Different types of parent/family involvement produce different gains. To have long-lasting gains for students, parent involvement activities must be well-planned, inclusive, and comprehensive.
Educators hold higher expectations of students whose parents collaborate with the teacher. They also hold higher opinions of those parents.
In programs that are designed to involve parents in full partnerships, student achievement for disadvantaged children not only improves, it can reach levels that are standard for middle-class children. In addition, the children who are farthest behind make the greatest gains.
Children from diverse cultural backgrounds tend to do better when parents and professionals collaborate to bridge the gap between the culture at home and the learning institution.
Student behaviors, such as alcohol use, violence, and antisocial behavior decrease as parent involvement increases.
Students are more likely to fall behind in academic performance if their parents do not participate in school events, develop a working relationship with their child's educators, or keep up with what is happening in their child's school.
The benefits of involving parents are not confined to the early years; there are significant gains at all ages and grade levels.
Junior and senior high school students whose parents remain involved, make better transitions, maintain the quality of their work, and develop realistic plans for their future. Students whose parents are not involved, on the other hand, are more likely to drop out of school.
The most accurate predictor of a student's achievement in school is not income or social status, but the extent to which that student's family is able to (1) create a home environment that encourages learning; (2) communicate high, yet reasonable, expectations for their children's achievement and future careers; and (3) become involved in their children's education at school and in the community.
