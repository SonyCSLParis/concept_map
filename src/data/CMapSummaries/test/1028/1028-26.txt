Most of what we know about parental alcohol use and its influence on adolescent alcohol and drug use is based upon studies of paternal alcohol use. Prior to coming to PRC in June 0f 2002, a five year study was undertaken to explore the relationships between maternal behaviors (specifically alcohol use, punitive and protective behaviors) and adolescents' symptoms of trauma and their alcohol use. This study was done in connection with colleagues in Buffalo, Dr. Nancy Smyth and Dr. Gene Maguin. Interview data from 499 mother and child pairs were collected at three different points in time, approximately six months apart for each data wave. Women who had at least one child between the ages of 10 and 16 and living with them were identified to form the following three groups: 1) Heavy Drinkers in Treatment (n =84), 2) Community Heavy Drinkers (n=175), and Community Low Alcohol or Drug (AOD) group (n=240). One child (randomly chosen) was selected for participation to create a mother-child pair for the study. Our study examined protective behaviors related to maternal monitoring, such as knowing the whereabouts of your child, having rules and limits, exhibiting connecting and caring towards the child. Punitive behaviors included measures of maternal psychological aggression and moderate levels of physical violence. Adolescent symptoms of trauma included symptoms of anger, depression, and anxiety. Both mothers and adolescents were assessed for the involvement in alcohol and other drugs.
Mothers who used alcohol reported employing significantly higher levels of punitive behaviors and less protective behaviors toward their children. Thus all of mothers' behaviors were related to each other. However, mothers' behaviors impacted children's behaviors differently. Mothers' alcohol involvement did not impact children's levels of trauma nor children's alcohol and drug use. In contrast, mothers' punitive behavior increased children's level of trauma and children's alcohol and drug use. Mothers' protective behavior decreased some of the indicators of children's trauma and children's alcohol and drug use.
To explore further how maternal behavior may be related to other patterns of adolescent alcohol and drug use, we then explored whether maternal alcohol involvement was related to children's expectancies about alcohol use. Expectancies related to alcohol impacting social behavior at time one, related to children's alcohol involvement at time two. Further Mothers' alcohol use and monitoring were negatively related to children's expectancies about alcohol enhancing social behavior. Thus, once again, maternal alcohol use did not have a detrimental effect on adolescents alcohol and drug use, even indirectly through the influence on children's expectancies about alcohol use.
Our work continues to explore the relationships between parental behaviors and children's alcohol and other drug problems. In studies planned at PRC, we will continue to explore the actual parenting behaviors that contribute to keeping adolescents free from alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. In addition, work is continuing on the exploration of family-based models of intervention and linking these family-based interventions to environmental approaches for reducing alcohol and drug use. The accessibility and the contextual support for adolescent alcohol and drug use continue to provide important areas for addressing through prevention programs. The extent to which the family can provide support to adolescents for maintaining alcohol and drug free lives remain important as part of our strategies for youth.
