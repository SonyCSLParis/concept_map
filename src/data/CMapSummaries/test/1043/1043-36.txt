Early Literacy is what children know about reading before they know how to read. Children begin to acquire language skills long before they are able to read. The lessons children learn early on help to make them better readers as they grow. Early literacy guides offer simple tips on how to help children grow into strong readers, as well as book suggestions, and tips for making the most of reading time with your child.
