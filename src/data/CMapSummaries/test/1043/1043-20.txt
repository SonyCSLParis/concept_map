Early Literacy
Early Literacy is what children know about reading and writing before they can actually do it themselves. From the earliest experiences; babies chewing on books to your preschooler "writing" a grocery list for you, all literacy interactions are important. Parents and Caregivers - you are your child's first teacher.
You can help your child learn those important skills now so that they will be successful in school, and later in life. You can also lay the groundwork to show them that learning can be FUN! Don't worry about flash cards and programs. Instead, have some fun with your child and engage in activities that are fun, natural and relaxed like playing games, singing songs and telling stories. Your child will grow up associating pleasure with learning.
Researchers agree that children are more likely to become good readers if they start school with three sets of accomplishments:
Oral language skills and phonological awareness: Children are able to comprehend and to express themselves with a wide range of words. They are able to distinguish the sounds as well as the meaning of words.
Print awareness and letter knowledge: Children have learned that the black and white marks on a page represent spoken words. They are able to name the letters of the alphabet.
Motivation to learn and appreciation for literary forms: Children have been exposed to a wide variety of literary experiences and have learned to love books and stories.

Raising a reader
Begin when your child is born and spend time reading every day.
Sing to your baby.
Repeat nursery rhymes.
Visit the library. Ask about storytimes. Borrow books to share with your baby at home.
Choose books with colorful pictures and simple words--or no words at all.
Read with expression--or just tell the story in your own words.
Hold the book so your child can see the pictures clearly.
Let your baby play with the book.
Encourage your toddler to point out objects, repeat words, and talk about the story.
Reread your child's favorite books over and over again.
Use the technique of dialogic reading to help a child stay actively involved with a story and develop reading comprehension. Instead of reading the story straight through, ask the child open-ended questions about the story: "Why do you think Goldilocks ate Baby Bear's porridge?" "What do you think will happen next?"
Read or tell stories in the language you are most comfortable with. It doesn't have to be English!
Help your child develop phonological awareness --the understanding that words are made up of smaller sounds--by playing games with the sounds of words and repeating rhymes.
Tell stories about your family and your culture.
Encourage older children to read to their younger brothers and sisters.
Be an example to your children; let them see you read books too.
More tips for book sharing
Set aside a special time each day, such as nap time, bedtime, or after meals.
Share books when you and your child are both in a relaxed mood.
Take advantage of "waiting" times to share books--on trips, at the doctor's office, in line at the grocery store.
Reading even 5 or 10 minutes a day to young children helps them get ready to read on their own.

The world lost a revered author of children's literature when Russell Hoban passed away last Tueday at the age of 86. Although he wrote more than 50 books for children and was the author of several popular adult novels, here in the children's library he is best known for his Frances books. Bread and Jam for Frances remains one of the definitive books about picky eaters, and the entire series is worth revisiting for its gentle, funny look at the life of a young badger.

Librarian-Selected Apps for Early Literacy iPad Kits
The Children's Library is now circulating six new Early Literacy iPads .  The kits come pre-loaded with selected apps geared towards children ages 2 to 5.  The apps were specially selected for their early literacy skill-building qualities.  As we discover great new apps, we will update the iPad kits periodically.  In the meantime, here is the current list of apps you will find installed on Darien Library's Early Literacy iPads:
ABC Pocket Phonics : a simply-designed app that reinforces letter knowledge. Children are encouraged to trace letter shapes and repeat the sounds.
Goosed-Up Rhymes : Not only will these Mother Goose nursery rhymes help young children develop phonological awareness, a key early literacy skill, but they are hilarious and entertaining for grown-ups, too.
Head2Toes : Rosemary Wells created the featured bunny in this entertaining, multilingual app. Children can sing along to Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes in English, French, Spanish, and Japanese.
Cat in the Hat : Dr. Seuss' classic book is brought to life in this interactive app that reinforces print awareness and vocabulary-building.
eliasMATCH : A well-designed app that boosts memory and thinking skills, while also developing letter knowledge, number recognition, and vocabulary.
eliasPAINTS : A fun coloring app that inspires creativity. Children can choose from animal, alphabet, number, or object coloring pages.
PopOut! Peter Rabbit : One of our very favorite book-based apps. Children can listen to the narrator read this classic tale while also engaging with the interactive pop-up style illustrations.
Sorting : Early literacy skills are about more than just letters and words. This simple sorting and pattern-matching app encourages the development of basic mathematical and critical-thinking skills.
Moo Baa La La La : A hilarious iPad adaptation of the best-selling board book by author/illustrator Sandra Boynton. Children can read or be read to while learning animal sounds, and discovering hidden interactive features in this barnyard romp.
3 Little Pigs : A highly readable version of the classic tale that is also entertaining and interactive. Blow into the microphone to help the Big Bad Wolf blow down the pigs' houses. Great fun!
Nursery Rhyme with Storytime : Classic rhymes like Jack and Jill and Three Blind Mice come to life in this highly interactive, music-filled app that supports phonological awareness and helps build hand-eye coordination.
According to a new study in Early Childhood Research Quarterly , it can!  Researchers found that toddlers who possess a spoken vocabulary at 24 months show an increased ability to later on control their emotions and self-regulate.  The rationale behind the findings is that children who have the ability to verbalize their frustrations are able to more effectively control their own behavior.
And what time-tested method have parents and caregivers used for generations to help babies and toddlers begin to develop language skills? Reading aloud! So, stop by our Children's Library and pick up some Tantrum Stoppers... ahem.... that is, books.

"My daughter's teacher just informed us that Katie is between a I and a K. How to I find books at her reading level?"
"Where do you keep your C books?"
These are questions that we children's librarians are asked almost every week.  Parents, caregivers, and children will frequently come to us with a Leveled Reading list or instructions from their teachers to find books on the Guided Reading scale (this method of reading instruction, also known as the Fountas and Pinnell system, uses a scale from A to Z to indicate increasing levels of book difficulty.)
Since public libraries are organized and arranged to facilitate browsing, searching, and to inspire a lifelong love of reading, you won't find our Children's Library organized by the A to Z levels. So, how do you locate books that are appropriate for your child's reading level?
Here are a few ways to find great books for your child:
1. Ask a Children's Librarian.
We pride ourselves on knowing great children's literature and enjoy making recommendations. We will usually begin by asking you or your child what kinds of books you've read recently and whether those books felt "just right" or not. We can help you find similar titles, ones that are a little harder, or a little easier.
For children just learning to read on their own, a great place to browse is in our F5 Learn to Read area.  These books, also known as beginning readers, are designed to help newly emerging readers recognize common vocabulary, anticipate rhyming words, construct meaning through carefully placed illustrations, and build confidence.
For children who are reading independently but not quite ready to delve into Harry Potte r, check out our Kids I Read section.  Filled with popular chapter book series, these books help keep new readers engaged but not overwhelmed.
3. Use the Five Finger Rule.
What is a level H or K or D anyway? What does it mean? It can be frustrating for both parents and children to locate books on their assigned Guided Reading level. Oftentimes, the Guided Reading lists given to parents contain titles that are out of print or unavailable.
One simple and effective way to judge whether any given book is too hard or too easy is The Five Finger Rule .  Here's how it works:
- Ask your child to start reading a page from the book. Anytime they come to a word that they cannot pronounce or don't understand, hold up a finger.
- One finger means the book in question is probably too easy.
- Four or five fingers means the book in question is probably too hard.
- Two or three fingers means the book is probably JUST RIGHT .

If your child is just starting to read, sounding out words, or ready to venture into reading whole sentences, the F5 Learn to Read section is a great place to find easy reader books (also known as beginning chapter books.)
Some easy reader series focus on phonics and sight words (like the popular Bob Book kits), while others are simply great stories told with recognizable vocabulary, ample white space, and limited text.  For new readers, there are tons of excellent choices in a broad range of reading levels.  Stop by the Children's Library anytime and ask us for recommendations for your new reader.
