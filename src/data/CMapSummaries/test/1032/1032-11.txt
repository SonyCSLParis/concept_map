Brief Description
The information in this program outline is provided by the program representative and edited by the CEBC staff. The Cool Kids program has been rated by the CEBC in the area of: Anxiety Treatment (Child &amp; Adolescent) .
Types of Maltreatment: Does not target any specific kind of maltreatment
Target Population: Children and adolescents suffering anxiety disorders
Cool Kids is a program that teaches children and their parents how to better manage the child's anxiety. It can be run either individually or in groups and involves the participation of both children and their parents. The program aims to teach clear and practical skills to both the child and parents. The program is aimed at young people 7-17 years, is fully supported by manuals, and has slightly different versions for children and teenagers. Variations of the program also exist for children with comorbid autism, adolescents with comorbid depression, and for delivery in school settings.
The goals of Cool Kids are to reduce the symptoms and amount of life interference caused by anxiety, including reducing avoidance and family distress and increasing confidence, peer relationships, and engagement in extra-curricular activities.
Essential Components
The essential components of Cool Kids include:
Psychoeducation: Including understanding of the components, presentation and nature of anxiety as well as factors involved in its development. Understanding of the relevant components to treatment and their purpose.
Cognitive restructuring: Including learning to act like a detective and gather evidence about whether feared events are really highly likely.
Parent skills: Including helping parents to manage their anxious child better and reducing their urge to control and overprotect. Also teaching parents strategies to help manage their own anxious feelings.
In-vivo exposure: Including the development of stepladders for the child that allows them to gradually face their fears and learn that feared events are unlikely to happen and that they can cope.
Social skills: Including how to act in a more skilled manner and engage better with people and to act more assertively with peers.
Improved coping strategies: Including dealing more effectively with teasing and bullying, developing a range of coping strategies such as relaxation and reducing poor coping such as drug-taking, and problem solving.
Child Component
Cool Kids was designed with a child component that addresses the following presenting problems and symptoms:
Anxiety disorders of any type including separation anxiety, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Co-existing disorders are acceptable as long as anxiety is the primary problem.
Age range: 7 - 17
Developmental Delays:
This program was developed for children with developmental delays, and has been tested for children with developmental delays.

Treatment Involves Family/Support Structures:
This program involves the family or other support systems in the individual's treatment: For children under 12, parents attend every session. For adolescents, parents attend most sessions. Parents learn how to manage children differently, how to manage their own anxieties, and how to help their child implement their new skills outside the therapy sessions.
Parent / Caregiver Component
Cool Kids was not designed with a parent/caregiver component.
Group Format
Cool Kids was designed to be conducted in a group setting, and has been tested for use in a group setting.

Type of Study: Pretest-posttest control group design Number of Participants: 95
Age range - 7 to 16 years
Race/Ethnicity - Caucasian
Gender - 39 Males, 56 Females
Status - Participants were parents and children with anxiety disorders who presented following media publicity about child anxiety, referral from general practitioners and school counselors, or word of mouth communication about the program.
Location / Institution: Macquarie University Child and Adolescent Anxiety Clinic
Summary: (To include comparison groups, outcomes, measures, notable limitations) The study evaluated the outcomes from a nine-session group treatment based on the Cool Kids model for children with anxiety disorders. Parents and children completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-CP) and the self-reported Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Fear Survey Schedule - Revised (FSSC-R), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) , Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. The results from active treatment are compared with a waitlisted group assessed at pretreatment and posttreatment only. Results indicated that children in the intervention group improved significantly more on several measures of anxiety than did waiting-list controls. The improvements maintained and, in several cases increased, at 1-year follow-up. Limitations include the lack of randomization to the intervention and control groups.
Length of post-intervention follow-up: 1 year.

Status - Participants were parents with children diagnosed with anxiety disorders who were referred through school counselors, general practitioners, or mental health professionals.
Location / Institution: Macquarie University Anxiety Research Unit
Summary: (To include comparison groups, outcomes, measures, notable limitations) The study examined the impact of a 12-week trial of Cool Kids Outreach (bibliotherapy materials based on the Cool Kids anxiety program) for parents of children with anxiety disorders. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: group treatment ( Cool Kids ), bibliotherapy (Cool Kids Outreach), and to waitlist. Children completed the following measures at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up: the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children and Parents (ADIS-CP), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS), and parents completed the parent version of the SCAS and the  Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results indicated that Cool Kids Outreach demonstrated benefit for children relative to waitlist, but was not as efficacious as standard Cool Kids group treatment. Relative to waitlist, use of written materials for parents with no therapist contact resulted in around 15% more children being free of an anxiety disorder diagnosis after 12 and 24 weeks. Children in all three groups reported significant and marked change over time, but differences between groups were not significant. Limitations included reliance on semi-structured interviews and parent-completed questionnaires as outcome measures.
Length of post-intervention follow-up: 3 months.

Type of Study: Pretest-posttest control group design Number of Participants: 47
Age range - 8 to 13 years
Race/Ethnicity - Caucasian
Gender - 35 Males, 12 Females
Status - Participants were children with anxiety disorders and co-morbid autism spectrum disorders who were referred through their parents, community health centers, mental health professionals, or medical practitioners.
Location / Institution: Annie's Center and Macquarie University
Summary: (To include comparison groups, outcomes, measures, notable limitations) The study examined the effectiveness of a treatment intervention for children with co-morbid anxiety and highly functioning autism spectrum disorders based on the Cool Kids model. Participants were randomized to one of four 12-session intervention groups or a waitlist control for a period of 7 months. Parents and children participated pre- and post-treatment in completing the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-CP) and the self-reported Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) . Results indicated that the active treatment condition produced signiﬁcant change in the dependent variables in contrast to the waitlist control condition. Major limitations included relatively small sample size and diagnostic status was not formally assessed.
Length of post-intervention follow-up: None.

Cognitive behavioral treatment versus an active control for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders: A randomized trial. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 48 (5), 533-544.
Status - Participants were parents and children with a principal anxiety disorder not including depressive symptoms.
Location / Institution: Center for Emotional Health, Department of Psychology, Macquarie University.
Summary: (To include comparison groups, outcomes, measures, notable limitations) Children were randomly assigned to either Cool Kids or a control condition (group support and attention [GSA]). Parents and children participated in completing the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-CP) and the self-reported Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at pre- and post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Results indicated that Cool Kids was significantly more efficacious compared with the GSA condition. At post-treatment and follow-up, a significantly greater proportion of children in the Cool Kids condition no longer met criteria for any anxiety diagnoses, compared with the children in the GSA condition. Limitations included a significant lack of congruence between parent and child reports.
Length of post-intervention follow-up: 3 months.
