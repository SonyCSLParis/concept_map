Here you can view a checklist we use in the journal to help kids identify their anxiety. It has been slightly modified for use here. It is strictly educational and should not be used to diagnose. It is just one helpful tool as you get your child help.
Anxiety responds to early detection and treatment. If you are concerned the first step could be a visit to the pediatrician. Bring a summary of symptoms and concerns so she can have as much information as possible to help you decide your next step.

Our daughter had been suffering through clinical panic attacks since she was six years old. Now at nine she is able to control her thoughts enough to veer away from the cascade of events that is a panic attack. This is due in part to the truly educational and generous amount of information available on your website and the parent CDs in the Turnaround program. I was very enlightened and made some needed changes in my views and behaviors resulting in the correct support to my daughter... the education I gained is changing her life. I can't thank you enough for the help received, I view it as an immeasurable blessing.
Thank you for your help.
