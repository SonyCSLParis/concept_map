Higher standards and greater accountability have brought an alarming rise in test anxiety. To help students pass mandated assessments, teachers drill on facts and give endless practice tests. But teaching to the test isn't enough.
High stakes testing creates high anxiety which, in turn, lowers performance. Teachers need to do more. They need to prepare their students emotionally! Test Anxiety & What You Can Do About It offers constructive, powerful and proven strategies that:
Identify root causes of test anxiety
Reduce physical/emotional symptoms
Increase concentration/attention.
Finally, there is a resource that can help teachers at all grade levels address test anxiety in a practical way that will ultimately result in higher test scores. Learn about techniques to use during the pre-testing, test-in-progress and post-testing phases. Helpful tips on how to work with anxious parents are also included.
The No Child Left Behind Act mandates yearly standardized testing starting in third grade. Everyone-including principals, teachers, parents and kids alike-feel the pressure. It's time that the impact of this stress is acknowledged and addressed as part of our classroom instruction. No teacher should be without this valuable resource.
