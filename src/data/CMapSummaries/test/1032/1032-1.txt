Teary goodbyes and fits are a common part of a child's early developmental years.
These hysterics usually appear when a feeling is sensed that a dear parent or primary caregiver is going away. When such alarm is set off, these little, innocent children intensely erupt into wails of tears and anxiety. Though these encounters tend to be difficult for the child, this separation anxiety - as it is called, is but a normal part of a child's growth and development.
However, when a child's fear seems to intensify as time progresses or if these anxieties persist enough to cause problems at home or in school, this innocent wailings need to be examined further. A possibility exists that such child could be suffering from separation anxiety disorder.
To learn and understand what these children are going through, read on to see their main similarities and differences.
Separation Anxiety: The Normal
Truthfully, the significance of a primary caregiver to a child cannot be duly described in plain words and phrases. However, the intensity of such relationship can be fairly demonstrated as early in infancy.
Per observation, infants as young as 4 months exhibit displeasure when their caregivers try to leave them even for a mere second. This disapproval is clearly manifested in their wails and seething cries. At age 5 months, these infants show anxiety when a stranger is present or when a different person other than their primary caregiver gives care. Restlessness, thrashing of the arms and legs and initiation of cries are signs of this anxiety. At age 8 months old, this anxiety reaches its peak, earning the name "8-month anxiety".
Toddlers and preschoolers as well show signs of distress when separated from their caregivers. This is normally shown by their frequent throws of temper tantrums. As capable as they are to already know what they want, they still do not have the vocabulary to fully express their feelings in a more acceptable way.
Though difficult and unsettling, this anxiety manifested by these young infants is a developmental milestone that indicates that the child is able to distinguish a primary caregiver from other people. This also implies that a healthy emotional development is present as poor reaction to separation from the caregiver is demonstrated by the child.
The onset of separation anxiety varies widely from child to child. Some kids have it as early as 6 months. Some have it at a much later date approximately between 18 months and 2 1/2 years of age. While others, fortunately, never go through it at all.
How long normal separation anxiety lasts differs from child to child. The child's temperament, in some cases, proves to be an important factor. Those children who seem to be clingier as infants tend to be more vulnerable to separation anxiety. Moreover, separation anxiety can last until elementary school years and still be classified as normal.
Separation Anxiety Disorder: The Abnormal
For most children, the anxiety they feel whenever they are separated from their caregiver passes with time and without the need for any medical attention. But there are instances wherein separation anxiety poses a threat to the child. If a simple separation limits an older child's ability to engage in normal activities such as common play and school work, this anxiety could mean a deeper medical condition.
Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder in children that is distinguished by extreme distress and hysterical fits whenever a child is separated from a primary caregiver, may it be a parent, relative or nanny. These worries are not typical and borders on the extreme when compared to the occasional, mild worries manifested within the child's own peers. In contrast to those children who are purely withdrawn, children suffering from separation anxiety disorder become significantly agitated even in moments of brief separations, for example being away from their primary giver or their home. Factors that may add to the feelings of anxiety include change in caregiver or routine of care, minor or major illnesses of the child, birth of a sibling, divorce of parents, or death of a loved one.
Typically, the anxiety shown in separation anxiety disorder is due to the fear of the child that the parents will never return or that something bad will happen to this loved one. Other symptoms this anxiety causes include refusal of the child to go to school for weeks, clinging to the caregiver even inside the house, fear of going to sleep, constant complain of physical sickness like stomachache or headache and withdrawal from family, friends, and peers.
Taking care of a child with separation anxiety and separation anxiety disorder is all about keeping the child feel safe. A caring and understanding environment at home and in school are effective means to reduce the symptoms of anxiety these children are experiencing.
