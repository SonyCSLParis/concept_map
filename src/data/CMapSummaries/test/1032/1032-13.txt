What is social anxiety and what are social anxiety symptoms? Social anxiety in a nutshell is the fear a person has or the distress a person feels when faced with situations that involve being around other people. Social anxiety symptoms include the fear of being in a crowd, the fear of being introduced to another person, distress when becoming the center of attention or even simply being looked at.
Children and adults alike can suffer from these social anxiety symptoms and they may have a hard time leading the kind of life that is normal. When these social anxiety symptoms show up in a person, they often create a certain reaction that often cause the person to shun attention. The people who suffer from this ailment often go to great lengths to make themselves seem invisible or to keep people from noticing them. They are often underachievers or average performers in school or at work. There is even a possibility that they may end up sinking into a state of depression or even resort to substance abuse just to escape from these things that cause their social anxiety symptoms to emerge.
Many people tend to wonder how these social anxiety symptoms come about. While there are people who may say that these social anxiety symptoms are the results of some traumatic experiences in the past, some even hint at genetics having something to do with the problems. However, there is actually no proven reason for the occurrence of social anxiety disorder.
If a person suspects that he or she may be suffering from social anxiety disorder, getting a diagnosis done by a physician is logical. To admit to such a problem is the first most important step. Then, going for a check-up will be much easier. Doctors may then take physical exams like blood tests to help determine that what the patient is experiencing is not an ailment that has similar symptoms like social anxiety disorder. Once it is determined that the person is indeed suffering from social anxiety disorder through these physical and psychological evaluations, treatments can then be exacted to try and help the person get over this affliction.
Treatments for this problem usually include a combination of psychological treatments and medication. Medication may come in the form of anti-depressants while psychological help will be offered in the form of therapy. Support from close friends and family is also encouraged when people are facing this problem. Support therapy, or the help that family and friend provide, can greatly help patients since social anxiety symptoms seem to be less prevalent when there are caring people around.
Social anxiety disorder is a mental illness that impacts the lives of millions of people and those close to them. Often putting the breaks on a person's ability to enjoy life to its fullest, this disorder can manifest itself in a number of different ways.
Social anxiety disorder is typically characterized as a strong fear of scrutiny in public situations. In some cases, people will actually feel very real, very overpowering physical symptoms that accompany attacks of fear. For example, a person with social anxiety disorder might have a problem eating in public. He or she might be so afraid of looking bad, slovenly or sloppy that a sensation of choking presents while trying to eat.
The actual manifestation of social anxiety disorder tends to vary greatly from case to case. Some people, for example, might only suffer from very situational problems. People with extreme fears of public speaking are a good example of this. Other people facing social anxiety disorder might be afraid of speaking on the telephone, dating or attending parties. These people, however, might do perfectly fine in other social situations.
In extreme cases of social anxiety disorder, the condition infiltrates all aspects of life. A person with severe social anxiety disorder might fear going to school, trying to go to work or even going out of the house for a movie or on a date. While all forms of social anxiety disorder hamper a person's ability to live life to the fullest, those who suffer from extreme cases often cordon themselves off from life almost entirely.
Some of the symptoms that make social anxiety so troublesome are precisely those that people seek to prevent by avoiding situations that trigger them. Common physical symptoms of the disorder include nausea, headaches, dizziness, blushing and even profuse sweating and shaking. To stop the symptoms from happening - and to prevent embarrassment - people with social anxiety disorder often do anything they can to keep themselves away from triggers. Although this might seem like a smart thing to do, the end result is quite often avoidance of important and meaningful contact with the outside world.
Social anxiety disorder is quite often very treatable. People with the condition can seek counseling, take medications and work to overcome their fears. As is the case with all anxiety disorders, however, this is a serious condition that isn't necessarily recovered from immediately. People who are close to those with social anxiety problems are generally advised to offer lots of support and exercise patience.
When fears of looking foolish, embarrassing oneself or being scrutinized in public overwhelm, a more serious condition can be the root cause. Seeking help is almost always advised to ensure a person lives life to its fullest.
Social anxiety disorder affects millions of Americans, leading them to avoid important and often life-enriching interactions. Characterized by an intense fear of certain social situations or all interactions, this condition can sideline a life in a very big way. People who suffer from the disorder will find that social anxiety support is available, if they will reach out for it.
Social anxiety support can help a person suffering from this serious condition learn the tools they need to overcome it. While a "cure" might not always be available, people with social anxiety can and quite often do manage to equip themselves with the right social anxiety support to face their fears and shine in situations that once terrified them.
Social anxiety support can come in several forms. The three most common include professional, personal and self-support. When all three combine, the outcome tends to be very bright.
Professional Social Anxiety Support
Psychologists and psychiatrists can help give people the right kind of social anxiety support to begin overcoming their fears. Medications can be used to control the symptoms of the condition - especially if panic attacks are present. In addition to drug therapies, professionals are often able to provide a unique brand of social anxiety support. This is nothing more than therapy. It is, however, very important for helping equip a person with the courage they need to face social situations and the tools they need to overcome any symptoms that might arise.
Personal Social Anxiety Support
Friends and family are very important in regard to social anxiety support. People who suffer from this condition are often better able to face their fears and learn to work through the problems when they have a friend or loved one standing by their side. Unfortunately, since social anxiety can often lead to a person totally shutting off from outside contact, this type of support isn't always available.
If social anxiety disorder is suspected or diagnosed, friends and family can do a great deal to help. By refusing to turn away and leave the person to live with their fears alone, loved ones can provide very valuable personal social anxiety support.
People who suffer from social anxiety can help themselves, too. In addition to seeking out professional help, there are tools they can use to face and overcome situations that triggered panic attacks in the past. Some of the self-support tools that are very useful include:
• Meditation. Learning relaxation and visualization techniques can be very helpful, especially in social situations. • Support groups. While it is, no doubt, difficult to attend face-to-face sessions, they can be incredibly helpful. This kind of social anxiety support shows sufferers they are not alone. It also helps them learn tools and tricks others have used to get over fears of public situations. • Self-affirmation. Learning to refocus negative thoughts into positive ones can provide the ability to overcome some of the symptoms of social anxiety.
Social anxiety support is often vital for helping a person deal with or overcome this very serious condition. Friends, family, medical professionals and the person him or herself can do a lot to provide necessary social anxiety support.
Most often when people are diagnosed with having a social anxiety disorder, they are unsure of what it is.

Some of the uses for PureCalm are to naturally promote a persons inner calmness, bring forward healthy feelings, balance any unsettled emotions of pressures and stress and to soothe restlessness and irritability.

Social anxiety is something we all experience at one time or another in our lives. It's when we feel worry, fear, apprehension or nervousness regarding being in a social setting where others will see us. There are different kinds and degrees of social anxiety. Some experience a real fear of speaking or performing in public. Some individuals are shy, which is a form of a physiological problem, which may result in excessive blushing or sweating. People that are very shy like this may often feel that others are looking at them negatively, so they may avoid certain circumstances.
Many individuals will eventually get over some of their social anxiety and eventually learn to relax and enjoy themselves in public. While they may not turn into social butterflies, they are able to be out in public around others. Unfortunately, there are those that never get over their social anxiety, have what is known as social phobia or social anxiety disorder, and need to seek the help of mental health professionals.
Some people believe that shyness and social anxiety is a hereditary trait, while others believe it's a learned thing. Some of us are very shy around strangers while others enjoy being around strangers and in social settings. You may have seen many young children hide behind their parents when greeted by strangers or not members of the immediate family. Many times, they outgrow this as they get older. However, some times this anxiety stays with them as they get older often getting worse. A child's development as well as surroundings often determine how and if a shy child will remain shy as they grow older.
It's sometimes difficult to distinguish between shyness and social anxiety. Normal shyness goes away or lessens with age and practice while social anxiety seems to worsen over time. Social anxiety will cause extreme distress as well as the inability to even function in a social setting. The person that suffers from social anxiety constantly feels they are being watched and judged negatively by others. These feelings may be real, but are usually exaggerated in their mind. Statistics show that over 13% of the population suffers from social anxiety at one time or another.
Some of the symptoms of social anxiety are trembling, sweating, blushing, nausea, palpitations and stuttering. Some individuals may even experience panic attacks .
Psychotherapy has been known to be quite helpful for the individual suffering from social anxiety. Whether it's individual therapy or as part of a group, psychotherapy combined with cognitive behavior therapy can be quite helpful.
Many times when people are not feeling well emotionally, they are unsure of what the problem is. However, unless they get themselves psychologically evaluated, there is absolutely no way of ever determining what is making you feel so badly; even after the evaluation you do not want to believe in the results! Except of course, knowing that you have a social anxiety disorder!
What more and more people are finding out about themselves is that they have a social anxiety disorder and depression, both at the same time. In fact, many people are now being diagnosed with having depression because of all the problems in their lives; which are on a day-to-day basis! In fact, there are more than 19 million people that are said to have a social anxiety disorder and depression in the world (if not singly then both at the same time).
After you find out what the specific problem is, whether you have some unfinished business or you have a social anxiety disorder and depression, the next step is to figure out where you want to go next. More importantly, you will want to figure out what you have to do next, to ensure that you get yourself both physically and mentally well! In fact, a person can not have a happy and healthy life if they are not mentally well and happy!
One of the best things to determine where you are going next or what the next step is, is if there will be anyone there to help you through the whole process; which in almost every case there is at least one person. Once you determine who that someone special is that is helping you through your problems with your social anxiety disorder and depression, you will be able to get the proper help you need! However, you will first have to determine if you want a professional doctor to help you or if you want to try "all-natural" techniques and medications.
Even though you have been diagnosed with having a social anxiety disorder and depression (which you already know you have/had the social anxiety disorder), there are both pros and cons to both treatments; medical or natural. In fact, one of the biggest reasons why many people choose to go the all-natural way is because of the whole cost issues and insurance companies. In most cases, all-natural techniques are half the cost of medical procedures! Another reason why many people choose to take all-natural medications over doctor prescribed medications is because the all-natural medications are non-habit forming; therefore, causing no troubles when you are "cured".
The biggest thing to deal with once you find out that you have a social anxiety disorder and depression is what type of treatment you want to go through. Once you determine that, you will be down the road of smooth sailing to getting well; then you can relax!!!
Just like grown ups, children are subject to a host of psychological complaints and even full-blown illnesses. Anxiety in children, in fact, is not out of the question. Contrary to popular belief, children do have things to be worried about and no matter how minute their problems seem to adults, they can be very big deals to little ones and adolescents. While minor anxiety in children is quite prevalent, serious anxiety disorders are not. Understanding the differences between the two, however, can be important for recognizing real problems and making sure they are properly treated.
'Normal' Anxiety In Children
Just like their adult counterparts, children are subject to a number of fears and concerns. Some are quite common in childhood, in fact. Normal anxiety in children is generally characterized by anticipated "phases" and behaviors that tend to pass with time and little effort to resolve. Whether anxiety in children is caused by separation anxiety, a fear of "monsters" under the bed or angst about upcoming exams, these fears are very real to the children that suffer from them. In the case of normal anxiety in children, the fears do pass over time.
When There Is Cause For Concern
While a certain degree of anxiety in children is expected and quite normal, when the fears become overwhelming and seem impossible to control, a child might be suffering from a more serious condition. Actual separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder and many other classes of anxiety problems are not unheard of in children.
According to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America, just about the whole spectrum of anxiety disorders has been diagnosed in certain children. In some cases, teens, for example, might suffer from anxiety and depression at the same time. Unfortunately, if anxiety in children is left untreated, youngsters are at higher risk for a host of other problems, including failure in school, substance abuse and even an inability to develop social skills.
Parents, caregivers and other adults around children are urged to keep an eye out for the warning signs of anxiety. When anxiety in children is present in the true, clinical form the fears that seem like phases will not pass with time. Children might suffer from actual panic attacks , try to isolate themselves and even go out of their way to avoid situations that make them particularly uncomfortable or vulnerable.
If anxiety in children is suspected, it is generally advised that parents seek out professional advice. Anxiety is generally a treatable condition and can even be curable in some cases. Addressing anxiety in children head on can prevent a host of other problems and put children on the right footing for enjoying life.
