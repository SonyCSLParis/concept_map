To become a special needs teacher, a relevant Bachelor's degree or higher degree in teaching is needed. In some instances relevant experience is required in addition to the formal qualification. Registration or licensing is required in addition. 35
Where students with special needs are catered for in special schools, special education units or special classes attached to mainstream schools, or in special education developmental units, they are usually taught by a specialist teacher or a team of special educators. The teacher-in-charge of the special education unit usually reports to the principal of the primary or secondary school to which the unit is attached. In special schools, the principal is the manager. 11
The individually tailored programmes in special schools (documented in Individual Education Plans, IEPs ) are delivered by special education teachers. Services that may be available to support students in school include advisory visiting teachers in impairment areas, early special education advisory teachers, speech-language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, nurses, school transition officers, guidance officers and orientation and mobility teachers.  12    56
Qualification as a special education teacher usually requires the completion of a pre-service teacher preparation programme, such as a Bachelor of Education specialising in special educational needs, or a pre-service programme, followed by completion of a postgraduate qualification in learning support, special needs or inclusive education. 56
All initial teacher training programmes in Queensland address issues of inclusivity and diversity of student need. 56
The following courses are offered in several university faculties of education in Queensland. There is only one initial teacher training programme focused on special educational needs, based at Griffith University. There are, however, a number of initial teacher training programmes which provide a specialisation/major in special needs/inclusive education. In addition, there are a number of postgraduate programmes for established teachers. 56
University of Queensland ( http://www.uq.edu.au/ ) Bachelor of Education (Secondary): Dual degree and graduate entry. 56
To become a special education teacher, there are no formal requirements although it is often the case that teachers of students with disabilities have completed a postgraduate diploma of education specialising in special education, after completing a degree in teaching. Although there are no specific courses in special education available in Tasmania, courses are widely available in other states and Territories. 37   58
To become a special education teacher it is usually necessary to complete a postgraduate diploma or degree in special education, after completing an initial degree in teaching. The Victorian Department of Education and Training also requires special education graduates to have completed the equivalent of at least 45 days of appropriate practical experience, including a minimum of 30 days of supervised special education school experience and professional practice in a variety of settings. 52
'Specialist Area Guidelines' set out subject qualification requirements for specialist teachers, including special education teachers. These are available here .
In addition, the Victorian Department of Education and Training runs teacher professional development programmes, which are specially designed for practising teachers. One of the modules available is 'Classroom strategies for students with special needs'. 50

Master of Education (coursework) majoring in special education Students are normally required to have four years of pre-service teacher training to qualify for entry to the course. This course was introduced in 2005. 59
In-service training In addition, professional development programmes in special education are specifically designed for practising teachers. 50
In Queensland, the majority of staff employed to teach within pre-service teacher preparation programmes are experienced classroom teachers with postgraduate qualifications in education. Generally, full-time staff employed in a university will have completed or will be completing a PhD in Education or a related field. Any staff visiting pre-service teachers during the professional experience component of their programme must be registered teachers with the Queensland Board of Teacher Registration. 56
Many institutions employ practising teachers to assist with the delivery of the on-campus components of the pre-service programme. All pre-service teachers in Queensland must successfully complete 80 days of supervised professional experience within their pre-service programme. These professional experiences are supervised by registered teachers practising in schools. 56
The Queensland Board of Teacher Registration Professional Standards for pre-service teachers include: Graduates will exhibit the skills to create supportive and intellectually challenging learning environments to engage all learners. Graduating teachers will draw upon pedagogical, curriculum and assessment knowledge and skills to engage all learners. They will use knowledge about learners and learning to create meaningful learning opportunities that lead to desired learning outcomes for individuals and groups. They will be able to design and implement learning opportunities that are socially just and inclusive, and promote higher order thinking and critical enquiry. In designing learning environments, they will acknowledge the diversity of learners' language and socio-cultural realities as well as their diverse abilities and interests, and strive to ensure that learning is supported for all students. 56
Each university offering pre-service teacher training programmes is responsible for the development of the content and structure of their programmes. This is usually completed in conjunction with reference groups including key stakeholders and must ensure the Board of Teacher Registration's Professional Standards for graduates are met. 56

Master of Education (coursework) majoring in special education
Successful completion of the course and the practicum qualifies graduates to teach children with special needs in both specialist and mainstream education settings in Victoria. 59
Beginning teachers are initially granted provisional registration in Queensland and, to be granted full registration, are required to provide a principal's report at the conclusion of 12 months, or equivalent, of full-time teaching. 56
The induction of beginning teachers is the responsibility of the employer. However, many pre-service programmes incorporate an internship programme which aims to smooth the transition from pre-service to beginning teacher in various ways, including allocation of a mentor and a reduced teaching load. See section 7.5.7.1  in addition. 56
7.5.7 Key priorities, innovative practices and research in initial teacher training
7.5.7.1 Current key priorities for initial teacher training for teachers of students with special educational needs
Many Queensland universities have introduced an advanced professional experience component to their programmes to assist pre-service teachers in meeting some of the challenges faced by beginning teachers. This advanced professional practice is referred to as an internship and can take on many forms depending on the focus of the university's programme. An internship builds on supervised professional experiences by providing pre-service teachers with the opportunity to experience all facets of a teacher's work. This occurs through increased autonomy and responsibility for the tasks and duties performed in the classroom, school and community while the pre-service teacher is being mentored through the process. To be eligible for an internship, pre-service teachers must have successfully completed a minimum of 80 days of supervised practicum , thereby ensuring that this is an additional experience providing greater opportunities for linking theory and practice. It also assists the transition between pre-service and beginning teaching. 56

7.5.7.4 Current priorities for research into initial teacher training for teachers of children with special educational needs
The University of Queensland School of Education houses the Fred and Eleanor Schonell Special Education Research Centre. This has been the pre-eminent centre for research related to individuals with diverse needs in Australia, including those with disabilities. 34    56
The Centre for Innovation in Education at Queensland University of Technology aims to conduct research in the following three focus areas of education: Pedagogy and lifespan learning Policy development and service delivery Learning organisations in social contexts. 56
These focus areas reflect both the research expertise and recent research achievements of members of the Centre, and the broader focus of faculty research, which has knowledge work as its unifying component. 56
The focus of research in the "Pedagogy and lifespan learning" strand is on advancing flexible, diverse and sustainable practice across the lifespan. Specifically, research in this programme strand focuses on: Cultural, cognitive, social, physical, emotional, environmental and aesthetic applications Diversity in childhood, adolescence and adulthood Multimodal learning Literacies and numeracies. 56
