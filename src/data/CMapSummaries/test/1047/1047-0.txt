In addition to being special needs educational advisor for families with twice-exceptional children and Contributing Editor to the new publication 2e: Twice-Exceptional Newsletter , I am co-founder and co-listowner of the GT-Special email list for families with gifted/special needs children - founded because my co-listowner and I needed a place where we could talk with other parents about our uniquely gifted children.  I am also founder and listowner for GT-Spec-Home , for families homeschooling gifted/special needs children.
It can be difficult for siblings of special needs children to understand that parents are not favoring the special needs child, that he or she truly has severe learning issues, yet at the same time to know that we empathize with their frustrations. In Siblings of Twice-Exceptional Children , I make some suggestions for dealing with these issues.

It's important to realize that there are great individual differences among gifted children, and that those who are most highly gifted may not "look" gifted in school. The article Exceptionally and Profoundly Gifted Students: An Underserved Population is an excellent introduction to this topic by Miraca Gross, a psychologist and researcher specializing in exceptionally gifted children.
The video, "How Difficult Can This Be?:  The F.A.T. City Workshop" by Rick Lavoie.  The description from the website says it all:  "For kids with learning disabilities, the classroom can be an intimidating place. In this workshop, Richard Lavoie shows why. He leads a group of parents, educators, psychologists, and children through a series of exercises that cause Frustration, Anxiety, and Tension...feelings all too familiar to children with learning disabilities. By dramatizing the classroom experience so vividly, Lavoie lets us see the world through the eyes of a child. At the end of the workshop, participants discuss strategies for working more effectively with learning disabled children." Click here to see a video clip.

Stories/Personal Experiences
By parents
Enabling Our Children by Deborah Thorpe. "I hear it everyday. I belong to a parent support group for children with learning disabilities and ADHD, one of the largest Internet listserv groups for parent support for these disabilities. There seems to be a constant, reoccurring topic among our group: 'The teacher says I am enabling him to be the way he is' or 'The teacher says if we gave him more discipline he'd be fine.' Parents of children with invisible disabilities are constantly being blamed for their child's difficulties. We are easy targets."
Fighting Guilt by Charlotte Riggle.  "Misplaced parental guilt is a monster I know all too well. Seducing you with what might have been, it wastes your time, erodes your confidence, devours your energy, and distracts you from what is - which is the only thing you can do anything about."
My Mockingbird by Ruthie. "My son was reading Harper Lee's story To Kill a Mockingbird - I was struck by how this wonderful story's metaphor applies to twice-exceptional children."
Welcome to Holland by Emily Perl Kingsley.  "I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this......"  Although written by the parent of a child with Down's Syndrome, it is applicable to all of us dealing with the emotional rollercoaster of parenting special-needs children.
