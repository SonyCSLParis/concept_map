There seem to be a lack of training and understanding by teachers, principals, GO's and administrators about the needs of gifted children, especially those labelled "underachieving" . There needs to be a focus on using strengths to address any weak core skills or areas of challenge rather than focusing on weaknesses in gifted children. Depth, complexity, rigour and higher-order thinking need to be stressed when teaching gifted children. It is not simply enough to differentiate the curriculum in the regular classroom. These children need to mix with like-minds who are not necessarily same age-peers. These children need to have the recommendations from their psychologists and other professionals, acted upon not ignored or even dismissed by schools. Gifted children need to be involved in activities that are not an add-on to the curriculum. Enthusiasm and initiative should be encouraged. In an ideal world each school should have a gifted coordinator to support teachers in developing programs for their gifted students. Identification needs to be thorough and un-biased by personality, race, gender or socio-economic background. Identification should be a first step to implementing a gifted program in State schools. Identification should include, student nominations, parent nominations, teachers and others who have an interest in the child, as well as portfolios of the child's work and other input from psychologists, GO's, OT's and speech language pathologists where necessary. Not just teacher nominations should be used, research has shown that many teachers do not know what to look for when identifying gifted children and often pick the so called "teacher pleasers". QLD universities need to have compulsory undergraduate training in gifted education for teachers, as UNSW and UNE do. If not, QLD risks being left behind by the other states and indeed the rest of the world when it comes to education of gifted and talented students.

Not a submission as yet but a preliminary queston: does anyone know if Qld has a section in its Education Act which is equivalent to, or similar to, s 20(e) of the NSW EDUCATION ACT 1990 : SECTION 20 Assistance to government school children with special needs (1) The Minister may provide or arrange special or additional assistance for government school children with special needs, such as: (a) children with disabilities, or (a1) children with significant learning difficulties, or (b) children who live in isolated or remote areas, or (c) children who are from non-English speaking backgrounds, or (d) Aboriginal children, or (e) children with special abilities, or (f) children who are disadvantaged by their socio-economic background. (2) Any such special or additional assistance may include the provision of financial assistance, facilities, courses of study, staff, staff training or correspondence schools. (3) Any such financial assistance is to be paid out of money to be provided by Parliament. (4) For the purposes of subsection (1) (a1), a child has a significant learning difficulty if a qualified teacher or other qualified education professional is of the opinion that the child is not, regardless of the cause, performing in the basic educational areas of reading, writing, spelling and mathematics in accordance with the child's peer age group and stage of learning.

In Scotland, they have legislation in place to ensure that gifted children are included in the definition of special needs children. A similar attitude should be adopted here so that the funding will be available to provide for the needs of these children. There is no chance of recognition in the new Qld curriculum as there is no recognition of the needs of gifted children in the national curriculum. The national curriculum was designed with the assistance of the Australian Education Union, God bless its communist heart. How about this for a question.... When will Queensland set an example to the rest of the world and ability group all classrooms? Or.... why doesn't Qld abandon the concept of OP scores and adopt the IB as the standard benchmark for achievement? How about.... When will schools be a place where children are challenged and inspired? Not just at the occassional extra-curricula activity but as part and parcel of every day learning.

Having a provision in the legislation, as Scotland does, will not ensure that anything useful is implemented. NSW has one (see 20(e) in my posting above) but most of the NSW parents I coach report that when they take the legislation to the school, they are met with, "We don't know anything about that - and anyway our school is too small/big/poor/rural/innercity/busy/lcrowded/low-socio-economic to bother with things like that". QSA does recognise giftednes as a special need in its policy on special provisions for in-school asessments at the senior levels: http://www.qsa.qld.edu.au/downloads/10-12/assess_snr_sc_policy.pdf ---- but I don't know if anything similar is enshrined anywhere in Qd legislation - am hoping somone else knows, as it would be a good place to start. The point was made over and over last weekend that a governent can have all the Frameworks and Action Plans it likes, but if schools smirk when these bits of paper are mentioed by parents, then what? No. 1 of the 3 priority points at the top of this page is spot on - who does the policing?

Ignorance of the law is no excuse for non-compliance. Being "too small/big/poor/rural/innercity/busy/lcrowded/low-socio-economic to bother with things like that" is no excuse for non-compliance with the law. If educational authorities are non-compliant in Scotland, there is a complaints tribunal and there are the courts.
However, I do agree that this will not ensure that anything useful is implemented. No law, however well-intentioned or draconian, will ensure that any child will receive an adequate education. I have not seen anything of this nature in the Qld Legislation but it has been a few years since I read it.

Many schools, including ours, have not even heard of the current action plan that requires full implementation by the end of this year. If this is the case how can we be sure that any changes/amendments will be adhered to? Of a greater conern, these children get little or no encouragement by teachers and principals alike, if anything they are considered a nuisance. Is this because of lack of understanding or lack of funding for teacher's aids? Why do we not as a society encourage and celebrate these children?

Hmm, priorities, where do I start?
Certainly I think the three key points listed are important. For us currently the biggest issue is the recognition of the needs of gifted children and knowing what to do about it. So as a first step, there does need to be recognition in the curriculum of the needs of gifted children, and lots of opportunites to cater for this. Further, there needs to be more teacher training in the area of giftedness - what to look for (including the fact that these kids can be underachieving and even twice exceptional), what the special learning needs are, what does and doesn't work (no, sticking a child in an aged-based classroom and giving him an extra task every now and then is not sufficient), and some ideas of strategies that are successful for these kids - eg acceleration and various class grouping options such as ability based grouping and cluster grouping.
As a next step I'd like to have more options available for our gifted kids. There are only a small number of state primary schools that cater well for gifted children but being gifted doesn't get a child into these schools. There should be exceptions for gifted children to attend as out of area students as they have a special need which the school caters for. Other schools with a number of identified gifted students should also be offered funding and trarining to set up appropriate programs also to give families more options.
We have only just hit the "primary school dilemma" so my high school knowledge is not good. But from what I know, there are also limited options at this level as well, apart from the academies and even then they are only from year 10. More in the way of selective schools like Melbourne's University High would be really helpful.
Being new to all this, I am sure there are many other burning issues that I haven't covered, but I think it's great that this is being discussed and that the QATGC is participating in these discussions. There are enough gifted kids for this to be an Educational priority, and the results would be well worth it. It's really a shame that so much talent and potential is going to waste, and that there are so many of us parents banging our heads against proverbial brick walls.

Current action plan terminates in 2010. So what will be the outcome if schools don't achieve an expected level and how will we know that school assessments are valid?
Speaking from experience with 3 different state schools I agree that it doesn't matter how many pieces of paper there are with Policies, Frameworks, psych assessments etc as the school can, and usually will, choose to ignore them. Accountability is key and if EQ must provide auditing of schools. Setting up a parent body from a school community may be helpful to drive changes but this requires permission from the school and /or P&C so if they are not "Gifted Friendly" then won't be allowed. It would be interesting if parents and students were to audit their own school. Parents need to be heard, they need someone in EQ to go to when they have exhausted avenues in their school. A number of parents all trying to voice concerns individually can't have the same impact as a whole group.
Recognition and Integration of gifted education strategies in new syllabus documents. - definitely. Schools currently say they can't change the curriculum to meet needs of gifted students.
Role of Central Office in providing support - e.g., a Senior Policy Officer whose responsiblities are to coordinate, audit and guide policy development needs to be appointed
The culture needs to change from the top down, both within EQ and within each school community. Is the current minimum standard of GEM training enough? it doesn' t appear to be. Especially when the school may have one or two GEM trained staff and they are not able to change the culture of the school or are not in the classrooms. I would like to see at least one staff member in each school with post grad tertiary quals in gifted ed. as a starting point. This person also needs adequate support from EQ as they are often battling entrenched school culture or staff who are against gifted education. EQ staff training in Gifted education has to include training in dual exceptionalities. Unless EQ back this up with funding, schools will continue to ignore these students needs.
Enough from me. I sincerely hope the parent body can find voice via the QAGTC.

I cannot agree more with these comments about educators being accountable. What is the point as Irina says, of having Frameworks etc. if there is no accountability? Why have policies in place if no one has to follow them?
All the time and money expended on making documents that look good but achieve almost nothing because no one ensures implementation! The Framework for gifted education reads well and sounds like a great plan but I know numerous schools who haven't heard of it, can't/won't implement it and there's just about nothing anyone can do about it to make sure it is followed. Whcih leaves our gifted and talented kids where they were before the framework documentation existed, out in the cold with nothing to show for the money supposedly spent on gifted eucation in QLD.
Being called the SMART STATE is embarrasing when our gifted and talented kids are treated like this.

Hi ronkpavia,
I think that by putting these things in place and not delivering is worse than not doing anything at all. If there was nothing in place, there would be no raising of expectations.

I think ronkpavia has it perfectly. There are hardly any teachers who actually have any understanding of how to nurture and support gifted and talented students.. all the resources go into assisting the struggling students... I find it really interesting that there is so much support for a child who has an IQ 30 points below average... but nothing except more work for those with an IQ 30 points above... surely they deserve curriculum modification and support, time and effort as well? I also strongly agree with teachers perception of underachieving gifted students.... apparently it is a difficult concept to grasp... if they aren't showing their brilliance, then apparently this means they are not gifted! More pressure on schools to cater (properly) for the gifted and more mandatory under graduate and professional development is essential! I have been in too many schools that have policies written on paper and promises made to parents... but no actual action! It is time that gifted and talented was brought into the light!

We couldn't agree more, we are currently going through the processes of trying to get our school to 'activate' their supposed G&T program and all we can see is more and more money being spent at the other end of the scale. Most teachers we talk to are of the same opinion, that not nearly enough is being done for ANY other children [let alone gifted], apart from the lower end. HOW will we ever get the government to take notice when they don't listen to their own teachers or to parents. We are constantly being told there is NO time or funding allocated for G&T and/or high achievers. Is there a school out there that actually does something??

I would like to see more programs like GERRIC available in Queensland. Why aren't there more programs like this in the supposed Smart State? Not only just in Brisbane but how about Townsville and Mackay or any regional town that has a university. Gifted programs are expensive, why do we need to add travel expenses on top?
Although if the above points about education are addressed then there would be less need for these programs as the educational needs of gifted students would be address through their "normal" schooling.

My daughter is currently in year 9. This year and last year she was put in the Academic Achievers Program. Whilst it is terrific that there is a program to cater to bright children, there is a serious need for teacher's and principals to be educated in regards to teaching gifted children. I would love to see these staff attend a course run by the University of NSW Gerric Team. They have done their homework, so to speak, and are well versed in ALL aspects of gifted education. Educators need to understand ALL the needs of gifted children. You cannot just throw them in a harder class, give them LOADS more work, no recognition and no support. Gifted children are still children, not machines. They need down time like everyone else yet the amount of homework they are given in each subject does not really allow for this. The Queensland Department of Education's Gifted and Talented Action Plan 2008 - 2010 states in their Vision statement:- "Students who are gifted will feel valued and supported in a learning environment which both challenges and inspires them to pursue excellence and possess a passion for lifelong learning." The Academic Achievers Program does go some way towards challenging them but I have not seen anything yet that makes the children I know feel valued, supported or inspired. If we want to achieved success in this area then I think the single most useful action would be to educate our educators and parents via GERRIC.
