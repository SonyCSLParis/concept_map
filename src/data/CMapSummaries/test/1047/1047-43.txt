Special Educational Needs
About the Special Educational Needs Service
The Special Educational Needs Service aims to meet the Local Authority's statutory duties under the Education Act 1996 in relation to pupils with special educational needs. The Council has a duty to identify, assess and make provision to meet the special educational needs of children within its area.
The Service aims to provide a range of educational opportunities and additional resources for children with special educational needs to enable the child's needs to be met in an inclusive setting.
Special Educational Needs: A Brief Explanation
Many children have some degree of special educational needs at some stage in their lives. Most of these additional needs are met by the school the child attends.
A child may have special educational needs as a consequence of:
Physical disability or significant medical condition
A problem with sight, hearing or speech
Behavioural, emotional or social difficulties
An Autistic Spectrum Disorder
Difficulties with reading, writing or numbers
Parents know their children better than anyone, and have a right to take part in decisions about their child's education. The closer a parent works with their child's teachers and school, the more successful any special help will be.
If you think that your child may have special educational needs you should:
Arrange to discuss this with the staff at your child's school, especially the member of staff designated as the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO)
If your concerns continue contact the Special Educational Needs Team using the details at the top of this page.
More detailed information, including a glossary of terms used within Special Educational Needs, can be found at the Teachernet website .
Special Educational Needs Provision
All schools have a special needs policy which sets out how children might be supported in school, copies are available in the school.
It is estimated that approximately 20% of pupils will have some kind of Special Educational Need at some time during their school life. It is expected that the majority of these Special Needs are such that they will be met in local mainstream schools without the additional involvement of the Council.
However, some pupils' Special Educational Needs may be such that the Council may consider that some additional or special provision is needed. This will be done in consultation with parents and professionals, and following a full formal assessment.
This provision would be made at the local mainstream school, or at a school or unit which has additional resourcing to meet particular needs. As far as possible, the Council seeks to meet pupils' Special Educational Needs in a mainstream setting.
In some exceptional cases it may be necessary for placement to be determined at one of the specialist schools within Doncaster, or at specialist schools outside this Council's catchment area.
To meet these exceptional needs the Local Authority maintains five special schools.
Coppice School (for Severe Learning Difficulties and autism/challenging behaviour - ages 3 to 19) based at Hatfield.
Heatherwood School (for Severe Learning Difficulties and complex needs - ages 3 to 19) based on Leger Way, Doncaster.
The Local Authority provides support for children with special needs through its Pre-School Service, and, if appropriate, Portage. These services are managed through the Early Years and Childcare Service, whose contact details can be found here .
