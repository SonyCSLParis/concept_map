The US government defines "Gifted &amp; Talented" students as those... "who give evidence of high achievement capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who need services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop those capabilities." 20 U.S.C. Section 7801(22) . ( Wrightslaw: No Child Left Behind , Title IX, Part A, (22). p. 526)
