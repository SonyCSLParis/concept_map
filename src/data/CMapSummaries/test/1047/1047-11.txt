Students are gifted when they perform, or show potential for performing, remarkably high levels of accomplishment in learning rate, depth of knowledge, and reasoning and problem-solving abilities when compared with others of their age, experience, and environment. Students who are gifted demonstrate significantly advanced cognitive abilities. (Alberta Education, 2004)
Children who are gifted have exceptional learning needs at school, in the community, and at home. Children who may be gifted are assessed in order to better understand their learning, social, and emotional needs. Schools require evidence of a child's special needs, including giftedness, in order to provide an appropriate school program.
Identification and Assessment of Gifted Learners Within the Calgary Board of Education, gifted learners are identified by the coordinated efforts of the school personnel, the child's parents, and an assessment by a psychologist. The information gathered in this process determines when a student meets the criteria as outlined by Alberta Education for consideration as a gifted learner.
To find out more about how to access psychological services at your child's CBE school, please contact the school Principal.
For parents of children who do not currently attend a CBE school often the services of a psychologist in private practice are required in order to determine, through assessment, whether their child meets the Alberta Education criteria to be considered a gifted learner.
Opportunities for Gifted Learners within the CBE Once a student has been identified as a gifted learner, the school will develop and implement an Individual Program Plan (IPP) designed to address the student's exceptional learning characteristics. (The IPP is a requirement of Alberta Education for all Special Education designations, including Giftedness.)
Students identified with gifted learning needs may seek access to a wide array of school programs within the CBE, including:
Their designated CBE community or neighbourhood school
CBE Alternative Programs
Gifted and Talented Education Program (GATE)
Your CBE Community or Neighbourhood School Many gifted learners attend their designated CBE community school where their exceptional learning needs are addressed through their Individual Program Plan (IPP). To find out more about the designated community school for your neighbourhood, refer to Schools Designation by Residential District and Grade .
CBE Alternative Programs Several of the CBE Alternative Programs (Program Choices) address the exceptional interests and skills of gifted learners. Examples of Alternative Programs include (but are not restricted to):
Fine & Performing Arts Programs
Immersion and International Language Programs
Sports Alternative Programs
Science Schools
Traditional Learning Centres
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Many gifted learners may benefit from a Special Education placement within the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Program. Gifted students within the congregated, grades 4 - 12, GATE Program are offered an array of curriculum opportunities also designed to meet their diverse needs, interests, and abilities, including (but not restricted to):
the opportunity to participate in a challenging curriculum
interaction with like-minded peers
the opportunity to explore areas of particular interest through independent research
curriculum compacting or acceleration, when appropriate
access to experts or mentors, when possible
For more information, please see the GATE brochure, placement process and forms below.
Sometimes it is helpful for parents to talk with other parents about Gifted Education and opportunities for their children. The GATE Parents' Association Website has helpful information for parents about the CBE GATE Education.
