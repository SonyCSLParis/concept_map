How Does A Student Become Eligible for Special Education?

How Does A Student Become Eligible for Special Education Services?
Local Education Agency's (LEA's) serving children with disabilities must develop and implement procedures that ensure that all children within their jurisdiction, regardless of the severity of their disability, and who need special education and related services are identified, located, and evaluated. Child Find also applies to children with disabilities who attend private schools, including children attending religious schools, within the LEA's jurisdiction, highly mobile children with disabilities (e.g., migrant children), homeless children, or children who are wards of the State and children who are suspected of having a disability and are in need of special education, even though they have not failed, been retained in a course or grade or are advancing from grade to grade.
Where is Special Education?
Each public agency must ensure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities ages 3-21, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular education classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

Intellectually gifted children and youth are those who perform at high levels in academic or creative fields when compared with others of their age, experience or environment. These children and youth require services not ordinarily provided by the regular school program. Children and youth possessing these abilities can be found in all populations, across all economic strata, and in all areas of human endeavor.

These include: public notice, equity to ensure that efforts are made to identify students among all populations and socio-economic groups, Second Grade Child Find and standard referrals made by teachers, counselors, administrators and parents/guardians. Parents must be informed when students are referred.
