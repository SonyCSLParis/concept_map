Gifted children have special needs and like all special needs children, they require something other than what is found in the general classroom. Books here discuss the academic needs of these children and ways to meet them.
Product Description: Parents of brainy kids can understand what's behind IQ testing and selection for special school programs with this guide to gifted education. Written by an IQ specialist, this guide details the history of IQ tests and how they measure intelligence, and familiarizes parents with signs of giftedness they can look for in their own children. Acknowledging that some bright and gifted kids can reach their full potential in a regular classroom, a detailed analysis of how gifted programs work helps parents decide which gifted programs, if any, are right for their children. A section on twice-exceptional, or 2E" kids, shows parents how to recognize signs of learning disabilities in their otherwise bright or achieving kids and how to access school support for those particular problems.
Product Description: This book is a real eye-opener for educators and parents unfamiliar with the full body of research in the field of curriculum for gifted education. Many current programs for gifted students are not adequate. Other programs do not fit the needs of particular gifted children. Rogers uses a solid base to explain to parents and educators what is needed in both cases. Various types of acceleration and enrichment, as well as grouping practices, are examined. For each educational option, Rogers delineates what the current research says about the benefit or lack of benefit to gifted children.
Features: * A sample inventory to determine strengths and weaknesses. * Designing an educational plan to fit a child's academic and social needs. * Explanations of current gifted education research. * Benefits of gifted educational options. * Recommendations for gifted education curriculum.
Product Description: With all the talk of failing schools these days, we often forget that schools can fail their brightest students too. Gifted children forced into a "one size fits all" approach to schooling find themselves bored or frustrated, which can lead to underachievement, behavioral problems, or depression. Without sufficient challenges and resources, say Jan and Bob Davidson, America's brightest young minds languish, never reaching their full potential. Society can't afford that loss.
In Genius Denied, the Davidsons -- founders of a nonprofit institute that provides assistance to gifted children -- offer hope and practical advice to parents and students alike. Through their own experiences and those of the families they've worked with, the Davidsons show parents how to find an appropriate education for their children, when to go outside the school system, and how to create a support network with school authorities and other parents. Genius Denied shows that with commitment and creativity, gifted students can get the education they deserve, one that nurtures their talents and minds.
Product Description: Highly and profoundly gifted children have typical behaviors in early childhood!
Written for parents and teachers who work with gifted children, this book describes behaviors of children who are measured at the highest ranges of intelligence. The data indicate many more of these children than previously thought, and show that current tests usually underestimate their abilities.
Fascinating vignettes from 50 different families and their highly intelligent children are included, and the children are classified into five Levels of intelligence. Testing, test scores, and interpretations of scores are explained in a new, eye-opening way. Parents and teachers will be able to compare a child's behaviors and developmental milestones to those of children in the five Levels chapters, and thus estimate their child's intellectual level and the implications for educational planning. Features include: · Information about testing and ceiling effects · Early developmental milestones · Family concerns · Choosing a school · Five Levels of gifted · Educational concerns · Instructional strategies
