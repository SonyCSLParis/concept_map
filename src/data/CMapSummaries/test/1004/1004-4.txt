How to Stop Depression in Children - Treatment Options
Many people do not realize that just like adults, small children and teenagers can struggle with depression and so we have to find solutions on how to stop depression in children. Kids can also experience varying types of depression and levels of severity. The primary difference between an adult and a child living with depression is that adults can recognize and understand the symptoms whereas a child would likely feel confused, frustrated, and even angry because of the symptoms being experienced and no understanding of why.
Although there are fewer small children with depression than there are teens and adults, the latest statistics are still alarming. According to experts, symptoms indicating depression have been identified in children as young as six years of age. Another statistic that is unnerving is that among children between the ages of nine and twelve, it is estimated that 12% have this mental health condition. In talking about how to stop depression in children , this is accomplished in two ways - prevention and treatment.
Prevention is the First Step on How to Stop Depression in Children
The first thing to know in learning how to stop depression in children is that there are many ways to prevent sadness from developing into full-fledged depression. Keep in mind that even very small children do an excellent job in hiding true feelings. Especially when living in a single family home, children want to keep the peace and make the parent happy so when something is wrong, rather than open up it is common for children to put their own emotions aside on behalf of the family.
However, some children act in the complete opposite way. For instance, some small children will start to misbehave when feeling depressed. This might include severe temper tantrums, stealing small items from a store, talking back to parents, or being disrespectful in school. Instead of assuming the child is simply being bad, a parent should recognize the new behavior and consider that depression might be the culprit.
As part of learning how to stop depression in children, we wanted to offer a few specific points regarding methods for preventing this type of problem from ever developing.
Listen to the Child - Sometimes, really listening to what a small child is trying to say can be tough. For one thing, we all have extremely busy lives so just getting through the day and handling responsibilities makes it difficult to concentrate on a conversation or even behavior of a small child. In addition, small children often have a difficult time getting important messages across. By spending one-on-one time with a child daily, asking questions but more importantly listening can reveal a lot. Even if a child's comments seem odd or silly, they should be taken seriously.
Regular Routines - Some children have no problem with change while others quickly spiral out of control. Establishing a regular routine would be critical for all children but most importantly for children who struggle with change. This would include time of waking up and going to bed, routine for doing homework, and even scheduled family fun time. Interestingly, studies have shown that when children do not get adequate sleep, depression often develops.
Good Deeds - As parents, a bad habit of reprimanding bad behavior opposed to praising good behavior forms. Even small words of praise are extremely encouraging to a child, which is why so many experts tell parents who want to know how to stop depression to still discipline but focus on offering praise.
Affirmation - Children need to know things they feel, think, and believe are affirmed by parents. For instance, if a child is mad, rather than get upset or sweep the problem under the rug, a child's emotions and feelings need to be affirmed. For this example, a parent could tell the child that it is understood he or she is upset, but also following up to listen to the reason and offering suggestions for appropriate resolution.
Availability - The last thing we wanted to mention with learning how to stop depression in children specific to prevention is that parents must be available. Taking one minute to hug a child at home after school and work, sitting quietly when a child approaches a parent and wants to chat, and scheduling for quality time are perfect examples of how a parent can be more available.
Treatment Options
The second part of how to stop depression in children is treatment. Before doing anything, the child should be seen by a doctor who could provide a firm diagnosis of depression but also determine its true level of severity. Usually, if a child is suffering from a mild case of depression, certain lifestyle changes and at-home treatments would suffice. In addition, using any of the preventative suggestions listed above would be highly beneficial.
If the degree of depression is considered serious, then treatment would be imperative. Again, under the care of a qualified doctor, the child would be examined and diagnosed, after which time one or more treatment options would be recommended. Following are some examples of treatments on how to stop depression in children . In severe cases, learning how to stop depression in children should always start with a trained doctor, not something parents try to fix on their own. Of course, actual treatment would be on an individual basis since each case is unique.
Counseling - Often, meeting with a child counselor or therapist works great in getting a child to reveal the reason or reasons for feeling depressed. Parents like to think that children tell them everything but as mentioned, this is simply not the case.
Behavioral and/or Cognitive Therapy - These therapies are designed to correct unwanted behaviors and negative thoughts that are often associated with depression.
"Fun" Therapy - Today, children with depression are being treated with unique forms of therapy that have been shown helpful. Usually, children who have withdrawn, have a hard time with expression, or those not responding to more conventional therapies would be ideal candidates. Examples include horseback riding therapy, swimming therapy, and drama therapy. This in combination with the use of natural herbs for depression can work miracles.
Family Therapy - Depression in children is a family affair but all too often, children feel as if they are alone with the way they feel and the problems they are struggling with. When it comes to learning how to stop depression in children, a lot can be said about family therapy and the way it provides support and affirmation to the child.
