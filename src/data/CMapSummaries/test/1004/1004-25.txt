An Overview of Depression
A depressive disorder is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. It affects the way a person eats and sleeps, the way one feels about oneself, and the way one thinks about things. A depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away. People with a depressive illness cannot merely "pull themselves together" and get better. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression.
Major depression is manifested by a combination of symptoms that interfere with the ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy once pleasurable activities. Such a disabling episode of depression may occur only once but more commonly occurs several times in a lifetime. A less severe type of depression, dysthymia, involves long-term, chronic symptoms that do not disable, but keep one from functioning well or from feeling good. Many people with dysthymia also experience major depressive episodes at some time in their lives.

Teens and Depression: Shattering the Myths
Teenagers and adults share a problem: They often fail to recognize the symptoms of depression in themselves or in other people. Further complicating this issue are myths about depression that can separate people from the effective treatments now available. Some of the most common myths are:
Myth: It's normal for teenagers to be moody  teens don't suffer from "real" depression. Fact: Depression can affect people at any age or of any race, ethnic, or economic group.
Myth: Teens who claim to be depressed are weak and just need to pull themselves together. There's nothing anyone else can do to help Fact: Depression is not a weakness, but a serious health disorder. Both young people and adults who are depressed need professional treatment. A trained therapist or counselor can help them learn more positive ways to think about themselves, change behavior, cope with problems, or handle relationships. A physician can prescribe medications to help relieve the symptoms of depression. For many people a combination of psychotherapy and medication is beneficial.
Myth: Talking about depression only makes it worse. Fact: Talking through feelings may help a friend recognize the need for professional help. By showing friendship and concern and giving uncritical support, you can encourage your friend to talk to his or her parents or another trusted adult, like a teacher or coach, about getting treatment. If your friend is reluctant to ask for help, talk to an adult  that's what a real friend will do.
Recognizing Depression
Depression is not something you can just snap out of and feel better; it is a serious illness that needs to be treated. It is not your fault that you are depressed, and you can get better. There are many common signs of depression that indicate a problem. If you have some of these signs that last for more than two weeks, see your health care provider and get help.
* Feeling empty, sad, and anxious. * Feeling tired or having no energy. * Feeling restless and irritable a lot of the time. * Crying more than usual. * Feeling worthless, helpless, hopeless, and guilty. * Having no interest or joy in life. * Having trouble sleeping or waking up very early in the morning. * Having problems eating too much or too little food. * Thinking about suicide and death. * Having trouble concentrating, remembering, and making decisions. * Having physical problems that don't go away when you take medicine, such as headaches, stomach problems, and pains in your body.
