Depression in children
All children "feel blue", from time to time, have a bad day, or are sad. However, when these feelings persist and begin to interfere with a child's ability to function in daily life, depression could be the cause.
Depression is less common in children under 12 years old, but increases after that, affecting 1 in every 20 teenagers.
Depression can lead to academic underachievement, social isolation and create difficult relationships with family & friends.
Depression in children is also associated with an increased risk of suicide.
Symptoms of depression in Children
The symptoms of depression in children and adolescents are similar to adults.
However, sometimes the signs of depression in children and adolescents can be different and may include the following
Finding it hard to concentrate, losing interest in school work and play
Refusing to go to school, or playing truant
Constantly complaining of feeling bored or lonely, even when they have friends
Irritability and moodiness beyond the normal range
Defiance or violent outbursts
Lack of confidence and blaming themselves if things go wrong
Disruptive behaviour at school, bullying, stealing or doing other things that lead to them being punished
Becoming very withdrawn
Self-injury or drinking or taking drugs to excess
Sleeping very little or too much
Younger children may appear to take backwards steps in their development, for example with toilet training or eating.
Many teens with depression abuse alcohol and drugs as a way to numb or manage their pain (self-medicating). If a child or adolescent is abusing substances it would be a good idea to have them evaluated for depression.
In general, medication should only be considered as a first-line course of treatment for children and adolescents who have severe symptoms that would prevent effective psychotherapy; those who are unable to undergo psychotherapy, those with psychosis, and those with chronic or recurrent episodes.
