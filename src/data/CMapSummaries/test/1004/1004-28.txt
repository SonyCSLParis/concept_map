Children by Karen K. Brees, Ph.D.
No two children act the same, and that is what makes childhood such an adventure for both parents and children. Parents and grandparents keep careful note of these developmental milestones and proudly share them with anyone who'll listen! The other milestones, however, those irritating and annoying phases that children go through, sometimes aren't phases at all, but signs of a depressive disorder. How's a parent to know the difference?
Children can suffer from many of the same depressive disorders as adults. Many conditions, including major depression and bipolar disorder, tend to run in families. Mood swings in children with bipolar disorder tend to be more rapid than in adults. Children in the manic phase tend to be irritable and throw temper tantrums rather than experiencing extreme happiness. So, it can be extremely difficult to diagnose depression in children, but generally, behavioral changes offer some clues. Symptoms of depression in children can cover a wide range of territory:
Marked changes in behavior
Listlessness, lack of energy
Bouts of crying that seem endless
Neglecting school work or hobbies
Temper tantrums, yelling, shouting
Withdrawal from friends
Marked changes in eating habits
Feeling that nobody likes him or her
Complaints of headaches or stomach aches or other aches, in order to avoid school or other social situations
Sleep problems
Diagnosis and Treatment Options
The key to detecting depression in children is change. If you notice changes in your child's behavior, and if those changes continue or worsen, it's important to contact your child's pediatrician to first rule out an underlying physical cause.
It is not normal for a child to have recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Always take seriously a child's comments about such things and act quickly to get help. Once you have consulted your pediatrician or general practitioner, he may then refer you to a social worker, child psychologist, or child psychiatrist.
It's always frightening for a parent when a child experiences illness, and mental illness is doubly scary. Your first tendency is to think that somehow you've failed, done something wrong, or been bad parents. Think of depression as you would any other medical condition. Some families have a tendency toward high blood pressure or diabetes. Depression is no different. It's just another illness - and, it's treatable.
Childhood depression usually responds well to proper treatment. Children with bipolar disorder are generally treated with lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine. Other medications may also be prescribed. If the depression has developed as the result of a trauma or abuse, children may benefit from play therapy. In play therapy, your child has the opportunity to work out difficult feelings through role-play, arts and crafts, or other expressive means, while in a safe environment. Your child will attend sessions on a regular basis, perhaps weekly, for a period of time. Play therapy will help your child build confidence and better peer and family relationships. In addition, the family as a whole can also benefit from counseling, to help them through this difficult time.
As a parent, you have a right to ask questions and be informed about every step of your child's treatment, and you should do so. The stakes here are too high not to be included in the information loop. If you don't understand something, ask to have it explained in language you can understand. Be persistent until you are comfortable that you know everything that's going on and what to expect. You and your health care professionals are a team, working together, to help your child.
