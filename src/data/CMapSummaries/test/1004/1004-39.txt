When you are a parent, you will do just about anything to inspire happiness in your child. From the time your child is born, you are delighted with your child's toothless grin and easy giggles. All emotions, from happiness to anger to surprise, are a normal part of your child's existence. Sadness is normal emotion, too, for your child. However, if feelings of sadness or unhappiness persist for your child in a way that you feel is abnormal, you may be witnessing the symptoms of depression in children.
Even though it may hurt you to see sadness in your child, sadness is a typical response to a negative experience such as loss or rejection. Feelings of unhappiness, however, are not normal if they are out of proportion with the event, or if the sadness persists for no apparent reason. Parents should be aware of the symptoms of depression in children, just in case they notice those symptoms in their own children or other children they come into contact with. A list of the common symptoms of depression in children is similar to depression in adults, as follows:
Crying and feeling helpless or hopeless
Feelings of overwhelming sadness, worthlessness, and guilt
Losing interest in activities that normally brought pleasure such as sports, TV, video games, and playing with friends
Changes in appetite, whether increased or decreased
Significant weight changes
Inability to sleep or sleeping too much
Lack of energy and low physical activity
Aggressive or antisocial behavior
Suicidal thoughts and fantasies
Bad temper and irritability
Feelings of fear and anxiety
Negative change in school performance
Complaints of physical pain such as stomach aches, headaches, and muscle aches
Estimates show that the symptoms of depression in children occur in 1 to 2 percent of children from ages 1 to 6, and up to 12 percent of children from ages 9 through adolescence. The medical community is not entirely sure exactly what causes depression, but the symptoms of depression in children may be linked to negative life experiences, personality traits, genetics, underactive thyroid, imbalance in neurotransmitters, and other medical conditions. The symptoms of depression in children may also be classified into different types such as major depression, separation anxiety, or adjustment disorder. Since the symptoms of depression in children can have life-altering consequences for the child and the family, depression is a condition that should always be addressed seriously and immediately.
