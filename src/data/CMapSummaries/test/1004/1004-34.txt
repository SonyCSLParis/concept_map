Welcome to The Mental Health Association of Westchester County, Inc. Our mission is to promote mental health in Westchester County, New York, through advocacy, community education and direct services.
Depression is a word sometimes used to describe the sadness people, including children and adolescents, feel when things go wrong in their everyday lives. It is also a word used to describe a serious mental illness involving sadness and despair, feelings of hopelessness, and often physical symptoms which interfere with everyday life. This kind of depression is called Clinical Depression. We will use the term Clinical Depression when discussing it on this site. When you read about Clinical Depression in other places, it may simply be called Depression.
Clinical Depression affects children and adolescents as well as adults. About eight percent of teenagers and two and a half percent of children have Clinical Depression. Clinical Depression in children and adolescents is often not recognized because their symptoms are not always like those of adults. The signs of Clinical Depression that are the same in adults and young people include:
Intense feelings of sadness, despair and worthlessness
Crying spells
Lack of interest in being with friends
An increase or decrease in sleeping and/or eating
Feeling tired all the time
Frequent unclear physical complaints (for example, headaches or stomach aches)
Thoughts of death and/or suicide (Read more on Suicide in Children/Adolescents to learn the warning signs, who is at risk, how you can help and for other information.)
The signs of Clinical Depression that are often present in children and adolescents, but not so often in adults include:
Misbehaving, being very irritable and angry
Arguing and fighting
Being bored most of the time
Failing grades in school
Reckless behavior
In Clinical Depression, some or all of these symptoms happen almost every day over a period of two weeks or more. Clinical Depression is a serious illness that can interfere with a child's or adolescent's functioning at home, at school and with friends. Some children and adolescents with Clinical Depression are at risk for suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 10-18 year olds.
What causes Clinical Depression?
Clinical Depression tends to run in families. Research shows that changes in brain chemistry are associated with Clinical Depression. It can be triggered by a life crisis, such as the death of someone close, an illness or a serious accident. Clinical Depression may also occur without any obvious cause.
How can Clinical Depression Be Treated?
Clinical Depression in children and adolescents can be treated successfully. Treatment is especially important because of the risk of suicide associated with Clinical Depression. Treatments include play therapy for younger children, talking therapies (or counseling) for older children and adolescents, and medications. A combination of these kinds of treatments is often effective. Family therapy may be helpful, as well as changes in the young person's home and school environments to reduce stress. For many children and adolescents, Clinical Depression will recur even after successful treatment, and it will need to be treated again.
The biggest problem with Clinical Depression in children and adolescents is that it is not recognized and thus these young people do not get the treatment they need.
