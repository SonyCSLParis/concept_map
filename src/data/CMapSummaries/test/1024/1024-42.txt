A majority of Canadians think bullying should be considered a crime, according to a new poll.
An Angus Reid online survey of 1,006 Canadian adults found that two-thirds of respondents believe bullying should be punishable by law, even if no physical violence is involved.
One in five, or 19 per cent, said bullying should be labelled a crime only if someone is physically hurt. Only six per cent of respondents didn't think it was necessary to criminalize bullying, and 10 per cent said they weren't sure how they felt.
The poll was released on National Pink Shirt Day, a campaign that encouraged students across Canada to wear something pink on Wednesday and take a stand against bullying.
Bullying is not an offence under the Criminal Code of Canada, but certain behaviours associated with it -- such as harassment and uttering threats -- are.
The Angus Reid poll found overwhelming support for legislation specifically targeting cyber-bullying. Ninety per cent of those surveyed said it should be illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."
A proposed federal law in the United States is aiming to do just that.
"We were a bit surprised by the high level of support for cyber-bullying laws," Mario Canseco, vice-president of Angus Reid Public Opinion, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview Wednesday. "It's very hard to get 90 per cent of Canadians to agree on anything."
Most of the survey participants said bullying is a serious problem in Canada's elementary, middle and high schools. The majority felt that bullying gets more intense and dangerous as students get older.
More than half said that bullying continues later in life, both at work and at home.
Support for anti-bullying legislation was especially high in Quebec, as well as among women and people over the age of 55, the poll found.
"There is a little bit of hesitance over this from a legislative point, but I think this survey shows Canadians are ready to accept (bullying) as a serious crime," Canseco said.
Ontario's Liberal government has proposed legislation that would require school officials to report serious bullying incidents and allow them to suspend or expel students who harass their classmates. The Accepting Schools Act would also introduce new bullying prevention and intervention policies.
Similar legislation was tabled in Quebec, where the government is also seeking to appoint anti-bullying guardians in schools.

Anti-Bullying Peter - fully agree with you that it starts at home, and it's up to parents to teach their kids what is right from wrong - however, this is not always the case. Instilling a law regarding bullying will maybe force parents to actually do their job, or they should pay the consequences. I was bullied once, on a bus in elementary school, and I just ignored them; those same boys tried to be my friend in high school, and now, where do you think these guys are? Going absolutely nowhere in life. Bullies are losers, and so are their parents. That's it.
kat Bullying - the new most misused word in the english language. There is a difference between conflict and bullying - just WHO would be the one to decide and convict some one of the supposed crime. Perhaps the media - they are great at it!
LMG Personally, I believe that not only should the bully be punished, but the crappy parents, too for raising the bully. Maybe then parents will start to take it seriously when someone tells them that their child is a terror.
LMG Lack of parenting may be at the root of the problem, but also are the parents of the bullies who think their children are "angels" despite how much evidence to the contrary.Making bullying illegal and punishable by law is important as it provides victims of bullying a way to fight back reasonably, even if the bully's parents are in denial.
Ian VanBeek Bullying sucks but alot of things suck in life. Why do we insist that we have to protect everyone from everything. Lets keep the cops out of eachother lives and when an issue comes up talk it out like good caring canadians.
Myles Peter - One thing that has changed is that teachers have their hands tied with respect to discipline, so the adults who have the most daily contact with kids have little recourse to change these patterns even if they do notice them early.
Lisa I fully agree with Peter. Lack of parenting is the problem. As a teacher with 15 years experience, it has become unbearable to teach these little delinquents. If parents don't step up, we will have to plan to add space in prisons for this generation.
ross A crime? Sure it should be a crime. But the reality is that child molesters and murderers sometimes get off free, how can the courts look after this serious problem if they cannot do their jobs now?
Alex A child who is raised properly will not become a bully, it's that simple. But, since so many parents seem incapable of fulfilling this obligation of theirs to society, anti-bullying legislation would be a positive step. Not the ultimate solution, but still a positive step.
Roadrobber Yes, indeed. Punish those who bully and call people bad names and hurt their feelings. Prison time for 5 year olds. It's about time.
SaskNewfie I agree with what you're saying, to a point. Yes, it's mostly the parents' fault. However, what about the kids whose parents don't care enough to enforce a little discipline? These kids are bullying other kids to the point that they have to switch schools...some even commit suicide over this. My daughter had to change schools twice due to bullying. I have friends whose kids are relentlessly bullied. Kids are nasty when the want...they'll cry and say they won't do it again, but as soon as they meet their victim in the hallway, they pounce. Schools wont' do anything in a lot of cases. Parents of bullies won't do anything in most cases. Parents of victims are left with hands tied...what do they do? They can't bully back...they can't force the other parents to sort their kids out. And yes, bullying has changed today. Kids can alter any photo they want and with the click of a button have it emailed out to hundreds of recipients. With social networking, bullying is easier than ever. Education is the key...kids need to know how they're impacting the lives of those they taunt and ridicule. To do this, the support of our education system is needed...law enforcement support is needed...and of course, support from home is needed.
firstMickey Kick the school bullies out. Let their parents live with the monster they have raised. Work bullies are no fun either. We had one guy who scratched himself in appropriately whenever he had a secretary in his office with the door closed. We had another fellow who talked meanly. I fixed his clock 2 weeks after I started working there. I told him to stick his job. He immediately reformed because he knew I meant business.
soconnor The most effectively way to decrease bullying in schools is to instruct the teachers and administration to do the following: When a student victim retaliates towards a bully (be it verbally or physically) it is important the the adults turn a blind eye to this action. Dealing with his or her bully causes a mutual respect between the two personalities (they may not like one another, but a boundary has been drawn which both are now aware of). It is very effective for student victims to stand up for themselves because it is out of their nature to do so, and once they have, they are no longer an easy target for bullying. Repremanding the victim for being brave enough to stand up against their bully only causes deep frustration and a thwarting of their movement towards being bully-free.
Raymond Actually I thought it was a crime, if I push you around could you have me charged with assault? I just don't think anyone or child with witness' have tried to have a bully charged with at least some kind of charge. This would set a precedent
I'd actually check this out with a lawyer, also I do remember; now that I think of it; a kid in our school was charged years ago for assaulting a teacher Just my thoughts
maureen coffey Obviously Mr Peter in BC has never had to deal personally with bullies. When the school does not do anything the parents have only one recourse, pull you kid from the school. Parents are not at the schools to see what is happening to the kids. While sometimes the parent may be to blame, this is not the main cause.
Durward Define bullying! Physical assault is already a crime. This is another attempt to limit free expression/speach. Without an iron clad definition of bullying it could mean anything, which equals more oppression and less freedom or the state bullying the citizen. Is belittling someone's religion bullying? is disagreeing with Suzuki? We don't need more laws, we just need the laws we have now respected.
NE Bullying a crime ? How about hockey antics ? I have a son in Peewee where hitting is allowed - take the puck or the player. Is that not condoned bullying ? Our team has had 4 concussions &amp; a broken collarbone this year. These are 11 &amp; 12 year olds. Where is Hockey Canada on this issue ? No wonder why hockey numbers are dropping dramatically.
peter in BC Perhaps if parents did a better job at parenting rather than catering to their kids there would be less bullying in the school yards. But let's face it, bullying has been around for generations and it's no different today than it was 3 generations ago. If the parents bring their child up with rules, punishment and consequences, then they would be better kids. Don't look to the government to make stupid laws, look from within to raise better kids. I see it all the time around my home when parents say "get in the house" and the kid mouths off at the parent. What does the parent do? Nothing. While I despised my parents for punishing me, it made me a better person as a whole. Today's parents are the problem, not the kids, not the government, not the schools. Accept responsibility for your kids, punish them as required (time-outs do nothing to make a kid learn) and you'll find you have a better kid overall. I put the blame squarely on the parents.
Five years ago a boy in N.S. wore a pink shirt to school and became a target for bullying. A few years later on Wednesday thousands of Canadians wore pink and Seamus O'Regan discusses the grassroots movement.
Students in Brandon, Winnipeg and other Manitoba cities and towns donned pink attire, put pink colouring in their hair or painted themselves pink, all in the hopes of sending a message aimed at stopping bullying. Josh Crabb reports.
