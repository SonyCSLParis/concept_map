What's the parents' role in addressing online safety?
Ask your kids about their online social life. They will be more likely to speak to you about cyberbullying or online harassment if there is an ongoing dinner-table conversation about online safety issues. Also remember that when if comes to online bullying or harassment, children are often just as likely to be the perpetrators as they are the victims, and can sometimes go back and forth between the two roles during one incident. The child may not even realize that he or she is doing something wrong.
One way to start a family conversation about online safety is for parents to enter into a family online safety contract with their kids. These contracts (examples are provided on our Family Online Safety Contract page) allow parents and kids to define internet usage rules for the family. They are most effective when parents and kids work through the rules together. Kids who agree to participate in the process will know what is expected of them and what is acceptable or unacceptable online, and they will better understand parents' obligations to protect their children from certain types of online conduct.
If a child is the victim of cyberbullying or online harassment, parents can take steps ranging from providing love and support to the child and talking with school counselors to reporting the abuse to law enforcement authorities. There are two things parents should consider before anything else:
(1) Is your child at risk of physical harm or assault? And
(2) how are they handling the attacks emotionally?
In all instances, parents should take steps to keep a record of the harassment or cyberbullying activity. If any threats are made to a child, or there is any indication that personal contact information has been posted online, parents should report the incident to a local law enforcement agency and include a print-out of any instances of cyberbullying they have recorded.
