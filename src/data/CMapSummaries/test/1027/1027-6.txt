Connecting Generations - Protecting Yourself and Your Kids Online
Did you know that the 7 th February was, in fact, Safer Internet Day, an annual event organised by the European Union's Insafe network ? Its aim is to promote a safe online environment for all, and this year's focus was on "Connecting Generations" or how families can "discover the digital world together... safely." Coincidentally and very aptly, it was also the day #dear14yearoldself was trending on Twitter. I took a moment to reflect on my own Internet-related past to see whether attitudes have changed since I was at my most vulnerable - the early teenage years.
Alarmingly, a survey by youth research specialist Dubit revealed 44 per cent of British children aged 8 to 12 are ignoring Facebook's age limit of 13 and routinely checking into the social networking site. An Ipsos MORI poll discovered 80 per cent of children in the UK, aged 5 to 15, are regular Internet users. The research found parents are scared of technology while their children are embracing it.
What worries me is how easy it now is for children to access the Internet. I really admire those parents who resist their child's tantrums and peer pressure-induced pleas for access to the newest technology. Unfortunately, that's not stopping him or her from going online on a friend's smart phone or a public computer.
I got my first computer at the age of 15 when my parents deemed me "sensible enough" to have one and when teachers started to request typed essays instead of terribly handwritten ones. Prior to that, I was only allowed to use dad's computer when he didn't need it himself. The new computer's location in my room didn't stop mum from regularly checking in on me to see what I was doing. I hated it and plead guilty to minimising many chat windows (MSN Messenger was still cool back then) as soon as I heard footsteps outside the door. In hindsight (#dear15yearoldself), I realise that I'm actually really grateful to her for it. By "prying", mum was making sure I stayed in the online "safe zone". I'm proud to say she was quite ahead of her time even though she did little more online than writing e-mails. But in the early noughties, internet safety wasn't the focus of international awareness days, conferences and other campaigns. The first Safer Internet Day took place in 2004, whereas in the UK, the Get Safe Online Initiative was not launched until 2005.
Personally, I'm grateful to companies like TalkTalk for introducing parental controls that require mums and dads to choose whether they want to block any sensitive content - gambling, gaming, suicide, social networking, dating, porn, and weapons and violence - before activating their account.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating internet censorship. I'm worried how most published information reaches so much further than its intended target audience. It's always been a parent's responsibility to look after their child's safety offline so why should it be any different online?
Now, however, roles are changing and developing. Sometimes I'm the one giving mum advice on what to be wary of online as she's learnt to while away her time going on Google tangents. "Don't click on random links sent to you from unknown e-mail addresses," I preach, to keep her from infecting her computer with an incurable virus. "Don't be tempted to accept the "congratulations, you're our 1000 th visitor" prize! It's all a con."
I'm a keen advocate for initiatives like Safer Internet Day that spread a valuable message in very simple terms. "Discover the digital world together... safely!" As children are exposed to the Internet ever the more early on in life, and as elder generations start exploring the virtual world, kids, parents and grandparents should actively talk about the Internet and not be afraid to tell each other to be careful.

2012-02-26 16:17:52 - Kids Safety On The Internet
"Have you listened to what they have to say?" is one of the key ingredients to keeping your kids safe on the Internet. I am a firm believer that parents need to be actively involved with their kids in order to guide them properly through Internet land. Kids are more than happy to teach their parents and parents can also teach (aka guide) their kids. I have taught many parents the bite sized pieces of technical and non technical information they need to be effective, and it is interesting to note that parents anxiety and stress levels are reduced significantly after they get up to speed. Kid/Parent involvement and sharing can be made fun too. Thanks for sharing this information with the community.

Thanks for your contribution! Very happy to hear this topic is getting more and more attention these days. Also, good to hear parents have been open to learning. Do you run classes or is it one-to-one teaching?
