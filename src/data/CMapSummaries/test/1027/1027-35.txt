Internet Safety Guide for New Hampshire Parents and Teens
Attorney General Ayotte Releases Internet Safety Guide and a Web Site, "Connect With Your Kids.org" for Parents and Kids Recent Arrests Underscore Importance of Safety Guide
(Concord, NH) - Attorney General Kelly Ayotte today released her office's new Internet Safety Guide for Parents and Teens, a 56-page booklet that addresses the dangers of online predators, offering advice to parents on how to protect their children and to teens on how to protect themselves. The booklet is part of the Attorney General's internet safety program called "Connect with Your Kids". The Attorney General hopes to meet with parents and students from across the State in the coming months.
Attorney General Ayotte said, "The dangers of the Internet led my office to produce this important and informative guide. It teaches both teens and parents how to recognize and deal with online dangers. A Justice Department survey of youths ages 10 to 17 tells us that one in seven children have received a sexual solicitation while on the Internet and over half of those children chose not to tell anyone about it."
"I don't want anyone's child to become a victim." said Ayotte, "That's why I look forward to getting this information to parents and children across New Hampshire. I want to encourage moms and dads take time out of their busy day to "Connect with Your Kids" and talk with them about Internet safety. My office's Internet Safety booklet will open their eyes to the methods used by cyber predators to make contact with children both online and in real life. Being proactive is critical."
The booklet teaches parents the warning signs that indicate their child may become victim to a cyber predator, how predators "groom" a potential victim, and the possible consequences of online activities. Teens will learn how to choose safe on-screen names, how to spot a potential predator's advances, and what information they should never fill out online.
The booklet is available from the Connect with Your Kids Web site that is a resource for parents. By logging on to www.connectwithyourkids.org parents can download the booklet and other presentations concerning online child safety.
The release of the Attorney General's Internet Safety Guide coincides with the arrests of child predators by the Hillsborough Task Force. Yesterday, the Southern Hillsborough County Cybercrime Task Force announced the arrest of numerous child predators.
Attorney General Ayotte noted, "these cases highlight that cyber predators pose a real threat to our children. I highly recommend that New Hampshire parents download or pick up a copy of my Internet Safety Guide to learn more about the dangers of the Internet and how to teach your children to protect themselves online."
Copies of Attorney General Ayotte's Internet Safety Guide are available from the Connect With Your Kids Web site www.connectwithyourkids.org or by calling the Department of Justice at 603-271-1202.
