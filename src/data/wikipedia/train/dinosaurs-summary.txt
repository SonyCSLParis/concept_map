Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.
They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 245 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research.
They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassicâ€“Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
