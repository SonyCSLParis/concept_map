Introduction about Chalukya Dynasty The chalukya dynasty was a very popular dynasty.
It was a royal dynasity that ruled southern and central India through the 6th to the 12th century.
During this period, they ruled as three related, but individual dynasties.The earliest dynasty known as the Badmi Chalukyas ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century.
In 550 Pulakesi I established the Chalukya dynasty.
He took Vatapi (Badami in Bagalkot district, Karnataka) under his control and made it his capital.The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakesi II (609 â€“ 642) C.E.
After the death of Pulakesi II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan.
They ruled from their capital Vengi until about the 11th century.
In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in late 10th century.
These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) till the end of the 12th century.During the rule of the Chalukyas it was known as the Golden Age.
Development The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas.
For the first time, a South Indian kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers.
The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called â€œChalukyan architectureâ€.
Kannada literature, which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the Jain and Veerashaiva traditions.
The 11th century saw the birth of Telugu literature under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas.

DeclinePulakesi II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and halted the southward march of Harsha by defeating him on the banks of the river Narmada.
He then defeated the Vishnukundins in the southeastern Deccan.
Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory by attacking and occupying the Chalukya capital Vatapi (Badami).
The Badami Chalukya dynasty went in to a brief decline following the death of Pulakesi II due to internal feuds.
It recovered during the reign of Vikramaditya I, who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire.
The empire reached a peak during the rule of the illustrious Vikramaditya II who defeated the Pallava Nandivarman II and captured Kanchipuram.
After the rise of the Rashtrakutas the Chalukyas of Badami went in to an eclipse to be recovered in the tenth century C.E. by Tailapa II (973 â€“ 997) C.E.
These later Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani.
They were in constant conflict with the Imperial Cholas over the control of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom of Vengi.
The Western Chalukyan power finally succumbed to the Hoysalas and Yadavas after almost three hundred years of glory.
Somesvara IV (1184 â€“ 1200 C.E.) was the last known Chalukyan ruler.
