Chalukya Dynasty: The Mighty Rulers of Southern and Central India
Large parts of Southern and Central India were under the reign of the Chalukya Dynasty between 6th and 12th Century.
Literary documents like Gada Yudda written by Ranna, one of the three gems of the Kannada Literature and Vikramankadeva Charitam by Bilhana, an 11th century Kashmiri poet state that the Chalukya Dynasty was not a single empire instead there were three different empires ruling under the same name.
However, the Badami Chalukyas are the oldest of the three.
It was the most famous Chalukya King- Pulakesi -2 under whose rule the Badami Chalukyas rose to prominence.
With the rule of the Chalukya Dynasty South India saw the golden age of trade, commerce and architecture.
Kannada and Telugu Literature also flourished under the Chalukyas.
Kannada developed as an important language along with Sanskrit at this time.
The Chalukya architecture was a fusion of the Northern and Southern style of architectures.
The Nagara style of Northern Indian architecture got mixed with the Dravida Style of the Southern India.
Origin of the Chalukya Dynasty
Several theories have been stated with respect to the origin of the Chalukya Dynasty.
However, the most reliable sources are the inscriptions found over the period of time.
The Badami cave inscriptions of Mangalesa 578 CE , Kappe Arabhatta record of 700 CE, Peddavaduguru inscription of Pulakesi II, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of Vikramaditya II are some of the popular inscriptions to give hints about the origin of the Badami Chalukyas.
Several travelogues of the foreign travelers making a reference to the Chalukyan Empire have added to the information on the Chalukyan Empire.
HsÃ¼an-tsang (Xuanzang), a Chinese traveler in one of his record Aihole gives a description of the prosperous and well managed Chalukyan Empire under Pulakesi II.
Periods in the Chalukyan History
Badami Chalukyas
Pulakesi 1 established his rule in the Vatapi (Badami) area of the South India in present day Karnataka and eventually extended his rule to the northern extents of the Pallava Kingdom.
They also ruled most parts of Andhra Pradesh along with entire Karnataka.
Pulakesi -2 then extended the Chalukya kingdom by gaining control of the South-Eastern Deccan.
Pulakesi died fighting Pallava King, Narasimhavarman who attacked him in 642 CE.
The Badami Chalukyas went into a period of decline following the death of Pulakesi.
After thirteen years of Pallava Rule, The Cholkayas came to the power with the reign of Vikramaditya-1 who initiated the prosperous times for the Chalukyas.
His legacy was carried forward by the Chalukyan Kings Vijayaditya and Vikramaditya-2.
During this period, the Chalukyas defeated rulers from all the powerful kingdoms- the Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras.
Defeat of the Chalukya King- Kirtivarman-2 at the hands of the Rashtrakuta King Dantidurga in 753 CE marked the end of the rule of Badami Chalukyas.
Chalukyas of Kalyani or Western Chalukyas
The Chalukya rule was revived in 973 CE, almost after 200 years of subjugation at the hands of the Rashtrakuta Kings.
Tailapa-2 who was a feudatory the Rashtrakutas captured much of the Westren Deccan and established the Chalukya Empire again.

Chalukyas of Vengi
After the end of the rule of the Badami Chalukyas, The battle for rule was initiated between the Rashtrakutas, the Western Chalukyas and the Eastern Chalukyasand Eastern Chalukyas were dominated by the Rashtrakutas at this time except for the time when Bhima-1( Eastern Chalukyan King) ruled.
After his demise, the Rashtrakutas gained control of Vengi again.
After the death of Darnarnava, the Eastern Chalukyan King, the Telugu king Bhima ruled the Vengi region for over 23 years and the two sons of Darnavarna were given a shelter by the Cholas in their Kingdom.
This helped them form an alliance with the Cholas and with their assistance Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000 CE though the original control lied with the Chola King Rajaraja Chola 1.
