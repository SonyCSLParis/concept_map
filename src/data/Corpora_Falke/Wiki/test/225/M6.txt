India Badami ChalukyasAD 543 - 753
The Chalukyas formed a powerful dynasty which was founded by Pulakeshi I, who originated from a place called Vatapi (now known as Badami, in Bagalkot, Karnataka state).
At its height between the sixth and twelfth centuries the Chalukya kingdom ruled large areas of central and southern India, mostly towards the western coast.
During this period, they ruled as three related, but individual dynasties.
The earliest dynasty, known as the 'Badami Chalukyas', ruled from their capital at Vatapi from the middle of the sixth century.
The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence when theÂ KadambaÂ kingdom of Banavasi declined, and they rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshi II.
The dynasty was previously thought by some scholars to have migrated from Central Asia, a relative of Iraq's Seleukiya tribe, but that idea has since been rejected.
The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of southern India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka.
The political atmosphere in southern India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of the Badami Chalukyas.
For the first time, a southern Indian kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and Narmada rivers.
The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce, and the development of a new style of architecture called 'Chalukyan architecture'.
