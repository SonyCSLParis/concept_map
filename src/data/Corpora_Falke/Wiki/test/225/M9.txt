Rashtrakuta Dynasty
The Rashtrakuta Dynasty (Sanskrit: à¤°à¤¾à¤·à¥à¤Ÿà¥à¤°à¤•à¥‚à¤Ÿ rÄá¹£á¹­rakÅ«á¹­a, Kannada: à²°à²¾à²·à³à²Ÿà³à²°à²•à³‚à²Ÿ) had been a royal Indian dynasty ruling large parts of southern, central and northern India between the sixth and the thirteenth centuries.
During that period they ruled as several closely related, but individual clans.
The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription comes from a seventh century copper plate grant that mentions their rule from Manpur in the Malwa region of modern Madhya Pradesh.
Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions had been the kings of Achalapur, modern Elichpur in Maharashtra and the rulers of Kannauj.
Several controversies exist regarding the origin of those early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language.
The clan that ruled from Elichpur had been a feudatory of the Badami Chalukyas and during the rule of Dantidurga, it overthrew Chalukya Kirtivarman II and went on to build an impressive empire with the Gulbarga region in modern Karnataka as its base.
That clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, rising to power in South India in 753.
At the same time the Pala Dynasty of Bengal and the Prathihara dynasty of Gujarat gained force in eastern and northwestern India respectively.
That period, between the eight and the tenth centuries, saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of those three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time.
At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganga River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions.
The early kings of that dynasty had been Hindu but Jainism strongly influenced the later kings.
During their rule, Jain mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in Kannada and Sanskrit.
Amoghavarsha I emerged as the most famous king of that dynasty, writing Kavirajamarga, a landmark literary work in the Kannada language.
Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest examples appearing in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora and the sculptures of Elephanta Caves in modern Maharashtra as well as in the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
