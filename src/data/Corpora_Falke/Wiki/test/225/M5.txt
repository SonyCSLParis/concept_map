Gifts from the Chalukyas
Almost around the time when the Guptas were creating architectural heritage in northern India, another purposeful movement was taking place in the Deccanâ€”a group of robust structures evolved from an earlier tradition of rock-cut shrines and came to be known as experiments in Brahmanical worship.
Text & photographs by HAIMANTI DEYIN traditional historical narration, much of the history of ancient Indian architecture is preoccupied with the Gupta period.
There is a marked cultural ignorance of the ancient Deccan in popular reading.
Events happening largely in northern India have been written about for long, with the south receiving a marginal narrative.
While Brahmanical sources are engaged with northern and central India, the other regions remain in the periphery; the south remains almost a blank.
Almost around the time when the Guptas were creating architectural heritage in northern India, a purposeful movement was taking place in the Deccanâ€”a group of robust structures evolved from an earlier tradition of rock-cut shrines and came to be known as experiments in Brahmanical worship.
This was the work of the rapidly rising imperial regime of the Early Chalukyas.
Their first efforts are found in the temples at Aihole in Karnataka, built between 450 C.E. and 650 C.E.; the majority of them are Brahmanical and some are Jain.
The first Hindu structural temples are believed to have been part of this movement.
Unlike the contemporary Gupta structures, which were spread over a large area, the Chalukyan group was confined to a small region.
After about two centuries of vigorous temple-building experiments, the temple construction movement shifted to Pattadakal, a World Heritage site in Karnataka.
Here, a later style developed.
Brief history
Under the patronage of the Early Chalukya rulers, experimentation in temple buildingâ€”planning, art and architectureâ€”started around the fifth century C.E. in Aihole, Pattadakal and some other places.
It was Pulakesin I who shifted his capital from Aihole to Vatapi (Badami).
From the middle of the sixth century, and for almost 200 years, the Chalukyas of Badami held power over northern Deccan.
Around the same time, a group of cave temples at Badami was sculpted under the Chalukya rulers.
The Chinese traveller Hiuen-tsang, who visited the Chalukyan empire in 639 C.E., mentioned Pulakesin II (610-642 C.E.) as a conqueror of the Deccan.
Badami remained the Chalukya capital for almost two hundred years, from 540 C.E. to 757 C.E.
