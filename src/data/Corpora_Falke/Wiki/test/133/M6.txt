“Cloud Gate is the tops”5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2015
Cloud Gate, located within the Millennium Park area of the Loop community in down-town Chicago has to be one of the top, free, public interactive sculptures in the world.
No-one can resist gazing at their reflection, taking photographs, and group 'selfies' as they wander around this attraction.
This attraction brings out the child in everyone.
