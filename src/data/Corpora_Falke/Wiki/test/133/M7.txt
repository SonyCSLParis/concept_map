Difficulty: 1.5 out of 5Terrain: 1.5 out of 5Geocache Description:Cloud Gate:Is lovingly known as the Bean in Chicago and is one of the main attractions at Millennium Park.
It's a monumental public sculpture by Anish Kapoor which weighs in at 110 tons.
Named Cloud Gate by the artist, it's a stainless steel sculpture designed to reflect the Chicago skyline, the new park and everything around it.
The sculpture has been unveiled but is still being buffed out.
Currently the seams are visible but when finished it will be a seamless reflection of the Chicago Skyline and anyone standing nearby.
You can view Cloud Gate (visit link) by web cam and see some magnificent views of the sculpture and Millennium Park.
To get credit for this cache:You must take a photograph of Cloud Gate (aka the Bean) with your reflection in the picture.
Your face must be clear enough to identify that it is you.
It took me two tries to get a picture so that my face wasn't hidden by the camera so, be sure to think about your face, and your camera... and for artistic reasons think about what else is in the reflection.
You might want to pick a specific building or sculpture to be in the picture with you or, you might prefer to have someone or something else in the picture with you.
Just make sure it's a reflection of you off the mirrored surface of Cloud Gate and oddly enough if it's your backside in the reflection and you are in the foreground that does meet the requirements.
