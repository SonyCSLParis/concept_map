“The Jellybean!”
4 of 5 stars Reviewed 2 weeks ago via mobile
Everyone pictures the jellybean when they hear Chicago and Anish Kapoors art does not disappoint!
It looks great with the city in the background and is fun to go see.
Try and go early of a bit later because at 12 you'll hit a rush of people and will be taking pictures of strangers heads alllll day!
