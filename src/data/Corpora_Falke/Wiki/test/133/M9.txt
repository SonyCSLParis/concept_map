“Touristy, but great!”
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2014
Of course a restaurant located directly under Cloud Gate (The Bean!)
is going to be a tourist hot spot.
I was hesitant to go because of this.
I was expecting an overcrowded and overpriced experience at Park Grill, but ultimately choose it for dinner with friends who were coming in on the Metra to Millennium Station.
It was conveniently located and accepted reservations.
We had a reservation through Open Table and were seated immediately in a great booth near a window.
The meal service was a bit slow, but the food was great.
Everyone in my party was happy with their meals (we had a few of the salad options, a Park Grill burger, truffle fries, and calamari).
Though we ate inside, I was admiring the patio.
It would be perfect in the spring and early summer!
I can image that they get extremely busy, so I recommend making a reservation.
If you're staying on Michigan Avenue, this location really can't be beat.
Stop here for dinner after visiting the Art Institute, then go upstairs and see the Bean!
