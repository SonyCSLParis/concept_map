THE PARKOn July 16, 2004, the City of Chicago formally opened Millennium Park.
The 24.5-acre park is located at the northwest corner of Grant Park and provides an impressive park setting where residents and visitors can admire gardens, watch a performing arts presentation or listen to a concert performance.
Millennium Park's design includes the Jay Pritzker Pavilion - a performing arts pavilion designed by internationally renowned architect Frank Gehry, as well as the AT&T Plaza featuring Anish Kapoor's 110-ton Cloud Gate sculpture.
Commonly known as "the Bean", the sculpture is forged of a series of highly polished stainless steel plates, which reflect the city's famous skyline and the clouds above.
The Crown Fountain, designed by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, features two 50-foot-high glass block towers projecting the faces of 1,000 Chicagoans as water gushes from their mouths into a shallow reflecting pool.
In addition, the Park showcases many other works of public art, fountains, landscaped walkways and green space.
