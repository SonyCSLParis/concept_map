Irredentist forces from Mexico try to take back Texas
On this day in 1842, Mexican general Adrián Woll, with a force of 12,000 men, captured the city of San Antonio.
Woll's expedition was part of the continued skirmishing that went on between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War.
Woll's army was repulsed by Texan troops in the battle of Salado Creek on September 18, evacuated San Antonio two days later, and returned to Coahuila.
The Mexican government hailed Woll's Texas campaign as a success, promoted him to major general, and awarded him its Cross of Honor.
Texans responded to the attack by launching the Somervell and Mier expeditions.

Another chapter in Texas HistoryADRIÁN WOLL (1795–1875).
Adrián Woll, Mexican general, was born on December 2, 1795, in St. Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, educated for the military profession, and served as a lieutenant in a lancer regiment in the imperial guard during the First Empire.
In 1815 he was a captain adjutant major in the Tenth Legion of the National Guard of the Seine.
On the restoration of Bourbon rule in France, Woll sailed for America, carrying letters of introduction to Gen. Winfield Scott, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.
Scott apparently pointed to the opportunities that the Mexican revolutionary movement in progress against Spain offered a young man of energy, skilled in the military arts.
On July 3, 1816, in Baltimore, Woll joined the staff of Gen. Francisco Xavier Mina as a lieutenant colonel.
He landed with Mina near the mouth of the Santander River on April 15, 1817, and assisted in seizing Soto la Marina three days later.
When the Mina expedition collapsed, Woll sought other ties to the Mexican War of Independence and cast his lot with Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna.
With the achievement of Mexican independence, Woll remained in the Mexican army, became a naturalized citizen, and married Lucinda Vautrey Griggi.
He became a colonel in 1828 and served as an aide-de-camp to Santa Anna during the capture of Tampico from the Spaniards in 1829.
In 1832 he was promoted to brigadier general and awarded the Cross of Tampico.
He and several other officers were commissioned by Santa Anna to conduct and place in the hands of the central government in Mexico City the flag taken from the Spaniards.
In 1832 Woll supported the pronunciamento against President Anastasio Bustamante that brought Gen. M. Gómez Pedraza to the presidency.
From Guadalajara Woll led a small, well-organized force that defeated Lt. Col. Joaquín Solórzano at Taxinastla; he entered Colima on November 15 and placed Pedraza adherents in office, then moved to Morelos.
In 1835 Woll served as quartermaster general during Santa Anna's campaign that put down the Federalist uprising led by the pure-blooded Indian Juan Álvarez in the south and by Francisco García Zacatecas.
In 1836 Woll was quartermaster general of Santa Anna's army in the invasion of Texas.
On March 8 he reached San Antonio de Béxar and reported to Gen. Vicente Filisola, second in command of the Mexican forces.
After the battle of the Alamo, Woll accompanied Gen. Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma, who had orders to march with 725 men through Gonzales to San Felipe de Austin and thence to Harrisburg and Anahuac.
The force included three infantry battalions, two six-pounder cannons, and forty dragoons.
Ramírez y Sesma confronted Gen. Sam Houston and a Texan army on the opposite bank of the Colorado River at Beeson's Ferry, near the site of present-day Columbus, and began crossing.
Houston retreated.
On April 5, when Santa Anna reached Atascosito Pass on the Colorado, Woll assigned a battalion to construct rafts to ferry across the remainder of the army, which was arriving under Filisola.
Santa Anna then proceeded with a division to San Felipe-and defeat at the battle of San Jacinto.
On April 26 Woll became Filisola's chief of staff.
Informed of Santa Anna's surrender, Filisola dispatched Woll to the Texan camp as an emissary under the pretext of learning the terms of the armistice, but actually to gain information on the strength, armament, and resources of the enemy.
On April 30 Woll rode in under a truce flag and was detained.
Gen. Thomas J. Rusk, commanding the Texan army, transferred Woll to Velasco, where he was given safe conduct to Goliad and released.
Woll joined the retreating Mexican army on June 12.
In 1842 Woll claimed that during the Texas campaign he had persuaded Santa Anna to cancel his order to shoot James W. Fannin and his men, but the order could not be recalled in time.
After the Texas Revolution, Woll played an inconspicuous role in Mexican affairs.
During the brief "Pastry War" with France in 1838–39, he resigned his commission to avoid fighting against his countrymen, but the Mexican government rejected his request and placed him on inactive duty.
When the French troops withdrew, Woll joined Santa Anna and the Centralists in their struggle with the Federalists.
Late in November 1840 he went to New Orleans and negotiated for military supplies and other items, some of which may have been involved in a smuggling operation conducted by his wife at Saltillo.
In December Woll was assigned to service on the northern frontier.
In early June 1842, Woll was appointed second in command to Isidro Reyes in the Army of the North and made head of the Department of Coahuila.
During the summer he received orders to invade Texas (see MEXICAN INVASIONS OF 1842).
Woll was to capture San Antonio, then reconnoiter the Guadalupe River down to Gonzales-all within one month.
He had crossed the Rio Grande at Presidio with his Second Division by August 30 and, following a new route, entered San Antonio on September 11.
He was repulsed by Texan troops in the battle of Salado Creek on the eighteenth, evacuated San Antonio two days later, and returned to Coahuila.
The Mexican government hailed Woll's Texas campaign as a success, promoted him to major general, and awarded him its Cross of Honor.
In February 1843 Woll became commander of the Army of the North.
He served until the northern army, on December 6, 1844, joined a revolt led by José Joaquín Herrera and Gen. Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga against Santa Anna.
Woll was arrested and imprisoned, but freed under a general amnesty decree of May 24, 1845.
Earlier, while commanding on the frontier, he had served with a government commission to arrange an armistice between Mexico and Texas.
James W. Robinson, a Texan prisoner at Perote Prison, had offered proposals to settle the differences between the two countries, and Santa Anna allowed Robinson to return to Texas and present his case.
Houston declared a truce on June 15, 1843.
The commissioners of both governments signed an armistice on February 15, 1844, at Salinas, on the Rio Grande.
However, the Mexican government quickly recalled its commissioners upon learning that the Texans were negotiating in Washington for annexation to the United States and that the Texas commissioners had no authority to discuss a permanent peace.
On June 19, Woll, on instructions from Mexico City, sent Houston a formal declaration of war, and hostilities resumed.
During the United States invasion of Mexico in 1846, Woll served in the Mexican army until Santa Anna's defeat in 1847, then sailed for Europe.
In 1852 he landed in Havana, Cuba, and joined Santa Anna on his return to Mexico.
On April 20, 1853, at Santa Anna's installation as president, he appointed Woll governor and commandant general of Tamaulipas.
When revolutionary disturbances flared, his authority was extended over Nuevo León and Coahuila.
Santa Anna declared himself a dictator on December 16, 1853, but his support faded and he fled Mexico.
Woll also left.
About three and a half years later, Woll reappeared in Mexico as an adherent of President Miguel Miramón, whose Centralist regime had been attacked by Benito Juárez and the Constitutionalists.
On March 22, 1859, Woll landed at Mocambo with several prominent reactionists (Díaz de la Vega, Victor Blanco, and two sons of Santa Anna), reported to Miramón at Veragra, and was given an army command.
During the ensuing Guerra de la Reforma, he defeated Gen. S. Degollado, a liberal leader, on August 30 near León and occupied Zacatecas in November.
In May 1860 he successfully defended Guadalajara.
The Miramón government collapsed on December 24, and Juárez became the Mexican president.
Woll again returned to France.
In 1862, when Napoleon III declared war on Juárez, Woll accompanied the French troops sent to Mexico and was named commandant general of the state of Vera Cruz.
In March 1863 he met with A. Superviele, a Confederate agent, who urged the French government to seize Matamoros.
Woll also served on the Junta Superior de Gobierno, a group of thirty-five formed by the French.
The group chose three Mexican citizens to act as a temporary executive and selected 215 citizens to serve as an Asamblea de Notables.
Appointed on June 29, 1863, the Asamblea met jointly with the Junta Superior and formed a monarchy.
The executive committee, called the
Regencia del Imperio Mexicano, sent Woll and eleven others as a deputation to offer the Mexican imperial crown to Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria.
Maximilian accepted the crown on April 10, 1864.
He asked Woll to draft a plan for organizing the armed forces needed in Mexico.
Woll was designated the adjutant general of the occupation forces when Maximilian landed in Mexico on May 28.
He also was named chief aide-de-camp and promoted to commander of the French order of knighthood, the Legion of Honor.
When Maximilian became displeased with Marshal François Achille Bazaine and demanded his recall, he dispatched Woll in the fall of 1865 to explain matters to Napoleon.
Woll learned that Napoleon planned to withdraw the French troops from Mexico beginning in January 1866, and he never returned to Mexico.
The French soldier of fortune died at Montauban, just north of Toulouse in southern France, in February 1875.
BATTLE OF SALADO CREEK.
Following Brig. Gen. Rafael Vásquez's raid on San Antonio in March 1842, Texan volunteers gathered in that city to launch a retaliatory raid into Mexico.
The release and repatriation of the Texan Santa Fe expedition prisoners, however, was considered a gesture of peace and good will from the Mexican government, causing President Sam Houston to withdraw his sanction from the planned incursion.
The diplomats' visions of peace, however, were shattered within a month when the Mexican army struck again, carrying off a larger scale version of the Vásquez raid.
That fall Brig. Gen. Adrián Woll, a French soldier of fortune serving in the Mexican army, crossed the Rio Grande with 1,000 regular infantry, 500 irregular cavalry, and two pieces of artillery and, on September 11 entered San Antonio.
In response, approximately 200 volunteers from Gonzales, Seguin, and other lower Colorado River settlements marched under Capt. Mathew Caldwell to the east bank of Salado Creek, seven miles from San Antonio.
There they united with Capt. John C. Hays's fourteen man ranger company that had been driven from the city with Woll's approach.
Caldwell, wishing to precipitate a fight but not strong enough to attack the Mexicans in San Antonio, dispatched Hays's men into the town at sunrise on September 18 to draw out the enemy.
If Woll could be lured into the open prairie, Caldwell reasoned, the Texans, although outnumbered, expected to give a good account of themselves from their fine defensive position in the bed of Salado Creek.
Only thirty-eight horses in the Texan camp were fit for duty, thus only thirty-eight men could go into Bexar as decoys.
Hays, accompanied by Henry E. Mc
Culloch, William A. A. "Bigfoot" Wallace, Robert A. Gillespie, and thirty-four other Texans, arrived a mile from the city between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, dismounted, and prepared an ambush.
Hays and Mc
Culloch then remounted and, taking six men with them, boldly ventured to within half a mile of the Alamo, taunting the Mexican cavalry to come out and fight.
Hays had hoped to be pursued by about forty or fifty Mexicans.
Instead, 400 to 500 cavalrymen chased them toward the Salado.
Woll had just completed preparations to move against Caldwell, and when Hays and Mc
Culloch made their appearance, Woll's whole force of cavalry was already in the saddle, ready to give chase.
Woll said he "would go in person and drive the Texian wolves from the bushes."
He accordingly rode out with nearly his whole force, including a large number of the Mexican residents of Bexar, to attack Caldwell's position.
As Hays, Mc
Culloch, and their half dozen companions approached the Texans hiding in ambush, Hays ordered them to mount and fall back.
The rangers fell back briskly across the mesquite-covered prairie toward Caldwell's position, where their comrades were camped among the cottonwoods, cedars, and live oaks of the creek bottom.
For the first four miles the Texans, with the advantage of a lead of one half a mile, kept out of reach of the Mexican cavalry without much difficulty.
Too soon, however the fresh horses captured by Woll on the eleventh began to gain on the somewhat jaded mounts of the rangers.
As the Mexicans gained ground, the Texans threw off blankets, hats, and raincoats in an attempt to lighten their horses' loads.
McCulloch, commanding the rear guard of ten picked men, pressed close upon the heels of the foremost rangers.
"The race," wrote Reverend Z. N. Morrell, "was an earnest one."
The Mexicans made a desperate effort to cut off Hays by passing his right flank.
McCulloch kept between him and the Mexicans, sending couriers every half mile or so urging Hays to put for the timber, and finally, when the timber was reached, Mc
Culloch had only one man with him, Creed Taylor.
These two had been targets for the Mexicans for the last half mile at a range of 150 to 200 yards.
From 100 to 200 shots were fired at them on the run, but not a ball struck man or horse.
The men in camp had slaughtered a beef that morning and were engaged in cooking and eating when Hays's men dashed in, closely pursued by Mexican cavalry.
The Texans' ruse, however, had its desired effect.
The battle was joined on terrain favorable to the Texans.
Every man was soon at his post and ready for action.
"The enemy crossed the Salado above us," wrote Miles S. Bennet, and took a position several hundred yards to the east.
At about 10:00 A.M. Woll's entire command, estimated to be 1,500 men, formed and maintained continuous fire, recalled N. B. Burkett, but "on account of the distance we did not pay a great deal of attention to them."
Caldwell sent out a typically confident call for help.
"The enemy are around me on every side, but I fear them not," he wrote to the men of the nearby settlements.
Vowing to hold his position until reinforced, "Old Paint" invited the Texans to join in the sport.
"It is the most favorable opportunity I have seen," he assured his neighbors.
"I can whip them on any ground, without help, but cannot take prisoners.
Why don't you come?
Hurra for Texas."
Throughout the day Caldwell's men continued to circle their positions making themselves conspicuous so that their fighting force might appear to be greater in number to the enemy.
After a day of desultory skirmishing and artillery and small arms fire, the Mexican right and left wings attacked, leaving a clear field of fire open through their center "to play with their cannon."
"We whipped them in about fifteen minutes," wrote Burkett, "shooting some of them down within twenty steps of our lines."
Among the slain was Vicente Córdova, leader of the abortive rebellion of 1838.
After this, according to Thomas Jefferson Green, Woll "used every persuasion to make his men charge the Texians, but to no purpose.
The Texian rifle, when directed by steady nerves . . . was awfully destructive."
As the night came on and the firing ceased, Woll retired from the field.
In the day's fighting, the Mexicans reportedly lost sixty men killed and many more wounded, while only one Texan was killed and nine to twelve were wounded.
Most of the Texas volunteers were eager to counterattack and free the prisoners held within Woll's lines.
While Texan arms were enjoying success on the Salado, a tragedy was transpiring not far away.
In response to Woll's invasion, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson had raised a fifty-three man company and marched down from La Grange.
Nearing Caldwell's embattled line on the eighteenth, it was intercepted by a column of several hundred irregular Mexican cavalry supported by a battery of two field pieces.
After a spirited but futile resistance that saw half of the command cut down by artillery fire, Dawson's men began to surrender.
Once the Texans were disarmed, however, the Mexicans again fired upon them.
Two escaped and fifteen were marched away to Perote Prison in Mexico.
Of these men, only nine would survive to return to Texas (see DAWSON MASSACRE).
Unfortunately for the Texan cause, a hard rain fell all of the next day, and consequently no advance was made.
About midnight several of the Texans entered the Mexicans' camp "to engage in a little `sport'" and found that Woll had stolen "a trick from George Washington's book by burning his camp fires" and had evacuated the city under cover of darkness.
On learning that the Mexicans had begun their retreat, the Texans followed, but were halted for the night by the muddy crossing of the Medina River below San Antonio.
No further contact was made with the retreating Mexicans until Woll was overtaken at the crossing of the Hondo River by Hays's company, riding half a mile in advance of Caldwell's main army.
Pressing rapidly forward about 3:00 P.M., the rangers came up with Woll's rear guard strongly positioned and supported by a battery commanding the road from the north.
With no knowledge of the artillery's presence, Hays charged the Mexican rear guard, driving it back upon Woll's main force and overrunning the guns before the enemy had fired half a dozen rounds.
The boldness of the charge took the Mexican army by surprise, no doubt saving Hays's command many casualties.
Hays's horse was shot from under him but only two of his men were wounded.
Woll, discovering that the rangers were supported neither by infantry nor artillery, rallied and recaptured the battery.
Severely outnumbered, the Texans fell back three or four hundred yards into a dry creek bed where Caldwell's main body joined them and began to fortify the position in anticipation of another Mexican attack.
Among the Texan officers, however, a heated difference of opinion arose as to the practicability of successfully attacking the enemy.
The usually aggressive Caldwell held a council of war, and more time was lost in discussing the situation.
McCulloch came to the front and called for volunteers to advance, and Judge John Hemphill urged the importance of an immediate attack.
But, according to John Holland Jenkins, "a lethargy had fallen upon the command that effectually retarded further progress."
As night approached on the 22nd, the Texans stood in their ranks, "suffering for water and tantalized almost to madness by the delay and want of harmony among our leaders."
At three o'clock next morning, Woll hustled his troops across the Hondo and force marched them toward the Rio Grande.
At this point, pursuit by the Texans was abandoned.
The fall of 1842 had been exceptionally rainy, and the rivers between San Antonio and the Rio Grande were experiencing an unwonted flow.
Had the command held together, continued its harassment of the retreating Mexicans, and awaited the arrival of the squads and companies of volunteers already on their way to the army, Bennet believed, Woll's army could have been destroyed before it reached Mexican soil.
As it was, Caldwell's volunteers returned from the Hondo deprived of their showdown fight with Woll's command.
Only a few miles up the road toward San Antonio they met the vanguard of Edward Burleson, arriving with reinforcements.
Green spoke for the army when he observed that "General Burleson may not be considered a tactician in the strict sense of the term, but he never failed to observe one rule in winning battles more important than all the minutiae of the drill: that rule is, to fight."
DAWSON MASSACRE.
After the capture of San Antonio on September 11, 1842, by Brig. Gen. Adrián Woll in the second of the Mexican invasions of 1842, Texan forces gathered on Salado Creek under Col. Mathew Caldwell to repel the raiders.
While Texas arms were succeeding at the battle of Salado Creek on September 18, 1842, a calamity was occurring only a mile and a half away.
In response to Caldwell's call for volunteers, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson had raised a fifty-three-man company, mostly from Fayette County, and marched down from La Grange.
Believing Caldwell's forces to be in grave danger, Dawson's men chose not to wait for Capt. Jesse Billingsley's company, which was following them, but to disregard the threat posed by numerous heavy Mexican cavalry patrols and to fight their way to the Salado.
Near Caldwell's embattled line, between 3 and 4 P.M. on the eighteenth, the company was intercepted by a column of 500 irregular Mexican cavalry commanded by colonels Cayetano Montero, José María Carrasco, and Pedro Rangel and supported by a battery of two field pieces.
According to the accounts of several survivors, the Mexican column was commanded by Juan Nepomuceno Seguín, but they were no doubt in error.
Dawson dismounted his men in a mesquite thicket where Fort Sam Houston now stands and threatened to "shoot the first man who runs."
The Texans were quickly surrounded but repulsed a spirited cavalry charge and inflicted a number of casualties on the enemy.
The Mexicans then fell back out of rifle range and opened fire on the Texans with their artillery.
Billingsley's company, which arrived while the fight was in progress, was too weak to go to Dawson's aid, and Caldwell's men on Salado Creek were heavily engaged throughout the afternoon.
Montero once more ordered his cavalry, then dismounted, to charge.
After a vigorous but futile resistance, the severely wounded Dawson sought to surrender.
The Mexicans continued to fire, however, striking Dawson several more times.
Seeing surrender to be impossible, he gasped out his dying words, "Let victory be purchased with blood."
Alsey S. Miller took up the white mackinaw that Dawson had waved in token of surrender and rode with it toward the Mexican lines, only to be fired upon in his turn.
Miller then galloped through the enemy toward the town of Seguin.
Henry Gonzalvo Woods, after witnessing the death of his father and the mortal wounding of his brother Norman, also escaped.
Some of the Texans continued to resist while others laid down their arms.
Heroic in the fight was Griffin, a slave of Samuel A. Maverick, who, his rifle shattered, fought on with the limb of a mesquite tree until he was killed.
By 5 P.M. the fight was over.
Thirty-six Texans died on the field, fifteen were taken prisoner, and two escaped.
The prisoners were marched away to Perote Prison in Mexico.
Of these men, only nine survived to return to Texas.
Thirty Mexicans were estimated to have been killed and between sixty and seventy wounded.
Two days later the Mexican army retreated toward the Rio Grande, and the Dawson men were buried in shallow graves in the mesquite thicket where they fell.
MEXICAN INVASIONS OF 1842.
Because of Mexico's refusal to recognize the independence of Texas after the Treaties of Velasco, the republic was in constant fear of a Mexican invasion.
The fear assumed reality on January 9, 1842, when Gen. Mariano Arista issued a statement from Monterrey telling the Texans that it was hopeless for them to continue their struggle for independence and promising amnesty and protection to all who remained neutral during his planned invasion.
Early in March, Goliad, Refugio, and Victoria were occupied, and on March 5 the Mexican troops under Rafael Vásquez appeared before San Antonio.
The Texans retreated, leaving the town to the Mexicans, because John C. Hays found it impossible to gather enough men to make a defense immediately.
The militia under Alexander Somervell was called out, however, and gathered at San Antonio on March 15, but the Mexican forces had abandoned the town on March 9.
Edward Burleson, the leader of the volunteers, had no orders to follow the invaders; so the Texan force remained in San Antonio until it was disbanded on April 2.
The most unfortunate result of the raid was the panic that it caused in the western settlements.
On March 10 President Sam Houston declared a national emergency and ordered the archives removed to Houston, but the people of Austin refused to let the records be taken.
When Houston issued a second order on December 10, the struggle known as the Archive War resulted.
Meanwhile Houston had made an appeal to the United States for money and volunteers, and Adjutant General James Davisqv was sent to Corpus Christi to organize volunteers with orders to hold them until the time was opportune for an invasion of Mexico.
On June 7 Davis's forces had a skirmish with Antonio Canales Rosillo, but Canales soon retired to Mexico.
During the session of the Texas Congress that met on June 27, ten million acres of land was appropriated to finance a war of invasion against Mexico, but the bill was vetoed by Houston.
Davis's forces were dismissed, and Texas was left undefended.
On September 11, 1842, Gen. Adrián Woll, with a force of 1,200 Mexicans, captured San Antonio.
By September 17, 200 Texans had gathered on Cibolo Creek above Seguin and marched under Mathew Caldwell to Salado Creek six miles northeast of San Antonio.
On September 18 Caldwell sent Hays and a company of scouts to draw the Mexicans into a fight; the battle of Salado Creek resulted.
While the fight was going on, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson approached from the east with a company of fifty-three men.
These men were attacked a mile and a half from the scene of the battle and killed in what came to be known as the Dawson Massacre.
Woll drew his men back to San Antonio and retreated to Mexico by September 20.
The reinforced Texans pursued him for three days and then returned to San Antonio.
By September 25 a large number of Texans had gathered at San Antonio, and plans were made for a punitive expedition, the Somervell expedition, which evolved into the Mier expedition.
