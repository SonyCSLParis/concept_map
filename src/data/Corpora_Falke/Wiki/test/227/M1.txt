Indepedence!
Road to the Texas Revolution TSHA is proud to announce the launch of a new series of seven eBooksoffering an exclusive look at the Texas Revolution,including the battles and heroes that changed Texas history.
Battle of Gonzales    October 2, 1835
The first shots of the Texas Revolution were fired when fighting broke out at Gonzales between Mexican soldiers and Texas militiamen.
When Domingo de Ugartechea, military commander in Texas, received word that the American colonists of Gonzales refused to surrender a small cannon that had been given to that settlement in 1831 as a defense against the Indians, he dispatched Francisco de CastaÃ±eda and 100 dragoons to retrieve it on September 27.
Though CastaÃ±eda attempted to avoid conflict, on the morning of October 2 his force clashed with local Texian militia led by John Henry Moore in the first battle of the Texas Revolution.
The struggle for the "Come and Take It" cannon was only a brief skirmish that ended with the retreat of CastaÃ±eda and his force, but it also marked a clear break between the American colonists and the Mexican government.
Battle of Goliad    October 10, 1835
The battle of Goliad was the second skirmish of the Texas Revolution.
In the early-morning hours of October 9, 1835, Texian settlers attacked the Mexican Army soldiers garrisoned at Presidio La BahÃ­a, a fort near the Texas settlement of Goliad.
La BahÃ­a lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers at Presidio San Antonio de Bexar and the then-important Texas port of Copano.
Siege of Bexar    October 27 â€“ December 9, 1835
The siege of Bexar (San Antonio) became the first major campaign of the Texas Revolution.
From October until early December 1835 an army of Texian volunteers laid siege to a Mexican army in San Antonio de BÃ©xar.
After a Texas force drove off Mexican troops at Gonzales on October 2, the Texan army grew to 300 men and elected Stephen F. Austin commander to bring unity out of discord.
The Texans advanced on October 12 toward San Antonio, where Gen. MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cos recently had concentrated Mexican forces numbering 650 men.
Cos fortified the town plazas west of the San Antonio River and the Alamo, a former mission east of the stream.
Battle of ConcepciÃ³n    October 28, 1835
The battle of ConcepciÃ³n occurred on October 28, 1835, the opening engagement in the siege of Bexar.
After the skirmish at Gonzales on October 2, the Texas army under Stephen F. Austin grew to 400 men as it advanced on San Antonio.
Gen. MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cos, with a Mexican army that peaked in size at 750 men in late October, fortified the plazas in San Antonio and the Alamo mission across the river.
The battle, which occurred near the site of Mission ConcepciÃ³n, was the first engagement of the siege of Bexar and resulted in Mexican forces withdrawing to defensive positions in Bexar.
Grass Fight    November 26, 1835
The Grass Fight, on November 26, 1835, became the last engagement in the Siege of Bexar before the final Texian assault on the town.
In November Col. Domingo de Ugartechea had left San Antonio with a cavalry escort to guide reinforcements to the garrison commanded by Gen. MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cos.
After the departure of Stephen F. Austin to represent Texas in the United States, the Texian army elected as commander Col. Edward Burleson, who continued to harass Cos while scouting for the return of Ugartechea.
Texian forces intercepted a Mexican cavalry unit west of town which they suspected of carrying the payroll of the army.
When the fighting ceased, the Texians determined it was actually a foraging expedition carrying grass for the livestock.
Battle of LipantitlÃ¡n    November 4, 1835
The battle of LipantitlÃ¡n occurred on November 4, 1835, on the east bank of the Nueces River three miles above San Patricio in San Patricio County, directly across from Fort LipantitlÃ¡n.
A Texian force of around seventy men under Adjutant Ira J. Westover engaged a Mexican force of about ninety men under Capt. NicolÃ¡s RodrÃ­guez.
The Texans scored an important victory.
Battle of the Alamo    February 23 â€“ March 6, 1836
The battle of the Alamo (February 23 â€“ March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution.
Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de BÃ©xar.
Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texiansâ€”both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United Statesâ€”to join the Texian Army.
Battle of San Patricio    February 27, 1836
Gen. JosÃ© de Urrea, through a network of spies, kept track of the Johnson-Grant forces and left Matamoros with about 400 men.
Upon learning that Johnson was camped at San Patricio, he put his men through a forced march during a bitterly cold, wet night and arrived at San Patricio at 3:00 A.M. on February 27.
His first action was to send thirty men under Capt. Rafael Pretala to the ranch where the horses had been taken.
In the attack four men were killed and eight taken prisoner.
In San Patricio Urrea reported sixteen killed and twenty-four taken prisoner.
Johnson and four men quartered with him managed to escape and made their way back to Goliad.
