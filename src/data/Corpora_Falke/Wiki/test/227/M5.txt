Texas RevolutionTEXAS REVOLUTION.
The Texas Revolution began with the Battle of Gonzales in October 1835 and ended with the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836; but there were earlier clashes between official forces and groups of colonists, so that it is impossible to set dogmatic limits in speaking of military episodes alone, to say nothing of the development of social and political differences that were a part of the revolution.The seeds of these differences were planted in the national habits and experiences of Mexican rulers and Anglo-American occupants of Texas.
Misunderstanding was aggravated in the minds of Mexicans by the conviction that the United States government was not above making use of the colonists to cause trouble in the hope of acquiring Texas by purchase or revolution.
Military incidents occurred in 1826, 1832, and 1835 preceding the decisive movement in the fall of 1835.
In 1826, Haden Edwards and Benjamin W. Edwards in East Texas attempted to inaugurate a war for independence (see FREDONIAN REBELLION) but were suppressed by Mexican soldiers supported by militia from Stephen F. Austin's colonies.
A series of attacks in 1832 resulted in the withdrawal of Mexican garrisons from Anahuac, Velasco, Nacogdoches, and TenoxtitlÃ¡n.
In the Anahuac disturbances, the Anglo-American attack was led by John Austin and was precipitated by indiscretions of the commander, John (Juan) Davis Bradburn.
Fighting was determined at Velasco, where Col. Domingo de Ugartechea was attempting to prevent reinforcements and artillery from sailing to Anahuac, and both he and the insurgents suffered severely (see VELASCO, BATTLE OF).
The battle of Nacogdoches resulted in the Mexican garrison's evacuation after only nominal resistance; and Col. JosÃ© Francisco Ruiz, a native of San Antonio, abandoned Fort TenoxtitlÃ¡n without being attacked.
Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna was leading a revolution against President Anastacio Bustamante at the time of these disturbances in Texas, and the colonists who participated in them declared that they were cooperating with him by expelling Bustamante's garrisons from Texas.
Actually, the great mass of the colonists had no quarrel with Mexico or Mexicans and adopted resolutions assuring the authorities of their loyalty-at least, they wanted no war with Mexico.
Tranquillity seemed about restored on this basis when a seriocomic episode occurred at the mouth of the Brazos.
Col. JosÃ© Antonio MexÃ­a sailed in with a regiment of Santanisto soldiers and inquired what was going on.
With him was Stephen F. Austin, who had been in Mexico during the summer, and by Austin's advice it was decided to stand by the declaration of the insurgents for Santa Anna.
After enjoying appropriate hospitalities, MexÃ­a sailed away, but one result of his visit was serious: it had compelled Austin to abandon his policy of aloofness from national party contests.
The summer closed with Santa Anna successful in Mexico and all garrisons expelled from Texas except those at San Antonio and Goliad.
The colonists held the Convention of 1832 and Convention of 1833 and asked for a number of privileges and reforms, of which three were the most important.
(1) In September 1823, Congress had given the colonists certain tariff exemptions for seven years.
This liberal law expired in 1830, and friction over the tariff was an element in the disturbances in 1832.
Both conventions adopted petitions asking for extension of the tariff exemptions.
(2) When the federal system was instituted in 1824, Congress united Coahuila and Texas as a single state, with the somewhat indefinite assurance that the union might be dissolved when Texas was qualified for statehood.
Both conventions declared that Texas was able to maintain a state government and asked for separation.
The Convention of 1833 went so far as to frame a constitution for the approval of Congress (see CONSTITUTION PROPOSED IN 1833).
(3) Apprehension over heavy Anglo-American colonization led Congress to pass the Law of April 6, 1830, forbidding immigrants to settle in territory adjacent to their native country.
Though this law was subsequently interpreted to permit continued settlement in the colonies of Austin and Green De
Witt, it remained a menace to the development of Texas, and the conventions petitioned for its repeal.
Resolutions of the Convention of 1832 were never delivered; but Austin, elected to present the petitions of 1833, arrived in Mexico City in July.
In brief, Congress repealed the immigration restriction of the law of April 6, 1830, held the tariff plea in abeyance, and took no action on the petition for statehood.
On his way home, Austin was arrested at the instigation of Vice President ValentÃ­n GÃ³mez FarÃ­as and held a prisoner in Mexico until July 1835.
Dissatisfaction over continued union with Coahuilawas alleviated by state laws extending local self-government and granting Texas trial by jury and appellate courts.
At the same time, however, Santa Anna's movements toward overthrowing the Constitution of 1824 and establishing virtual dictatorship aroused bitter opposition.
Details of the Santa Anna program included remanning the military posts evacuated in 1832 and reorganizing the state government.
The first contingent of soldiers arrived at Anahuac in January 1835, and some local friction soon developed.
In June a mail courier brought news that federal troops had arrested the governor and that large reinforcements would soon strengthen the standing garrison at San Antonio.
This information led to a march against Anahuac in which the volunteers were commanded by William B. Travis.
Capt. Antonio Tenorio surrendered the post without a contest, and superficially conditions in Texas appeared to return to the status of 1832.
Numerous mass meetings condemned Travis and adopted resolutions declaring loyalty to Mexico.
Reports continued, however, that Santa Anna was bent upon military occupation of Texas, and a group of colonists published a call for election of delegates to a convention, or consultation, in October.
Austin, returned from his long detention in Mexico, gave his approval to the Consultation and was made chairman of a committee of safety and correspondence at San Felipe.
The committee was regarded as a central advisory board to collect and distribute information.
From this time forward, only a spark was necessary to set off an explosion.
At Copano Bay, Gen. MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cos landed at the head of 500 men, formed his troops, and moved on San Antonio.
Austin's committee called for the immediate formation of military units to offer armed resistance.
Cos announced his intention to punish those who led the uprising at Anahuac, and in his proclamation was the hint that he would drive the American settlers out of Texas.
The day after Cos arrived in San Antonio on October 9, Texans seized Goliad, the location of a Mexican constabulary on the road from Copano to San Antonio.
At the Battle of Gonzales, what is regarded as the first shot in the Texas Revolution was fired.
Because of growing unrest, the military commandant of Coahuila and Texas, Col. Domingo de Ugartechea, whose headquarters were also in San Antonio, demanded of the citizens of Gonzales the return of a cannon that had been presented, or at the least lent, to them in 1831 for defence against Indians (see GONZALES "COME AND TAKE IT" CANNON).
Alcalde Andrew Ponton not only refused the demand but also called to other Texans for help.
Annoyed by Ponton's refusal, Ugartechea sent about 100 dragoons under the command of Lt. Francisco CastaÃ±eda to seize the cannon, forcibly if necessary.
Originally, only eighteen men constituted the Gonzales defense, but by October 2 the ranks had increased to about 160 volunteers.
Commanded by John Henry Moore and Joseph W. E. Wallace, the Gonzales Texans stood their ground, and the dragoons returned empty-handed to San Antonio.
Austin, at this time in command of the newly formed Texan "army" (see REVOLUTIONARY ARMY) and in the Gonzales vicinity, realized that Texas had reached the point of no return.
In early October he therefore led his command, all volunteers, toward San Antonio.
Two others shared the command, James Bowie and James W. Fannin, Jr.
On the night of October 27 Bowie, in general command, staked out a solid defensive position on the San Antonio River not far from Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepcÃ­on de AcuÃ±a Mission.
On the following morning in the Battle of ConcepciÃ³n the Texans defeated a combined force of Mexican foot and horse soldiers supported by artillery, with the Mexicans losing sixty men to the Texans' one.
On November 26 the Texans again faced the Mexicans at the Grass Fight.
Once again Bowie was in command, but this time with Edward Burleson, who assumed Austin's command, the latter having been made commissioner to the United States by the provisional government.
The Texans forced the Mexicans to retreat, killing fifty of them in the process, while losing two men with another unaccounted for.
The climax of the siege of Bexar came on December 5, when, learning that Burleson was considering withdrawal to Goliad, Benjamin R. Milam raised the defiant cry, "Who will go to San Antonio with old Ben Milam?"
and he and Frank (Francis W.) Johnson led 300 volunteers into the heart of the city.
After three days of house-to-house fighting, Milam was dead and San Antonio was the prize of the Texans.
Ironically, Cos's final stand was at the Alamo.
Forced to surrender, the Mexican commander was compelled to take his troops beyond the Rio Grande.
Taking advantage of the fact that the Texan army was divided and disintegrating after its victories in 1835, Santa Anna, in his role as generalissimo, crossed the Rio Grande shortly after the new year.
He was on a punitive expedition conducted in much the same way as that against the Zacatecans.
His plan was simple and direct: he would crush insurgency in Texas with the force of a hammer, treating all in arms against his government as mere pirates.
The quelling of piracy, after all, required no mercy.
At the beginning of his campaign, it seemed apparent that he would do just that, for Texan fortunes took a decided turn for the worse in early 1836.
By March 2 the Convention of 1836, meeting at Washington-on-the-Brazos, formally voted for independence, though in view of Santa Anna's powerful force, such action might have been considered premature.
The convention also appointed Sam Houston major general of the Texas army and commander of the forces at Gonzales.
After crossing the Rio Grande with 6,000 troops, Santa Anna's command eventually grew to more than 8,000.
It soon became apparent that his target was San Antonio and the Texans stationed there.
In point of fact, he probably should have avoided that city, for it was not important to his success.
The Texan defense stood on a triangle.
On the west was San Antonio, on the south was San Patricio, and on the northeast was La BahÃ­a (Goliad).
Militarily speaking, Goliad was the prize.
It held approximately 500 insurgents under the command of Fannin, while a divided command under Bowie and William B. Travis at the Alamo comprised only 150 men, to which only some thirty more were soon added.
The door to East Texas, with its heavy American population, Goliad, and Presidio La BahÃ­a was its key.
San Antonio, however, even reinforced, could not offer a real threat to Santa Anna or even to his line of communication.
But military considerations aside, the general was determined to march on San Antonio, in part because of the humiliation visited upon his family through defeat of his son-in-law, Cos.
