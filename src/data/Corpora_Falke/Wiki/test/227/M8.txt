The convention of 1832 and 1833
The Convention of 1832
Texans Settlers followed the news of the Mexican Civil War with great interest, hoping Santa Anna Would Win because the Texan Settlers believed that a new Federalist government would respond to their needs.
On October 1, 1832, a convention was held to discuss their problems.
At any convention, delegates, or people chosen to speak for a group, would discuss issues and decide a course of action.
Meeting at San Felipe de Austin, these delegates chose Stephen F. Austin as their leader.
All these delegates wanted change in Texas
They demanded immigration from the U.S to continue.
They also wanted Texas to be a separate Mexican state because at the time Texas was part of a bigger state called Coahuila y Tejas
Ramon Musquiz, the governor of the Department of Texas, supported these concerns.
According to Mexican Law, The Convention of 1832 was not a legal meeting.
Because the delegates had not met legally, Ramon Musquiz refused to send their requests to the Mexican Government.
So The Convention of 1832 failed...The Convention of 1833
Shortly after The Convention, Santa Anna won the civil war in Mexico and became president.
The Federalists now held power.
News of this victory in Texas called to another convention.
This convention took place on April 1, 1833.
The delegates in this convention were firmer than the first.
This time they chose William H. Wharton as their leader.
The delegates this time asked for better mail service, improved defense against the Native American Raids, the right to use English in business and law, they again demanded an end to the ban against immigration, more money for better schooling, and they urged that Texas should be a separate Mexican State.
Even though William H. Wharton was the leader, Austin still took an active part in this convention.
David G. Burnet wrote about why the settlers wanted statehood.
He noted that Mexico's founders had combined Texas and Coahuila into one state, and that Texas was to become its own state as soon as the population grew big enough.
"Texas suffered as a part of Coahuila y Tejas," said Burnet.
The state government gave few services to the towns of Texas
The last part of The Convention of 1833 was to draft a constitution for Texas.
The special task of drafting a constitution for Texas was rested upon newcomer's Sam Houston's shoulders.
"The Land of Promise" was what Sam Houston called Texas.
The convention's work was soon completed.
The delegates took a strong stand in favor of Texas Statehood.
They hoped Mexico City would welcome their ideas.
All the Convention needed now was a messenger.
Stephen F. Austin set off for Mexico City, hoping to finish the business quickly, but was completely unaware of the trouble awaiting him.
