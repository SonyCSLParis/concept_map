Welcome to our Irish
Hungerstrike.com.
This site is dedicated to the ten brave men who sacrificed their lives in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in Ireland, rather than allow the British government to class them as criminal, and to keeping their memories alive in Ireland and throughout world.
Read on to discover why the Irish Hungerstrikes of 1981 became an epic battle of wills between the Irish Republican prisoners, and the British Government.
The hunger strike of 1981 was one of, if not the most influential periods in the IRA’s long campaign to remove Britain from Irish politics.
It not only thwarted Britain’s plans to criminalise the IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks, but concentrated world wide media attention on the war in Ireland, paving the way for Sinn Fein’s entrance into the political arena and the electoral successes that followed.
Ten men, ten Irish Republican volunteers paid the ultimate sacrifice during those summer months of 1981.
Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond Mc
Creesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe Mc
Donnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Tom Mc
Ilwee and Mickey Devine.
Their names are written on the hearts and minds of every Irish Republican in Ireland and abroad.
