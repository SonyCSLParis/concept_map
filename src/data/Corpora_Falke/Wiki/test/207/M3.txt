Overview1.1 Background Information
The Troubles was a period of ethno-political conflict in Northern Ireland which spilled over at various times into England, the Republic of Ireland, and Continental Europe.
The duration of the Troubles is conventionally dated from the late 1960s and considered by many to have ended with the Belfast Agreement of 1998 (answers.com).
The principal issues at stake in the Troubles were the Constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the relationship between the mainly-Protestant Unionist and mainly-Catholic Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland (answers.com).
The Catholics and Protestants of Ireland had long before this period of trouble been in uttter confrontation with each other.
The Catholics were believed [by the unionists and the British] to be dirty, low class people who came secondary to the Protestants.
In 1969 the Royal Ulster Constabulary attacked a Catholic civil rights protest.
Counter-demonstrations by Protestant loyalists lead to escalating violence (guardian.co.uk).
The violence brought on by the demonstration proved to be a sign for much of the IRA.
"Frustrated by what they saw as the passivity of the IRA's leadership, some members formed a new group, which they call the Provisional IRA" (guardian.co.uk).
Which is now the most well known version/sect of the IRA.
The Hunger Strike of 1981 was one of, if not the most influential periods in the IRA's long campaign to remove Britains' role from irish politics (irishhungerstrike.com).
It was a seminal event in modern Irish history.
It radicalised nationalist politics, and was the midwife to Sinn Féin as a serious political force, which ultimately led to it overtaking the SDLP as the main nationalist party in Northern Ireland (experiencefestival.com).
It not only thwarted Britain's plans to criminalise the IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks (irishhungerstrike.com).
This "criminalisation" policy was objectionable to IRA inmates, who saw themselves as "prisoners of war", not common criminals (news.bbc.co.uk).
But this concentrated world wide media attention on the war in Ireland (irishhungerstrike.com).
This world wide media attention assisted Ireland in getting the help she needed to survive the British.
"Ten men, ten Irish Republican volunteers paid the ultimate sacrifice during those summer months of 1981 to the cause of the Irish finally being able to be truly free: Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond Mc
Creesh, Patsy O'Hara, Joe Mc
Donnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Tom Mc
Elwee, Kieran Doherty and Mickey Devine" (irishhungerstrike.com).
1.2 How did it start ?
The strike started in 1981.
The British Government created the Criminalization policy.
This was the government trying to see the prisoners as criminals and reduce their freedom of being able to associate with the inside comrades (guardian.co.uk).
The Republicans thought that this was the British Government's plan to break the liberation struggle in Ireland and to make the prisoners more as criminals.
The prisoners would be de-politicized and the British Government wouldn't think they were a threat (irishhungerstrike.com)1.3 What were the effects?
There were many effects of the 1980 and and 1981 Hunger Strikes.
A new coined phrase, Criminalisation, was first formed here (irelandsown.net).
This policy meant that from the first of March in 1976, any sentenced [IRA prisoner] would no longer be allowed the usual rights of a [political] prisoner in Ireland (larkscript.com).
The men and women in prison were denied a lot of basic rights.
For example, the prisoners' right not to recreational pursuits, the right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week, and full restoration of remission lost through the protest; were all taken away (larkscript.com).
These were called "The five Demands" (wikipedia.com).
Thankfully, these rights weren't excluded forever and were won back after the hunger strike in Belfast.
1.4 How did it end?
Of coarse the hunger strike did not last forever.
The end of the hunger strike came on October 3, 1981 (The Hunger Strike of 1981).
Many prisoners died throughout the strike, not making it alive to the last few days.
At this point, there were six Republican prisoners still on strike and refusing to eat their food (The Hunger Strike of 1981).
The reason the hunger strike ended was because the prisoners realized that when they would laps into unconsciousness, their families would ask for medical intervention (The Hunger Strike of 1981).
Three days after the hunger strike ended an announcement was made.
On October 6, 1981, James Prior, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, announced a series of measures which met the aspects of the prisoners' five demands (The Hunger Strike of 1981).
The Blanketmen stated this statement at the end of the hunger strike, "We, the protesting republican prisoners in the H-Blocks, being faced with the reality of sustained family intervention, are forced by this circumstance, over which we have little control as the moment, to end the hunger-strike" (End of Hungerstrike Statement).

The people were physically hurt from force feeding.
Gaughan's brother went to visit him in jail.
He described him as being skinny and mellow with a cut throat and loosened teeth.
He lost 76 pounds during this force feeding.
At age 24, he died and the British Government say it was from pneumonia.
They said this was due to the force-feeding tube piercing his lung and food pushed in them.
This was Gaughan's last message to the Republican comrades "I die proudly for my country and in the hope that my death will be sufficient to obtain the demands of my comrades.
Let there be no bitterness on my behalf but a determination to achieve the new Ireland for which I gladly die.
My loyalty and confidence is to the IRA and let those of you who are left carry on the work and finish the fight.''
