Introduction: Everyone Has a Part to Play (pp. 1-8)For a number of years, one of the first republican murals to be encountered on Belfast’s Falls Road was of forty-five-year old ‘political prisoner’ Sevgi Erdogan.
The mural called on viewers to ‘support the Turkish hunger strike’ and reminded them that ‘she was inspired by [Irish hunger striker] Bobby Sands’.
³ Erdogan was a member of Turkey’s Revolutionary People’s Party-Front (DHKP-C); she died in July 2001 after a prolonged hunger strike.
According to a report drafted by the New York-based human rights organization Human Rights Watch: ‘As of October 2001, thirty-three prisoners and eight relatives had died in hunger strikes in...1 Prison Protests and Broad Fronts (1972–1975) (pp. 9-19)On 15 May 1972, five members of the Provisional IRA embarked on a hunger strike for ‘political status’.
The men were led by Billy Mc
Kee, OC of the republican prisoners in Belfast’s Crumlin Road jail.
In a statement of support, their comrades argued: ‘As soldiers they are entitled to be treated as POWs’.
² In turn, the hunger strikers promised victory or death.
One week later, another five IRA men joined the protest.
Years later, Mc
Kee admitted that a hunger strike had already been ‘on the cards’ and that the prison leadership ‘decided to bring it forward … to try and...2 Lean Days and Uphill Battles (1976–1977) (pp. 20-41)With the benefit of hindsight, Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams noted that Britain’s policy of ‘criminalization’ – which is what republicans called it – ‘struck at the heart of the republican struggle, and did so at a time when it was politically weak’.
³ Up to that point, the Movement had made much of the de facto ‘prisoner-of-war’ or ‘political status’ granted to its members.
Now, however, republicans argued that ‘British propaganda … [was] attempt[ing] to establish that the military and political struggle that had been going on … in the [North] had ceased to exist, and that the British were only...3 Steps in the Right Direction (1978–1979) (pp. 42-73)Speaking at a New Year’s Day demonstration organized by the Derry Relatives Action Committee, a relative of a local prisoner claimed that 1978 would be the year for the prisoners.
As the demonstration was drawing to a close, a pledge was circulated and read aloud.
It called on supporters to ‘protect the rights of all Irish Political Prisoners based on the principles of Truth, Justice, Freedom and Charity, and so … resolve to pursue the principles by prayer, protest and publicity’.
³The demonstrators were asked to redouble their efforts that year.
Still, according to the
Derry Journal, only about 400...4 Building the Campaign (1980) (pp. 74-91)As journalist Kevin Kelley noted, ‘[t]he process of building a broad … front, which was begun at Coalisland in early 1978, finally reached fruition late in 1979’.
² While 1980 kicked off with yet another large anti-H-Block march, this time it was under the banner of the newly formed National H-Block Committee.
The march was to go from Belfast to the gates of Long Kesh and was scheduled for New Year’s Day – the same day that John Herman officially assumed command of the RUC.
³ Nevertheless, it did not complete its intended route.
According to the
Belfast Telegraph, the police feared...5 Hunger Strike (October–December 1980) (pp. 92-108)At a press conference held on 13 October 1980, the chairman of the National H-Block Committee ‘said that every effort would be made to make the hunger strike unnecessary’.
² Indeed, until now this had been theraison d’êtreof the Committee.
Still, the group’s press statement admitted that many H-Block activists thought that, ‘sooner or later, the prisoners would be forced to embark on a hunger strike’.
³ The Committee now pledged its unconditional support for the prisoners and used this opportunity to announce details of the various anti-H-Block actions planned for the coming weeks.
While the mainstream media tended to...6 Bobby Sands MP (January–April 1981) (pp. 109-127)Though the hunger strike had ended, there was little change within the prisons.
By the start of the New Year, local H-Block committees were openly expressing their concerns regarding the apparent lack of movement by prison authorities.
The Derry ‘Smash H-Block’ Committee warned of a second hunger strike ‘unless the Government ceases at once in playing toady to the prejudices and bigotry of a few petty-minded bureaucrats at the Northern Ireland Office’.
¹ Fr Denis Faul would go so far as to argue that this lack of movement was a ‘deliberate British policy aimed at a split among the prisoners themselves...7 Ten Men Dead (May–October 1981) (pp. 128-156)Days after Bobby Sands’ electoral victory in Fermanagh/South Tyrone, Margaret Thatcher gave a television interview for Britain’s Independent Television Network (ITN).
When asked about the surprise result, Thatcher acknowledged that it ‘show[ed] just how sharp are the divisions between the two communities in Northern Ireland’.
² ‘Having said that’, added the Prime Minister, ‘I don’t think the result of that election fundamentally changes the situation’.
³By this time, republican prisoners Francis Hughes, Patsy O’Hara and Raymond Mc
Creesh had already joined the hunger strike.
Sands’ health was deteriorating and his comrades had been without food for nearly three weeks or more.
Though...8 A Quiet and Uneventful End (October 1981–October 1982) (pp. 157-173)The men of the H-Blocks formally ended their hunger strike protest on Saturday, 3 October 1981; it had lasted a gruelling 217 days.
According to Richard O’Rawe, the remaining hunger strikers were ordered to end their fasts by the IRA’s Army Council.
The date and time this happened was deliberately chosen ‘because the Sunday papers would have already gone to press and there would be a two-day gap to temper the expected triumphalism of the British gutter press’.
² In a very narrow sense, it appeared as though the prisoners had lost – none of their demands had been met.
Nevertheless,...Conclusion: Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things (pp. 174-191)At its final conference, in October 1982, the National H-Block/Armagh Committee openly acknowledged that it had ‘failed to mount and lead an effective, broad and far-reaching campaign’ on its newfound brief.
³ Financial difficulties limited communication with the various H-Block action groups and no new campaign literature was produced.
By September 1982, the committee’s head office in Dublin’s Mountjoy Square had closed.
After agreeing to conclude their campaign, all that would remain was a small caretaker executive ‘to wind up the affairs of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee’.4 But had the Committee successfully fulfilled its original brief?
What did the anti-criminalization campaign...
