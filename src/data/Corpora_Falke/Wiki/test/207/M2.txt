Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator threatening Hillary Clinton’s bid for the White House, made a direct plea to Margaret Thatcher on behalf of the IRA hunger strikers, the Telegraph can disclose.
Mr Sanders made his plea in July 1981 while serving as Mayor of Burlington, the Vermont town where he forged his political reputation.
It is contained in the voluminous Sanders political archive held by the University of Vermont.
These papers also reveal the strong influence the Irish Republican movement had in the town during the 1980s, a time when the “troubles” were at their height.

The IRA hunger strikes were the culmination of a five-year protest by convicted paramilitary prisoners, which culminated in the death of 10 inmates.
Mr Sanders wrote his letter two months after the death of the best-known of the hunger strikers, Bobby Sands.
“We are deeply disturbed by your government’s unwillingness to stop the abuse, humiliation and degrading treatment of Irish prisoners now on hunger strikes in Northern Ireland,” Mr Sanders wrote in a letter which was co-signed by Terry Bouricius, a Burlington alderman and sent on July 15 1981.
“We ask you to end your intransigent policy towards the prisoners before the reputation of the English people for fair play and simple decency is further damaged in the eyes of the people of Vermont and the United States.”
Britain’s involvement in Northern Ireland was hugely controversial in the United States, where those of Irish descent wielded considerable political influence.
Even though they carried less sway in Vermont than states such as Massachusetts further south, pro-Irish activism remained powerful.

Only two days before the letter was sent, Burlington aldermen were addressed by Fergus O’Hare, a civil rights activist who won a Belfast Council seat at the expense of Gerry Fitt, from the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party.
His address, on the condition of the paramilitary prisoners in H-Block, was deemed to be unofficial because of the opposition of some Burlington aldermen.
A resolution backing the demands of H Block prisoners was not put to the meeting.

Mr Sanders, however, was quoted in the local press, saying: “I am delighted to have a member of the Belfast City Council coming here”.

According to contemporary newspaper reports, another prominent supporter of Mr O’Hare’s right to address Burlington’s aldermen in official session was Jane O’Meara Driscoll – the future Mrs Sanders.
The Vermont files show that Mr Sanders was interested in the heavily criticised “supergrass trials”, which saw a number of paramilitaries convicted on the word of paid informers.
In November 1983, in a letter sent “to whom it may concern”, Mr Sanders urged that the case of another hunger striker, Nicky Kelly, who was convicted of armed robbery in Dublin, be reopened.

Mr Kelly was released the following year and pardoned in 1992, since when he enjoyed a successful political career.
Mr Sanders was on the mailing list of the Vermont Committee for Irish Human Rights, which held a number of events in Burlington.
They included a May 1983 press conference at Burlington City Hall, given by Desmond Wilson, a priest from west Belfast.

According to the publicity accompanying the event, Father Wilson was “emphatic in his belief that the Irish conflict is best understood as one between a local population and an undemocratic foreign power.”
In 1986 Bernadette (Devlin) Mc
Aliskey, who at one point was banned from the US, addressed a meeting at a municipal auditorium in Burlington.
Mr Sanders is not the only American presidential hopeful to have had links with the Irish Republican movement.
Donald Trump attended a Sinn Fein fundraiser in New York in 1995 and was filmed shaking hands with Gerry Adams.
Their meeting took place several months before the Provisional IRA unleashed an attack in London’s docklands killing two people.
