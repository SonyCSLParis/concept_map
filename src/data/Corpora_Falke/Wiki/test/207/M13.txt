Ten Men Dead: The Story of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strikeby David Beresford, Peter Maas (Introduction)In 1981 ten men starved themselves to death inside the walls of Long Kesh prison in Belfast.
While a stunned world watched and distraught family members kept bedside vigils, one "soldier" after another slowly went to his death in an attempt to make Margaret Thatcher's government recognize them as political prisoners rather than common criminals.
Drawing extensively on secre ...morePaperback, 334 pages

This is, without a doubt, one of the most harrowing and detailed accounts of the Irish Hunger Strike of the early 1980's that I have read to date.
Hailing from a land similarly rife with sectarian divisions (South Africa), the author David Beresford, a writer for the Guardian newsletter, succeeds fully in squarely illustrating the complicated temperament of conflict that led ten men to willingly starve themselves to death in a prison protest.
Not once does the discussion lapse into blunt politics ...moreNoahOct 16, 2007

One of the best works of non-fiction I've ever read.
Even though it is from the perspective of the Republican Movement, the author is surprisingly objective.
Although he does note that no one can actually be objective about the Troubles.
PamJan 15, 2014I chose to read this book because during one of my last trips to Gaza, I met one of the men who was supposed to join the 1981 Irish hunger strike.
He didn't, because it was finally called off after 10 men died in their struggle to force the British government to treat them as political prisoners rather than "common" criminals.
Although I found the book tedious to read at times because it was difficult to keep track of all of the players, as well as to figure out some of the code words and Irish ...moreTomJul 25, 2007

This is a journalistic account of the 1981 IRA Hunger Strikes, detailing with a keen eye the struggles of the prisoners and their families, the impact this had on the politics of Northern Ireland, and drawing parallels with earlier Irish struggles.
The book makes great use of the communiques smuggled in and out of the Maze Prison, and catches the dark humour of the men behind the wire - one prisoner who managed to smuggle in a pen, tobacco, a radio and a wad of messages became known as "The Suit ...moreMichaelfortin2013Jun 15, 2013
The Spring and Summer of 1981 had the world riveted as ten Irishmen starved themselves to death rather than wear prison clothing.
Why did they do it?
And how could they endure the agonizing pain as their bodies literally ate themselves.
Beresford writes a poignant piece of journalism relating the story and the human beings involved.
This is an emotional story, one of agony and triumph.
To understand the hunger strikers and their conviction, this is a must read.

An important book in terms of contributing an objective point of view to the literature around the hunger strikes and the wider field of colonisation and resistance in general.
Well-written, gripping but heartbreaking at the same time, it is a book I am sure I will be returning to in the future.

What a sad moving story, that really shows the mentality on both sides, were no side could afford to lose, really lets you see what was going on inside & outside the Maze at that terrible time.

Shelves: current-affairsTen Men Dead offers very good insight into the 1980 Maze Hunger Strike.
While it is a consuming read, it offers a balanced account of not only the hunger strike, but also the political, social and religious climate in Ireland at that time.
The author also does a nice job explaining the context of the strike and prision, which I think dispells many misconceptions surrounding the IRA and its command structure as well as the resulting decisions of the prisoners.
I also appreciated the level of deta ...moreMalaka Mohammed

What makes this book worth reading is its focus on personal stories of the Irish hunger strikers.
You reach to a point where you need to cry of how unbearable their lives used to be. "
Ten Men Dead" also presents the letters of the strikers that managed to send to the outside world.
In a lot of instances, I feel like reading a story of a Palestinian hunger striker and how determined and committed to their rights.
From a more personal perspective, I could link Bobby Sands to Samer Issawi.

Shelves: historical-biographicalThis is such a good and thought-provoking book looking at the Irish troubles from the viewpoint of I.R.A. prisoners and their families.
While not condoning the violence it does at least give you an idea as to the reason for it and as the hunger strikers die one by one it's pretty harrowing stuff and a total condemnation of politicians and their hypocrisy.
I've read it loads of times and still find it moving

Very informative book.
If you are interested in the 1980 Hunger Strikers in Northern Ireland, this is definitely a book for you.
It has actually excerpts from notes smuggled out of prison from the hunger strikers which is really cool for history buffs.
It is a tough read because of the many characters and historical aspects though.
HelenSep 16, 2007
The author was given unheard-of access to the IRA's library of "comms"--notes secretly sent in and out of Britain's most secure prison.
Critics of the hunger strike say that the hunger strikers were forced to do it, but here you can read in their own words why they decided to have a hunger strike and what they went through.

This story will make you cry your eyes out!
a true story of the H block huger strikers that fought for Irish rights in a time where they were viewed as less than human by the British.
Who in this story are the ones who do not deserve to be called human.

This was really my first real step into the story Irish Hunger Strikers (besides basic research), and my recollection is based on my thoughts when I was a lot younger.
However, I remember the extensive research and work involved in Ten Men Dead and was impressed when reading.
It really does provide an incredible insight into the background of the troubles, and indeed to the Hunger Strike.
The only minor criticism is at the outset the narrative tends to take on different courses when approaching ...moreShaun Neil

Read this book a couple of times over a decade ago & want to read it again.
The author gives as much of an unbiased account of Thatchers heinous government, as that of any Republican struggle.
A must for all students of politics.

If he did not hold it down the kidneys would not get flushed out and the poisons would begin to accumulate in his bloodstream, reaching his brain and killing him.
But water had never seemed so revolting; he could smell it in its jug, as well as the ever-present food at the bottom of the bed.
He tried to drink half a pint, then lie down on his bed and concentrate on holding it down.
But it would come.

Shelves: politics, northern-irelandThis is a magnificent book about the Republican hunger strikes of 1981 in Northern Ireland.
It reads pretty much like a novel and gives an in depth journalistic account of the hunger strike, including detailed transcriptions of the communication between the inmates and the outside organisation.
In my view a must read if you’re interested in the conflict in Northern Ireland.

This was not an easy read.
I took my time to let things digest as I went along.
I am left with more questions than answers, such as how did the peace process progress after then end of the hunger strike.
I was recently in Ireland/Northern Ireland, and it seems that the peace process has worked, but I wonder if that's a superficial face put on for the tourists.

There are too many facts and side notes crammed into this book to make it a flowing narrative, but it did remind me what an awful leader Margaret Thatcher was.
