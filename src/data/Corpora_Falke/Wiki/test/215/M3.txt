For Immediate Release
Patriot or Traitor?
At the New Haven Museum
New Haven, CT, March 25, 2013— Benedict Arnold’s name is now synonymous with betrayal.
But before siding with the British during the American Revolution, Arnold lived and worked as a merchant in New Haven and served as a general in the Continental Army.
Delve into Arnold’s life during the next Spring 2013 Heroes & Villains Lecture at the Museum.
On Tuesday, April 9 at 6:30 pm, Stephen Darley will present “Benedict Arnold: Fallen Hero,” tracing Arnold’s life from his early years in Norwich and New Haven, to his victories won during the American Revolution at the cost of financial and personal sacrifices, to his life after joining the British Army.
The New Haven Museum owns a number of Arnold’s objects from his downtown shop and Water Street home.
Learn more about Arnold in Beyond the New Township: Wooster Square, the Museum’s third neighborhood exhibition, opening in May 2013.
Stephen Darley is a graduate of Utah State University and George Washington University.
After serving in the U.S. Army, he worked as an attorney for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency.
His forty-year interest in the history of the American Revolutionary War and in Benedict Arnold has led to a number of articles on Benedict Arnold and the Revolutionary War.
Darley’s publications include
Voices from a Wilderness Expedition; The Journals and Men of Benedict Arnold’s Expedition to Quebec in 1775 and The Battle of Valcour Island: The Participants and Vessels of Benedict Arnold’s 1776 Defense of Lake Champlain, which is the second book of a planned quartet exploring the significant battles fought by Benedict Arnold for the Northern Army in the first two years of the war.
Darley is a member of the North Haven Historical Society and the Connecticut Society of Genealogists.
He currently serves on the North Haven Inlands Wetlands Commission and the Friends of the North Haven Library.
