The Failed Expedition of Benedict Arnold
By Jeannette Holland Austin
During the early part of September of 1775, Colonel Benedict Arnold led a force of 1,100 Continental Army troops from Cambridge, Massachusetts through wilderness country (now Maine).
But his boats going upon the Kennebec River leaked, ruining gunpowder, spoiling food supplies and more than a third of his men turned back before reaching the land between the Kennebec and Chaudiere rivers.
The troops, inexperienced in handling boats in white water, ended up losing supplies and boats.
When Arnold finally reached the French settlements above above the Saint Lawrence River, his force was reduced to 600 starving men who had traveled about 350 miles through a poorly charted wilderness.
Without the assistance of the local French Canadians, his troops would have never crossed the Saint Lawrence river.
By the middle of November they reached Quebec City and attempted to put it under siege.
When this failed, Arnold withdrew to Point-aux-Trembles until Colonel Montgomery, the officer of the other part of the expedition, arrived to lead another unsuccessful attack on the city.
Among the Montgomery troops was Clark Blandford, later resident of Elbert County, Georgia, who was captured and later paroled.
Blandford returned to New Jersey where he entered the Militia serving until end of war, first under Colonel John Nelson, and then under Lieutenant Colonel Scudder.
He helped in the capture of Bennets Island and was in the battles of Short Hills, Trenton, Springfield, Mud Island and Monmouth.
During his term he served as sergeant and sergeant-major and was wounded in acion three times.
