Partly on Arnold’s suggestion, the Continental Congress authorized a two-pronged invasion of the British Province of Quebec in Canada.
Colonel Benedict Arnold led a force of 1,100 Continental Army troops from Cambridge, Massachusetts in September 1775.
The expedition ran into difficulties amid poor weather conditions and by the time Arnold reached Quebec in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men.
Joined by the other expedition led by Richard Montgomery, Arnold led an attack on Quebec City on December 31, 1775.
The combined assault failed disastrously.
Montgomery was killed and Arnold was severely wounded.
He was however rewarded for his effort with a promotion to brigadier general.

In late 1776, the British planned an invasion of New York from Canada.
Arnold correctly predicted that British General Guy Carleton would sail an invading force down Lake Champlain.
He hastily supervised the construction of a flotilla on the lake.
In the ensuing Battle of Valcour Island on October 11, 1776, Arnold inflicted severe losses on a greatly superior enemy fleet.
Although the British won the battle, Arnold’s action delayed Carleton long enough to hamper the British plans.
Despite his heroic efforts, Benedict Arnold was overlooked as Congress promoted 5 junior officers above him.
He resigned and it was only due to George Washington’s personal persuasion that he rejoined the Continental Army.

In 1777, Arnold participated in the defense of New York from an invading British force under General John Burgoyne.
In the battles against Burgoyne, Arnold served under General Horatio Gates.
Gates and Arnold had a hostile relationship.
On October 7, 1777, during the Battles of Saratoga, Benedict Arnold defied Gates’s authority and took command of a group of American soldiers to lead an assault that threw the enemy into disarray and contributed greatly to the American victory.
He was severely injured during the battle.

In October 1780, shortly after his plan to betray the American fort at West Point was revealed, Benedict Arnold’s open letter was published in newspapers.
It was titled To the Inhabitants of America and was first published on October 11 in New York by the Royal Gazette.
In it Arnold gave justifications for his actions.
He wrote that he was troubled by the corruption, lies, and tyranny of the Second Continental Congress and the Patriot leadership.
He also wrote against America’s alliance with the French and depicted Catholic France as “the enemy of the Protestant faith”.
Many newspapers published responses to Arnold’s letter criticizing his actions as treacherous and justifications as lame.
