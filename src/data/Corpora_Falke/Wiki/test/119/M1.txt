South West property
So much to choose from in England's South West
The region of South West England includes the counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.
That means the range of things to see and do there is extensive.
Property types are also diverse.
There are houses, flats, bungalows and cottages to suit all tastes and budgets.
As you would expect, house prices in the South West are usually lower than in the South East and in London and property in the South West to buy and rent is not just limited to domestic customers.
Investors and traders seeking commercial properties can choose from retail units, offices and more.
New home hunters in the region can choose from fabulous two-bedroom top floor apartments in prestigious new developments, beautifully presented three-bedroom waterside properties, spacious semi-detached family homes in quiet locations, Grade II listed former vicarages, and other appealing properties.
Getting there
The South West is not an ideal London commute, but is still easy to access by road, rail, sea and air.
Motorways serving the area include the M4, M5 and M6.
First Great Western operates high-speed services from London Paddington (and other stations) to destinations across the region.
Bristol, Exeter and Newquay Cornwall Airports link the South West to the UK's major cities, and internationally.
Shopping in the South West
Retail therapy can be enjoyed at the numerous shopping centres, shopping villages, arcades, markets and farmer's markets throughout the region, with familiar high street names rubbing shoulders with exclusive boutiques and independent local shops.
Local economy
There was a time when the South West was almost solely reliant upon tin mining as a means to underpin its economy.
Not anymore.
Now information technology (web design, internet marketing and digital services provision) are the driving force behind the region's growing prosperity.
Perhaps the only downside to relocating to the South West is the climate.
Some years the region sees more rain than any other across Britain.
But this is generally in the autumn and winter - and the riot of colour that comes with spring's arrival is simply amazing, as are the balmy summers!
