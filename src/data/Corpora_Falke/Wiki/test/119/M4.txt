Dig to reveal city's medieval eraA formal excavation process is to start at Canon's Marsh on the harbourside in Bristol, to reveal more about life in the city more than 500 years ago.
The four-month archaeological dig will try to piece together the daily activities of monks who lived at the medieval abbey.
The city's Anglican cathedral now stands on the historic site.
A nearby dig four years ago unearthed glassworks and coins from the 17th Century.
Project manager Richard Young said he hoped the dig would discover enough evidence to reveal a detailed picture of monastic life.
