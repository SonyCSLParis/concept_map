Isambard Kingdom Brunel  (1806â€“1859)Civil and Mechanical Engineer
Isambard Kingdom Brunel is celebrated as an engineering genius.
Brunelâ€™s Great Western Railway was designed for speed and efficiency, and his daring schemes and record breaking structures are still a vital part of todayâ€™s railway infrastructure.
He combined considerable ingenuity with immense boldness of vision in his sometimes controversial achievements.
Born on 9 April 1806 in Portsea near Portsmouth, Isambard Kingdom Brunel was the third child of Marc Brunel, a French Ã©migrÃ© engineer and English mother Sophie Kingdom.
After an education in both England and France, Brunel started an apprenticeship with his father on the construction on the Thames Tunnel in London.
He quickly became resident engineer to the project work, and he was able to gain considerable experience of a large scale and innovative construction project as well as working knowledge of brickwork and cements that would stand him in good stead for his future engineering projects.
The Great Western Railway
Brunelâ€™s work for a proposed bridge across the River Avon at Clifton introduced him to the Bristol Railway Committee.
In 1833 they engaged him to survey a railway line between Bristol and London, and he presented his proposals to the Committee after only three months.
It was an ambitious scheme with carefully planned gradients to make the route as level and straight as possible in order to promote high speed travel on the line.
The Great Western Railway Act was approved by Parliament in 1835 and work on the 116 mile line started in 1836.
The line proved considerably more problematic and expensive to construct than Brunel had originally estimated, not least because of the immense work involved in constructing Box Tunnel near Bath.
Shareholders, particularly in Liverpool, were dissatisfied with Brunel and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him from office before the line was completed.
His robust defence of the engineering on the line secured his position, but debate raged about his use of the broad gauge.
Engineering feats
Brunelâ€™s railway from London to Bristol required pioneering civil engineering.
The Wharncliffe Viaduct (1837) was the first major structure to be completed by Brunel, and the first to be completed on the line.
In 1839 he persuaded the GWR to allow wires for the new electric telegraph system to be installed between Paddington and West Drayton, taking them over the viaduct.
This was the first ever installation of a commercial electric telegraph.
Unequalled anywhere in the world, the arches of the Maidenhead Bridge (1838) were at the time the flattest brick arches ever built.
Box Tunnel (1840) was the largest work on the line and at the time of construction was the longest tunnel ever constructed.
Designs for the Windsor Bridge (1849) for the Great Western Railwayâ€™s branch line and the Chepstow Bridge (1852) for the South Wales Railway developed Brunelâ€™s thinking for the much larger â€˜Royal Albert Bridgeâ€™ (1859) for the Cornwall Railway.
Taking the line across the Tamar at Saltash, this bridge used both wrought iron tubular arches and suspension chains to support the rail deck, giving it its unique appearance.
