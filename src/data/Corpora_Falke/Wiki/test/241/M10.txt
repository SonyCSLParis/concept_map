Converting Mongols to Christianity be like (x-post r/Christianity) MyTILAccountFun fact: the Mongols welcomed Christians to build churches in Mongolia (they also welcomed other religions).
The Khans tried for a hundred years to form an alliance with France, so that they both can attack the Muslim states.
The Mongols wanted French subjugation; the French wanted conversion to Christianity from the Mongols.
Neither happened.
They did end up fighting in a few battles together, but no formal alliance.
It all started when Muslims in the Steppes declared Jihad on Genghis.
It also doesn't help that Genghis wife (or daughter in law) was a Persian Christian
CelletempCan't make an alliance.
Different religions means they can't royal marry.

Was it France?
I know very little about the Christian-Mongol alliance but I was always under the impression it was to be with the Crusader States.
France would be very far away to fight Muslims with the Mongols.
Champion-SanThe King's Angelshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Mongol_allianceKingofAlbaAlba Several attempts at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, were made by various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire
Many Western Europeans were known as Franks in that area regardless of whether they were Frankish or from France.
proquo I'm also to understand the Muslims referred to the Crusader States as "the Franks" with no concern for proper names or titles.

The Crusaders returned the favor by called all Muslims "Saracens" regardless of whether they were Arabs, Turks or anything else.
Specialist290 We have attacked the enemy in Al Amarah
Further down the page, it mentions that Louis IX of France himself was in communication with the Ilkhanate Mongols in Persia regarding a proposed joint invasion of the Holy Land.
It fell through, though.
altrsaberAll that shows is that Louis IX would have been apart of the Frankish alliance, but that doesn't mean he would be the only member.
The article also mentions negotiations with the Pope, various Crusader States, the Byzantine emperor, the Armenians, the English, the Hungarians, various Italian republics, etc.
Specialist290 We have attacked the enemy in Al Amarah My only point is that, for all that "Frankish" was often generalized to "European," OP was not incorrect to say that the French themselves were involved.
KingofAlbaAlbaNot technically incorrect, but it's not surprising that the major states in Europe would establish relations with the Mongols.
I wouldn't say that thinking about maybe helping each other is an alliance in the true sense of the word.

From the perspective of realpolitik, is there any actual difference?
[deleted]The Crusader states were overwhelmingly French, though.
And you have to remember that this is long before the concept of the nation-state as we know it existed, and there was a strong connection back to France.
Arguing the semantics of this is really pointless, because it's so nuanced that trying to understand it through modern concepts of statehood and ethnicity isn't going to work.
TessHKMKHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANFrance had no problem fighting Muslims in the Crusades.
proquoBut that would have been very different.
Fighting the Crusades, at least for those that fought them, would have an air of religious duty.
You were supposed to fight them because you were a good Catholic.
Other than that, France wouldn't have been too concerned with the Muslims except for maybe the ones in Iberia.
For the Mongols an alliance with the Crusader States would make more sense than with France.
The Crusaders were right there, much closer than France.
They had a shared enemy in the Muslims.
Think about it in CKII terms: would you ally with a kingdom off at the fringe of the map?
TessHKMKHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANThe crusader states were mainly French...proquoBut they weren't France.
[deleted]I see a lot of argument about this here.
It's really pointless.
If you're trying to frame this all through modern concepts of nationhood you're only going to be wrong.
proquo 1 Punkt vor 12 Monate I'm not at all trying to make this about nationhood.
It's my understanding that the Crusader States had their own royal families, and while they were very related to French houses and spoke French as a language they were not ruled by France or considered to be French vassals.
They were independent enough from the Kingdom of France that a Mongol alliance with France would not have made the Crusader States allies and vice versa.
If I'm incorrect about that go ahead and explain how I am; I admittedly don't know much about the Crusader States but I don't think I'm incorrect in saying that they weren't France.
MushroomMountain123Whatever happened to the Muslims in the Steppes?
In the later game starts a lot of the areas East of Russia are Muslim.
Is that area still Muslim?
Lord_IggyFrisiaThey are still there.
Tatars and Bashkirs often practice Sunni Islam, you can see them fairly easily in a religious map of Russia.
Their religion and culture have been eroded somewhat by centuries of Orthodox dominance, but they are still there.
So are the Buddhist Kalmyks.

Epitath of a Nestorian in Monglia
Chinese Nestorian Steles from Tang Dynasty[deleted]There were plenty of steppe tribes/individuals before and during the Mongol Empire which were Christian, incidentally- mostly Nestorians, as the Church of the East was the only one which would evangelise so far out.
Islamic rulers had no problem with them preaching to non-Muslims, which meant that places like the Steppes were fertile ground for Nestorian conversions.
The Keraits, for example, were (supposedly, if Bar Hebraeus is to be believed) Christian from the 11th century, at least among their ruling clans- as well as various important Mongol nobles and wives such as Kitbuqa, Sorghaghtani Beki and Doquz Khatun.
Brrieck What am I going to do with all these dead incest babies?
My first old gods to finish game was as the Zoroastrian Empire.
I prepared for a century to get ready against the Mongols as I had only barely defeated the Seljuks.
The first battle my Shahanshah died, then his son was the one who lost the empire, and his son was the count of some insignificant castle in the Ilkhanate.
The Mongols converted Nestorian, and that made them even more vicious.
It was concerning at first, especially when the grand coalition of independent Persian Zoroastrians rose up, only the get massacred.
I had spent time usurping the title of my own duke, then getting an alliance of the last Zoroastrian Satraps, who were getting forcibly removed as the Mongols had essentially converted half the Empire and started taking out the Byzantines who had grown into the holy land since I only cared about keeping my own borders along with a couple of independent kingdoms in Turkestan and Arabia.
Eventually I lost, and the Mongols cut off my head.
