Christian - Mongol "Crusader Alliance" ??
First, the Mongols attacked Russia:Quote:1237-40 - Mongols invade Russia, destroying all of its main cities except Novgorod and Pskov; Tatars establish the empire of the Golden Horde in southern Russia.
(BBC)Then, Christians attacked Russia, a couple of years later:Quote:The Battle of the Ice...was a battle between the Republic of Novgorod and the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights (whose army consisted mostly of Estonians) on April 5, 1242, at Lake Peipus...The battle was a significant defeat sustained by Roman Catholic crusaders during the Northern Crusades, which were directed against pagans and Eastern Orthodox Christians rather than Muslims in the Holy Land.
The crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Russian territories for the next century.
(wikipedia)And then, Mongols attacked Iraq, with Christian assistance (cp.
Khan Hulagu's wife was Christian), some years thereafter:Quote:The Siege of Baghdad, which occurred in 1258, was an invasion, siege and sacking of the city of Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate at the time, and the modern-day capital of Iraq, by the Ilkhanate Mongol forces along with other allied troops under Hulagu Khan...The invasion left Baghdad in a state of total destruction... Baghdad remained depopulated and in ruins for several centuries, and the event is widely regarded as the end of the Islamic Golden Age...[The Mongol army] contained a large contingent of various units from Christian vassals, chief among them apparently the Georgians, who were eager to avenge the sacking of their capital, Tiflis, decades earlier by Jalal al-Din Khwarazmshah.
Other participating Christian forces were the Armenian army, led by their king, and some Frankish troops from the Principality of Antioch (wikipedia)Note that "the Ilkhanate initially embraced many religions, but was particularly sympathetic to Buddhism and Christianity" (wikipedia).
QUESTION -- does the above suggest any kind of (loose) coordination-of-action, between Christians, and their Mongol allies, in the mid-13th century AD ?
Sure, there was some sort of Christian-Mongol "alliance" at the time.

Christians & Mongols vs. Russia, again & again ?
A century later,Quote:The Battle of Kulikovo ... was a battle between Tatar Mamai, and Muscovy Dmitriy, and portrayed by Russian historiography as a stand-off between Russians and the Golden Horde... The battle took place on September 8, 1380...Tatar Mamai [reflected] economic and political interests from outside, particularly Western Europe, which in the battle were represented by numerous Genoese mercenaries (wikipedia)Another centuries later still, Mongols & Christian Crusaders attacked Russia again:Quote:The Great Standoff on the Ugra river ... was a standoff between the forces of Akhmat, Khan of the Great Horde, and the Grand Prince Ivan III of Russia, in 1480...In early 1480, the Teutonic Order of Livonia subjected the western borders of Russia to multiple attacks... In January 1480, Ivan's brothers Boris Volotsky and Andrey Bolshoy...turned against him.
Akhmat Khan decided to take advantage of the political discontent, and in June 1480 sent a reconnaissance unit to investigate the right bank of the Oka river.
In autumn his army started to advance towards Moscow, he passed through the Lithuanian territories of his ally king Casimir and stood on the Lithuanian-Muscovite border on the river Ugra (wikipedia)And then a group of Mongols (who had become Muslims by this point), formed an alliance with the Christian Poles and Lithuanians against the Teutonic Knights.
The Teutonic Knights eventually suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Grumwald in 1410.

Thanks for the link !
Interesting letter from queen Russudan of Georgia to the pope.
We were preparing for Crusade when Jebe and Subutai invaded.
Raided Georgia, killed king Georgi IV LASHA and then went north.
They were carrying nine tailed yak banners and we thought they were Christians.
(+we knew they invaded Khwarezmid Empire)It worked the other way around as well, I seem to remember the Crusaders allowing a lorge Muslim army from Egypt pass unmolested through their territory to defeat the Mongols in Iraq.
It was a little earlier than that, 1260 to be exact.
The Mulmaks seeked permision to pass unmolested through the Crusader Kingdoms, even stopping to resupply outside of Acre.
They were able to meet the Mongols in battle and effect the first milatry defeat on them at Battle_of_Ain_Jalut Battle_of_Ain_Jalut I don't think they were allies.
The crusaders and the Mongols simultaneously and independently waged wars against Arabs on the Middle East and Russians on Eastern Europe, which is the corollary from the Mongol expansion in Asia and the European medieval circumstances.
Please elaborate on this if you know more (dates and which crusade was taking place at the time + combatants) I have been told that if the Crusaders had jioned forces with the Mongols and attacked the Muslim army then there was a good chance that the entire Islamic faith would crumble.
