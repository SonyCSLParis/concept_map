Why didn't the Franco-Mongol alliance formalize in the 13th century?
After reading a little about Rabban Bar Sauma, a Christian who made a pilgrimage from China to Jerusalum and later became the Mongolian ambassador to Europe, my question is why didn't the alliance form?
They seemed to have similar goals - taking out the Mamluks/Muslims.
