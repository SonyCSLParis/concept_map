Belton House, Lincolnshire
During medieval times the manor of Belton was owned by St Mary's Abbey at York but, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the land reverted back to the Crown.
No architectural evidence has been found of the original manor house, if indeed there was one, but the surviving gate piers of a post-Dissolution residence can still be seen in the north wall by the Orangery.
In the late 17th century, having inherited most of his great-uncle's wealth as well as his estate at Belton, Sir John Brownlow decided to build a new country house for his family.
Several architects have been associated with Belton House, including Sir Christopher Wren, but it is more feasible that William Winde and William Stanton were largely responsible for the design and construction of the property, possibly seeking advice from Roger Pratt.
After a slow start, Belton House took less than four years to complete, Sir John and Lady Brownlow moving in during November 1688.
Initially, the d√©cor and furnishings were recorded as being quite modest, but it seems a more luxurious finish was created during the 1690s.
The epitome of Brownlow's success is perhaps reflected in the fact that he entertained King William III on one occasion, for which he was duly honoured.
Two years later he had taken his own life, but the reason is still a mystery.
Although several rooms underwent a number of functional changes throughout the 300 years it belonged to the Brownlow family, Belton House today represents a perfect example of a neo-Caroline English country house.
This vast H-shaped residence was given a major refurbishment at the hands of Sir Jeffrey Wyatville in the early 19th century, but the 3rd Earl was responsible for the remodelling programme later that century that restored much of the original Caroline splendour to Belton House.
During the 1960s an extensive restoration of the property was carried out to prevent further deterioration of the fabric.
There are over 200 pictures on public display, a large proportion of them being late 17th century portraits, a sizeable collection of porcelain and silver, and an impressive array of Regency furniture throughout the many rooms of Belton House.
The Marble Hall gives the visitor a first impression of the elegance they are about to witness, and a hint of the various periods now beautifully brought together under one roof.
In the east wing of Belton House, the Chapel, Drawing Room and Gallery retain their 17th century interiors almost intact, and the Chapel itself contains a stunning reredos of the same period.
This carved, wooden masterpiece resembles a Grinling Gibbons altar decoration to be found at Trinity College (Oxford), and was painted to give a marble-like appearance at the end of the 19th century.
Of particular interest is the rare example of a painted floor in the Tyrconnel Room, the actual date of which is unknown but believed to be early 19th century.
Upstairs, two of the bedrooms show very distinct styles.
The Yellow Bedroom survives as one of the James Wyatt interiors, dating from the 1770s, and the Queens Bedroom has been restored to its original appearance of 1841 when Queen Adelaide stayed at Belton House.
No country house worthy of note is complete without a setting of formal gardens, sculptured parkland, water features and parterres.
Little has survived of the spectacular baroque garden created for Sir John Brownlow but Wyatville's classical plans have left Belton House with a magnificent Italian Garden, fountain and Orangery.
The grounds alone require a few hours to fully appreciate their beauty and expanse, but to take in a tour of Belton House as well a whole day should be allowed.
On the other hand, this is an ideal place to re-visit at different times of the year and monitor the ever-changing vistas.
Belton House remained in the Brownlow family until 1984, when it was given to the National Trust.
