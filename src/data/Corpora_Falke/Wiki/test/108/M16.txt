Belton House, located near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England ,was built between 1685 and 1688 for "Young" Sir John Brownlow.
Brownlow was the eldest surviving son of Sir Richard Brownlow and Elizabeth Freke.
In 1679, he inherited the Belton estates from his great-uncle Sir John Brownlow, 1st Baronet of Belton.
The Brownlow family started to acquire land in the Grantham area in 1598 but did not acquired the Belton Manor House until 1619.
When Sir John inherited the property from his great-uncle, he decided to build a new country house on the property.
The architect believed to be responsible for the initial design of the house was William Winde.
The house has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren while some believe it was designed by Roger Pratt.
Though, there is the most evidence linking the design to Winde, it is not one hundred percent clear that he designed the house.

Belton House is an example of the Carolean style, which is also known as the Restoration style.
The style was popular in England following the restoration of the English monarchy and during the reign of Charles II.
The style has many similarities to Palladio's designs.
Belton House features a "double pile" plan with a saloon at the center of the house.
It also followed the older style of having the reception rooms and bedrooms spread throughout the house's main floors.
The floor plan followed Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be separated.

The land was laid out with avenues and a large lake was dug.
He also had numerous ash trees, oak trees and fruit trees planted throughout the property.
Closer to the house, there were formal gardens that featured symmetrical walks and canal ponds.
These features of the gardens were removed by the end of the 18th century.

Belton House was in the Brownlow family for over 300 years.
Alternations were made to the house and up until the 20th century, the family were able to keep the house in good repair.
Like many members of the aristocracy, the Brownlows had financial problems following World War I.
It became increasing hard for the family to maintain the house and property.
They attempted to open the house to the public in order to keep the house in the family but that attempt failed.
In 1984, the 7th Baron of Belton transferred ownership to the National Trust, which continues to operate the house as a historic site.
Since becoming a National Trust site, Belton House has been used as a film location in several mini-series.
It is probably best known as being the location for Rosings Park in the 1995 adaption of Pride and Prejudice.
It has also been seen in Bleak House (1985 & 2005), Jane Eyre (2006), and The Buccaneers (1995).
