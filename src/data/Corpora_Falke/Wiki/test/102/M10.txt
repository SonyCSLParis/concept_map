[12]Model of JerusalemA scale model of Jerusalem giving a vivid view of the city as it existed before it was destroyed by Romans in 70 AD, was prepared by the archaeologists associated with the study of the city's ancient culture.
The project was sponsored in 1964 by the Holy Land Hotel of Jerusalem.
It was made between 1964-74 by Michael Avi-Yonah and was refined and elaborated by Tsafrir.
The model was made with authentic material such as stone and marble[dubious – discuss] from Jerusalem itself, embellished with colorful small ceramic tiles and goldleaf fixed to the temple and palaces.
The model was built to a scale of 1:50 provided with illustrations and explanatory pamphlets by Tsafrir.
