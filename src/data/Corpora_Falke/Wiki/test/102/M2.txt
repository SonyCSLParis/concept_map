A fascinating, recent discovery appears to have solved one of Jerusalemâ€™s biggest historical mysteries: the location of the Acra, the fortified compound in Jerusalem built by Antiochus Epiphanes, ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, following his sack of the city in 168 BCE.
The renowned fortress was used to control the Jewish city and to monitor the activities in the temple.
The Akra was eventually conquered by the Hasmoneans.
