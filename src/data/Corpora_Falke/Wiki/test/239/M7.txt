Far Eastern Party - Background
The Australasian Antarctic Expedition, commanded by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914.
The expedition's main base was established in January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, AdÃ©lie Land.
This was much farther west than originally intended; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit.
Only after the Auroraâ€”heading westâ€”had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.
Battling katabatic winds that swept down from the Antarctic Plateau, the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer's sledging expeditions.
The men readied clothing, sledges, tents and rations, conducted limited survey parties, and deployed several caches of supplies.
The most notable of these depots was Aladdin's Cave, excavated from the ice on the slope 5.5 miles (8.9 km) to the south of the main hut.
On 27 October 1912 Mawson outlined the summer sledging program.
Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east.
The Eastern Coastal Party, led by the geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.
The final party, led by Mawson, would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards Victoria Land, an area he had explored during Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition in 1908â€“09.
He hoped to travel about 500 miles (800 km) east, collecting geological data and specimens, mapping the coast, and claiming territory for the crown.
Assisting him on this Far Eastern Party would be Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz.
They were in charge of the expedition's sledge dogsâ€”Greenland Huskiesâ€”who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended.
Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges.
Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.
