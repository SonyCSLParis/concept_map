John W. Bricker, in full John William Bricker (born Sept. 6, 1893, Madison county, Ohio, U.S.—died March 22, 1986, Columbus, Ohio), conservative Republican politician who held state and national public offices for many years; he was the unsuccessful candidate for vice president of the United States in 1944.
After graduation from Ohio State University in 1916 and admission to the Ohio bar in 1917, Bricker served as a World War I army officer before entering Ohio politics.
His terms as assistant attorney general (1923–27) and attorney general (1933–37) were followed by election to the governorship in 1938.
Reelected twice, he became the first Republican to serve three consecutive terms.
When New York’s Governor Thomas E. Dewey was nominated for president in 1944, Bricker was chosen to run for vice president.
He represented the views of big business in domestic affairs and provincialism in international matters.
The Republicans were defeated at the polls that fall.
In 1946 Bricker was elected to the U.S. Senate, serving from 1947 to 1959.
In Congress he led his colleagues in efforts to curb the power of the president in foreign affairs.
In 1953 he sponsored a constitutional amendment that came to be known as the Bricker Amendment.
In its original form this proposal would have eliminated much of the automatic incorporation of conventional international law into the national law of the United States, leaving it to the political discretion of Congress or the state legislatures to decide upon the internal enforceability of the international obligations of the United States.
Such a change would make it likely that the United States would often fail to observe its obligations under international law, thus restoring the critical situation that existed in this regard under the Articles of Confederation of the 18th century.
Ultimately defeated, the Bricker Amendment was greatly attenuated during the debate by elimination of the restriction upon the enforcement of formal treaties.
The George Resolution, finally voted on, provided that treaties and other international agreements must not conflict with the Constitution, that votes on treaty ratification in the Senate must be determined by yeas and nays, and that “executive agreements” shall not become effective as internal law except by act of Congress.
This proposal failed by only one vote to receive the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate.
In 1959 Bricker returned to Columbus, Ohio, to resume the practice of law.
