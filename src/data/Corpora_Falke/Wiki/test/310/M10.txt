310............................129                                PREFACE                    By Senator Jesse Helms, Chairman                                  and         Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Ranking Minority Member                     Committee on Foreign Relations    From the beginning of the Republic, the process of foreign policy formulation in the United States has been unique.
For most nations, the role of the legislative branch in foreign policy is limited to providing a rubber-stamp on the policies of the executive.
The United States is different.
The United States Constitution requires the President to seek the Senate's ``advice and consent'' in the ratification of treaties and the approval of ambassadorial nominees.
It is an arrangement that gives the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Relations in particular, an essential role in the formulation of foreign policy.
Since its founding on December 10, 1816, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has been at the center of foreign policy in America.
Six Presidents of the United States have served on the Committee: Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, Warren Harding and John F. Kennedy.
The Committee has also produced 19 Secretaries of State and the names of many of its Chairmen--Arthur Vandenberg, Henry Cabot Lodge, William Fulbright--are embossed in the great foreign policy debates of this Nation.
While nearly 200 years have passed since its founding, many of the debates within the Committee on Foreign Relations, surprisingly, remain the same.
In responding to international opportunities and challenges, the Committee must deliberate between conflict or diplomacy, engagement or isolationism, assistance or sanctions, and weigh every option in between.
The Committee also considers treaties, the authorization of appropriations for international affairs, and nominations.
In the latter half of the twentieth century, new issues vie for the Committee's attention.
The proliferation of deadly weapons and technology, peacekeeping in regional and ethnic conflicts, the appropriate role of multilateral institutions, international terrorism, trafficking of illegal drugs, and the balance between international trade and U.S. moral and national security interests are critical issues in today's world.
In an effort to make available to the public this discussion of foreign affairs by Members of the Senate, the Committee continues to publish transcripts of hearings held on these and other topics, and has produced a historical series based on heretofore classified sessions since 1947.
These documents highlight the contribution of Congress to American foreign policy.
A background document on the Committee was first published in 1966 in conjunction with the Committee's 150th anniversary.
This document, now in its seventh edition, serves as a source of information on the Committee's procedures, membership, jurisdiction and other matters.
It is our hope that this revised edition will serve as a useful introduction to the work of the Committee.
The Committee on Foreign Relations                      of the United States Senate    The Constitution of the United States divides responsibility for the conduct of American foreign policy between the President and Congress, and assigns to the Senate specific approval over treaties and nominations.
The powers of Congress concerning foreign relations are derived from the following articles:      The Constitution of the United States of America (Excerpts)                               Article I          Section 1.
All legislative Powers herein granted         shall be vested in a Congress of the United States         which shall consist of a Senate and House of         Representatives.
* * *          Section 8.
The Congress shall have Power * * * To         regulate Commerce with foreign Nations * * * To define         and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high         Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations; To         declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and         make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.
* * *         To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper         for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and         all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the         Government of the United States, or in any Department         or Officer thereof.

* * * No Money shall be drawn from the         Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by         Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the         Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be         published from time to time.
No Title of Nobility shall         be granted by the United States: And no Person holding         any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,         without the Consent of Congress, accept any present,         Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from         any King, Prince, or foreign State.
Section 10.
No State shall enter into any Treaty,         Alliance, or Confederation; * * *                               Article II          Section 1.
The executive Power shall be vested in a         President of the United States of America.
* * *          Section 2.
* * * He shall have Power, by and with the         Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties,         provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; and         he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and         Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other         public Ministers and Consuls, * * *.
Origins of the Committee    During its early years the Senate was a small body that met often as a committee of the whole.
It lacked standing committees, except for three which handled routine housekeeping duties.
When specific issues arose, the Senate appointed ad hoc committees to examine them.
One source estimates that there were ``over 200 separate committees dealing with foreign affairs between 1789 and 1816.''
\1\ The titles of these ad hoc committees varied, and not until 1812 did the term ``foreign relations'' appear in the legislative journals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \1\ James W. Gould, ``The Origins of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,'' Western Political Quarterly, XII (September, 1959).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    In the first session of the First Congress, President George Washington appeared in person before the Senate to seek its advice and consent on the terms of a treaty being negotiated with the Southern Indians.
Unwilling to debate the issue or cast a vote in the presence of the President, Senator Robert Morris of Pennsylvania moved that the question be referred to an ad hoc committee.
According to Senator William Maclay, after he had seconded the motion, ``the President of the United States started up with a violent fret.
`This defeats every purpose of my coming here' were the first words that he said.''
Consideration was postponed for two days when the Senate resumed discussion and voted on the questions at hand, again with Washington present.
This was the President's last attempt to participate in Senate deliberations, and thereafter presidential communications were generally delivered by written message.
Although the Senate continued to name numerous committees each session, certain Senators gained reputations in particular fields and were repeatedly named to committees dealing with their areas of interest.
From 1789 to 1797, nineteen committees with a total of sixty-eight members dealt with treaties.
Yet only twenty-four senators filled those sixty-eight positions.
Members of the majority Federalist party predominated in the early committees dealing with foreign relations.
By 1816, the increased business of the Senate, especially in the handling of nominations, and the pressing needs of national defense that had arisen during the War of 1812, moved the Senate toward creation of standing committees.
On December 10, 1816, the Senate adopted a resolution introduced by Senator James Barbour of Virginia, establishing eleven standing committees:          Resolved, That it shall be one of the rules of the         Senate that the following standing committees shall be         appointed at each session: a Committee on Foreign         Relations, a Committee on Finance, a Committee on         Commerce and Manufacturers, a Committee on Military         Affairs, a Committee on Militia, a Committee on Naval         Affairs, a Committee on Public Lands, a Committee on         Claims, a Committee on the Judiciary, a Committee on         the Post Office and Post Roads, a Committee on         Pensions.
Three days later, Senator Barbour became the first chairman of the new five-member standing Committee on Foreign Relations.
Since the Foreign Relations Committee was named first in the resolution, it has sometimes been referred to as the ``ranking'' Senate Committee.
However, the Senate does not rank committees.
The only reflection of the relative importance attached by the Senate in the recent past to its various committees was contained in a Standing Rule of the Senate from 1969 to the present, that ``no Senator may serve at any time on more than one of the following committees: Appropriations, Armed Services, Finance, or Foreign Relations.''
Historical Overview    From its beginning, the Foreign Relations Committee attracted prominent leaders of the Senate and the nation.
Six Presidents of the United States have served on the committee: Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, Warren Harding and John Kennedy.
So too have nineteen Secretaries of State, from Henry Clay to Edmund Muskie.
Although representing a separate branch of the government, the Committee has worked closely with the Department of State.
During its early years, these relations were enhanced by the many Senators who served as Secretary of State.
From 1816 to 1877, all but two of the eighteen Secretaries of State had previously served in the Senate and nine had been members of the Foreign Relations Committee.
But that close relationship has not prevented conflict between the Executive Branch and the Committee.
Early on, the Committee's chairmen established that it would not be a rubber stamp for administration policies, and often said ``no'' to Presidential initiatives.
Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina, who served as chairman from 1825 to 1829, was a fierce opponent of any and all measures to expand the power of the new federal government.
Indeed, it was said that during his entire tenure in Congress, Macon cast more ``no'' votes than did any ten other members combined.
Another influential chairman of that era was Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, who served as chairman from 1861 to 1871.
With administration attention focused on issues of civil war and reconstruction, Sumner exerted considerable influence over the nation's foreign affairs.
During the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, Sumner led the opposition which blocked Grant's efforts to annex Santo Domingo.
As a result of his break with the administration, the Republican Caucus voted to remove Sumner as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, only the second time in the Senate's history when a committee chairman was removed against his will.
\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \2\ In 1858 the Democratic Caucus had removed Senator Stephen A. Douglas as chairman of the Committee on Territories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    In the late nineteenth century the Senate repeatedly demonstrated its authority over foreign policy through its ratification power.
Between 1860 and 1897, the Senate rejected ten treaties, four of them with Great Britain.
As Secretary of State John Hay observed, ``a treaty entering the Senate is like a bull going into the arena; no man can say just how or when the final blow will fall, but one thing is certain it will never leave the arena alive.''
Despite its reputation as a ``graveyard of treaties,'' however, the Senate ratified the overwhelming number of treaties it received.
\3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \3\ George H. Haynes, The Senate of the United States: Its History and Practice (Boston, 1938), 11:570.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Many a president has learned the difficult lesson that the Executive Branch rarely succeeds when it refuses to compromise with the Foreign Relations Committee.
By far the most monumental struggle between the Committee and the presidency occurred when Woodrow Wilson submitted the Treaty of Versailles for ratification in 1919.
Under the chairmanship of Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the Foreign Relations Committee agreed to report the treaty, but with fourteen reservations drafted by Lodge to protect American sovereignty.
These included language to ensure that the United States remain the judge of its own internal affairs; that the United States retain the right to withdraw from the League; that the League not restrict any individual rights of U.S. citizens; that the United States assume no obligation to go to war or deploy military forces through the League without consent of Congress; that Congress approve all U.S. officials appointed to the League; and that Congress control all appropriations of U.S. funds for the League.
But President Wilson refused any compromise with Lodge, declaring: ``Never, never!
I'll never consent to adopt any policy with which that impossible man is so prominently identified.''
\4\ Wilson then took his case directly to the people in a national speaking tour, during which he suffered a stroke.
His efforts failed to sway the Senate, which in both 1919 and 1920 rejected the treaty, and with it its provision for American participation in the League of Nations.
Wilson could have easily won the Senate's consent to join the League if he had agreed to compromise with the Committee and accept Lodge's reservations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------    During the two decades following World War I, the Foreign Relations Committee often reflected national sentiments for isolationism.
In the 1920's its chairman, William B. Borah of Idaho, led the fight against United States membership in the World Court and other internationalist ventures.
In the 1930's, chairman Key Pittman of Nevada sponsored neutrality legislation designed to keep the United States out of European conflicts.
By 1940, however, such internationalists on the Committee as Walter George of Georgia and Tom Connally of Texas were successful in efforts to repeal neutrality legislation and to enact Lend-Lease and other measures designed to help in the struggle against the Axis powers.
America's entry into World War II, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, converted the Committee's leading isolationists to internationalism.
On January 10, 1945, Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, a leader of Senate isolationists, delivered a ``speech heard round the world,'' in which he declared: ``I do not believe that any nation hereafter can immunize itself by its own executive action.''
In 1947, Senator Vandenberg became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a leading exponent of a bipartisan foreign policy.
During the 80th Congress, with Republican majorities in the Senate and House and a Democratic President in the White House, the Senate approved the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, and other major cornerstones of America's postwar foreign policy.
Coincident with Senator Vandenberg's chairmanship, the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provided for the first professional committee staffs.
The Foreign Relations Committee selected as its first chief of staff, Dr. Francis O. Wilcox, foreign policy specialist for the Legislative Reference Service.
Prior to appointment of a professional staff, the Committee had relied heavily upon the Department of State.
As Dr. Wilcox observed: ``Speeches had to be written there, committee reports to the Senate were prepared by the executive branch; there was no mechanism really by which the Senate could act independently, or could bring to bear the kind of helpful advice and counsel that a professional staff could bring.''
The bipartisan approach to foreign policy had assumed strong presidential leadership in foreign affairs.
But events during the 1960's, most significantly the growing disillusionment over the Vietnam War, led members of the Committee to call for increased Senate involvement in the making of foreign policy.
In June 1969 the Senate adopted a ``national commitments'' resolution proposed by committee chairman J. William Fulbright of Arkansas.
This resolution defined American national commitments as resulting ``only from affirmative action taken by the executive and legislative branches of the United States Government by means of a treaty, statute, or concurrent resolution of both Houses of Congress, specifically providing for such commitment.''
In 1970 Congress repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which Presidents had used as a justification for military intervention in Vietnam.
And in 1973, over a presidential veto, Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution, requiring the President to terminate any troop commitment within sixty days unless Congress approved its continuation.
These actions were designed to restore the shared responsibility between the legislative and executive branches which the Constitution provides for the conduct of American foreign relations.
In 1986, the Committee took a direct role in U.S. diplomacy when Chairman Richard Lugar of Indiana and Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada helped negotiate the departure of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, following the ``People Power'' Revolution.
And in the late 1980's and early 1990's, Chairman Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island forged a bipartisan coalition to enact some of the nation's most important and effective non-proliferation laws, which to this day form the cornerstone of U.S. nonproliferation policy.
In the late 1990's, Chairman Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and the Committee's Ranking Member, Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of Delaware, together secured enactment of landmark legislation to fundamentally reform the U.S. foreign policy institutions for the post-Cold War world--shutting down two obsolete federal agencies (United States Information Agency (USIA) and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency ACDA)) and merging their functions into the Department of State and bringing a third (United States Agency for International Development (USAID)) under the direct control of the Secretary of State.
Chairman Helms, a long-time critic of the United Nations, also collaborated with Senator Biden on legislation to pay the United States arrears to the United Nations in exchange for the U.N.'s agreement to implementation of a series of reform benchmarks.
On January 21, 2000, Chairman Helms and Senator Biden led the Foreign Relations Committee to New York for a field hearing on U.N. reform--the first time the Committee had ever ventured as a group to visit an international institution.
The previous day, Chairman Helms became the first sitting legislator to make a scheduled address before the United Nations Security Council, delivering an address on the United States' sovereign prerogatives and the American people's expectations for the United Nations reform.
Accepting an invitation issued by Chairman Helms in that address, on March 30, 2000, the entire U.N. Security Council came to Capitol Hill for a day of meetings hosted by the Foreign Relations Committee.
The Ambassadors of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, Netherlands, Tunisia, and Ukraine assembled in the Old Senate Chamber for a lecture from the Senate Historian on the Senate's unique role in U.S. foreign policymaking, and participated in a roundtable discussion of U.N. reform and peacekeeping with Committee members in the Committee's hearing room.
In 1998, the Committee also took up one of the most important foreign policy matters to come before the Senate since the end of the Cold War--the expansion of NATO to include three new members from the former Warsaw Pact: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
In stark contrast to President Wilson's clash with the Committee over the Treaty of Versailles, the approval of NATO expansion was a textbook example of bi-partisan cooperation between a Democratic Administration and a Republican Senate.
Unlike Wilson, who refused to accept any of the Committee's reservations to the Versailles Treaty, the Clinton Administration agreed to a series of conditions drafted by Senators Helms and Biden addressing a number of Senate concerns about the administration's approach to NATO expansion, including language requiring that ``the core purpose of NATO must continue to be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO members'' (rather than peacekeeping and other ``nonmilitary'' goals); that a ``fire wall'' be built in the NATO-Russia relationship to ensure that Russia be given neither a voice nor a veto in NATO decisionmaking; and affirming that NATO does not require the consent of the United Nations, or any other international organization, to take action to defend its members' security.
These conditions, negotiated following a series of eight committee hearings, ensured that by the time the expansion protocols reached the full Senate, all the major issues of contention had been resolved and the Senate overwhelmingly approved NATO expansion.
However, the Senate said ``no'' to a number of Clinton Administration initiatives.
Most notably in the 106th Congress, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty--making it the first arms control treaty ever to be voted down in the U.S. Senate.
The lesson is this: Presidents rarely win when they refuse to work with the Foreign Relations Committee, expecting it to rubber-stamp their initiatives.
By contrast, when they have dealt with the Committee in partnership, rather than confrontation, they have seen many successes.
As Senator Helms put it: ``The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has always been a source of frustration for utopian idealists in a rush to remake the world.
And this, I believe is exactly what our Founding Fathers intended.
The Senate is slow to action by design, a brake on impulsive instincts.
And the Foreign Relations Committee was, I believe, intended to be the Senate's brake on foreign policy.''
MembershipSize    The size of the Committee has varied considerably over the years.
From five members in 1816 it grew, with occasional cutbacks, to 23 in 1946 when the Legislative Reorganization Act set it at 13.
Since then it has been raised to 15 in 1953, to 17 in 1959, to 19 in 1965, and to 20 in 1987.
These increases, which were made in most other major standing committees at the same time, reflect partly the growing workload of the Committee and partly readjustments to the political complexion of the Senate--that is to say the numerical ratio of members of the majority party to those of the minority.
Anticipating the eventual enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 which established the size of the Committee at 15 members, the Committee was reduced to that number on January 14, 1969.
Committee size and ratios are worked out by the party leaders with approval by the Senate.
Beginning with 1971 the membership was as follows:            16 (92nd Congress, January 28, 1971)            17 (93rd Congress, January 4, 1973)            17 (94th Congress, January 19, 1975)            16 (94th Congress, September 19, 1975)            15 (96th Congress, January 23, 1979)            17 (97th Congress, January 5, 1981)            17 (98th Congress, January 3, 1983)            18 (98th Congress, February 9, 1984)            17 (99th Congress, February 21, 1985)            20 (100th Congress, January 6, 1987)            19 (100th Congress, March 6, 1987) \5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \5\ A Senator was not appointed to fill the vacancy created by the death of Senator Zorinsky.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------            19 (101st Congress, January 3, 1989)            19 (102nd Congress, January 3, 1991)            20 (103rd Congress, January 5, 1993)            18 (104th Congress, January 4, 1995)            18 (105th Congress, January 7, 1997)            18 (106th Congress, January 6, 1999)Election    The Senate rules provide that the membership on the 16 standing committees shall be appointed, unless otherwise ordered, by ballot at the commencement of each Congress.
The exact rule follows:                               Rule XXIV                       appointment of committees          1.
In the appointment of the standing committees, or         to fill vacancies thereon, the Senate, unless otherwise         ordered, shall by resolution appoint the chairman of         each such committee and the other members thereof.
On         demand of any Senator, a separate vote shall be had on         the appointment of the chairman of any such committee         and on the appointment of the other members thereof.
Each such resolution shall be subject to amendment and         to division of the question.
[Rule XXIV of the Standing         Rules of the Senate.]
However, by unanimous consent the usual practice has been for the two major parties to submit slates of committee assignments for their party members in the form of Senate resolutions.
The two party slates are normally submitted and voted on at the same time.
Assignment to committees must take into account Rule XXV.4 of the Standing Rules of the Senate concerning service on committees.
The ratio of majority to minority members of committees is arrived at prior to the submission of slates by agreement between the leaders of the two parties and generally reflects the political complexion of the Senate.
For example, during the 80th Congress the Senate was composed of 51 Republicans and 45 Democrats and the composition of the committee was set at seven to six.
Following the election in 1980, the Republicans became the majority party in the Senate for the first time since 1954 (53 Republicans, 46 Democrats and one Independent).
Therefore, the breakdown of the Committee became nine Republicans and eight Democrats.
At the beginning of 1985, the Senate composition was 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, leaving the membership of the Committee unchanged.
During the 105th Congress, the Senate had 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats and the Committee alignment of 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats reflected this composition.
The parties have differing procedures for arriving at their slates of nominees for committee membership.
On the Republican side, the chairman of the Republican Conference appoints a committee on committees which in turn recommends assignments based on members' preferences and seniority.
The Democratic caucus, composed of all Senate Democrats, appoints a steering committee, on the recommendation of the Democratic leader, which decides on the Democratic slate, taking into account the preferences of the members, seniority, and the custom of assigning two major committee seats to each Democratic Senator.
Moreover, beginning with the 95th Congress, the Democratic caucus had agreed to choose chairmen of the standing committees by secret ballot unless waived.
Although committees are appointed anew each Congress, it is traditional that Senators are reappointed to the committee to which they were assigned the previous Congress unless they specifically desire otherwise, or they have vacated their Senate seat, or party ratio changes enough to bump junior members.
For example, in the 90th Congress, in order to reflect the change in the Senate ratio, a Democratic seat occupied by Senator Gale W. Mc
Gee was reassigned to the Republicans and filled by Senator John Sherman Cooper, and in September 1975 Senator Baker lost his seat on the Committee as a result of a Democratic victory in the New Hampshire election.
Following the death of a Democratic Senator in late 1983 and the election of a Republican to succeed him, the Senate ratio changed and the size of the Committee was increased by one Republican in early 1984.
Finally, after the Republicans obtained a majority following the 1994 elections, seats on the Committee were reapportioned in accordance with the new ratio allowing Republicans to increase their number to ten.
Democrats, on the other hand, were forced to give up three seats leaving them with eight of the Committee's eighteen slots.
Chairman    The chairman of the Committee is elected on the same slate as the Committee members of the majority party and is generally the most senior member in terms of Committee service of that party's committee slate.
Inasmuch as Senate traditions prior to 1970 prohibited a Senator from occupying more than one chairmanship, there have been instances where a lower ranking majority member (in terms of committee service) has been chairman such as 1941-46, when Senator Connally was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee while two of his seniors on the Committee, Senator Walter F. George and Senator Robert F. Wagner, presided over the Finance and the Banking and Currency Committees, respectively; in 1947-48 when the senior Republican member, Senator Capper, was chairman of the Agriculture Committee and Senator Vandenberg presided over the Foreign Relations Committee; and again in 1985 when Senator Helms, the senior Republican, remained as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and Senator Lugar assumed the chairmanship of Foreign Relations.
As a result of the 1986 elections, the Senate leadership changed.
At that time, Senator Helms exercised his right to the Ranking Minority Member position.
This tradition was enacted into law by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, subject to a ``grandfather'' clause.
Standing committees, such as the Committee on Foreign Relations, continue and have the power to act until their successors are appointed.
For instance, although committees were not appointed by the Senate in the 88th Congress until February 25, 1963, the Foreign Relations Committee began meeting and transacting business on January 9, 1963, when Congress convened.
This also occurred at the beginning of the 99th Congress, when the Committee held hearings on American Foreign Policy, as well as a business meeting, before the vote on February 21, 1985 by the Senate to appoint committees.
In 1977 the new Members of the Senate were assigned to committees on a temporary basis.
Therefore, Senators Zorinsky, Matsunaga and Danforth served on Foreign Relations from January 10 until February 11, 1977 when permanent Members were appointed.
A complete listing of Committee members, composition, and chairmen is contained in Appendices I, II, and III.
The list shows interesting party identifications as well, such as Anti-Democrat, Jeffersonian Democrat, Native American, Oldline Whig, Union Republican, Farm-Labor, and Progressive.
There are also six Presidents, ranging from Andrew Jackson to John F. Kennedy, and nine Vice Presidents from John C. Calhoun to Hubert H. Humphrey, who have served on the committee.
From its membership also came 19 Secretaries of State, beginning with Henry Clay and the most recent being Edmund S. Muskie.
In addition, a great many ambassadorships and positions in international organizations have been filled by former members of the Committee.
It should also be pointed out that on April 24, 1970, Senator J.W. Fulbright exceeded the length of service of Senator Shelby Cullom, who served from December 18, 1901 to March 4, 1913--the previous record for a Foreign Relations Committee chairman.
Jurisdiction    The Constitutional provisions already cited form the basis for the Committee's jurisdiction.
They are further elaborated in Rule XXV.1(j)(1) of the Standing Rules of the Senate as follows:    (j)(1) Committee on Foreign Relations, to which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects;          1.
Acquisition of land and buildings for embassies         and legations in foreign countries.

19.
World Bank group, the regional development banks,         and other international organizations established         primarily for development assistance purposes.
(2) Such committee shall also study and review, on a comprehensive basis, matters relating to the national security policy, foreign policy, and international economic policy as it relates to foreign policy of the United States, and matters relating to food, hunger, and nutrition in foreign countries, and report thereon from time to time.
Every bill, resolution, executive communication, nomination, or report falling within these jurisdictional limits is referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
So are treaties, ipso facto, regardless of subject matter.
In cases of conflicting or overlapping jurisdiction, Rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, provides that--          * * * in any case in which a controversy arises as to         the jurisdiction of any committee with respect to any         proposed legislation, the question of jurisdiction         shall be decided by the Presiding Officer, without         debate, in favor of the committee which has         jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates         in such proposed legislation; but such decision shall         be subject to an appeal.
As a matter of fact, however, frequently these jurisdictional questions have been resolved, under unanimous-consent agreements, by joint or sequential or simultaneous referrals.
In other instances more informal methods have been used.
With the exception of the Appropriations Committee, there is no standing committee with which the Foreign Relations Committee has not shared jurisdiction at one time or another.
Sequential Referrals    A frequently used procedure is an agreement for the sequential referral of bills falling within several jurisdictions.
Generally speaking, jurisdiction over fisheries and maritime issues is shared with the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; national security matters with the Armed Services Committee; certain legal matters with the Judiciary Committee; foreign agricultural policy with the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; and volunteer service programs with the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
Examples of such sequential referrals during the 96th Congress were: a bill to establish an Institute for Technology and Cooperation (which was referred to Governmental Affairs after being reported by Foreign Relations); and a bill increasing the U.S. quota in the IMF (which was ordered referred to Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs after being reported by Foreign Relations).
In the 98th Congress sequential referrals included a crime control bill and one concerning terrorist acts (both with the Judiciary Committee).
Sequential referrals are often coupled with a limitation on the time during which the secondary committee(s) must act or request the Senate for an extension of time.
Joint Referrals    The most frequent joint referrals in the past had been with the Armed Services Committee and included the early military assistance acts, the 1951 Far Eastern investigation prompted by the dismissal of General Mac
Arthur, the so-called ``area'' resolutions (Formosa, 1955; Middle East, 1957; Cuba, 1962; and Tonkin Gulf, 1964 which, to varying degrees, declared the vital interests of the United States in the particular area and authorized the President to take any steps deemed necessary to maintain peace there), and resolutions relating to troop deployments in Europe.
Joint referrals involving other committees dealt with the following subjects: defining the act of state doctrine (Judiciary); implementing legislation for the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (Commerce); add-on retirement benefits (Post Office and Civil Service and Armed Services); an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act concerning trade with North Vietnam (Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs); establishing an Office of Foreign Policy and National Security Analysis (Armed Services); pertaining to nuclear proliferation (Joint Committee on Atomic Energy).
In the 96th Congress, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act and the Public Service Act concerning international cooperation in health was jointly referred to Labor and Human Resources, Governmental Affairs and Foreign Relations; legislation to terminate the Interim Convention of North Pacific Fur Seals went jointly to Commerce, Science and Transportation and Foreign Relations; and a bill to establish an observer program on all fishing vessels was referred jointly to Commerce, Science and Transportation, Environment and Energy, and Foreign Relations.
A new peak in joint referrals was reached in 1976 when S. 3637, the proposed ``National Materials Policy, Research, and Organization Act,'' was jointly referred to 11 standing committees, including Foreign Relations.
One example of legislation referred jointly was S. 1627, which dealt with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Introduced in 1993, this particular bill was referred to the committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, on Foreign Relations, on Governmental Affairs, and on the Judiciary.
On occasion both sequential and joint referrals have been used for the same measure, such as the bill for combating international terrorism, which, after being reported from the Governmental Affairs Committee, was referred jointly to Foreign Relations, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Intelligence and Judiciary Committees; and the Deep Sea Bed Hard Mineral Resources Act, reported from Energy and Natural Resources, Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Foreign Relations, and then jointly referred to Finance, and Environment and Public Works Committees, subject to a time limitation.
In 1984, authorizing legislation for the intelligence community was jointly referred to Foreign Relations and Armed Services for a period of 30 days, after it had been reported by the Intelligence Committee.
In the case of joint referrals, committees need not necessarily meet together during hearings and markup sessions but they must file a joint report setting forth their recommendations.
Simultaneous Referrals    During the 94th Congress for the first time bills were referred simultaneously to Foreign Relations and other committees, establishing yet another method of dealing with jurisdictional problems in the Senate.
One bill (S. 3151) would establish a program for gathering and analyzing information with respect to multinational enterprises and would require publication of such material on a regular basis.
The unanimous consent agreement by which this bill was referred ``simultaneously'' to the Foreign Relations and Commerce committees also specified that ``should either committee report the bill, the remaining committee will have 45 calendar days within which to file its report.''
With respect to another item, S. Res.
434, the ``Treaty Powers Resolution,'' an order to refer it jointly to the committees on Foreign Relations, Rules and Administration, Appropriations, Judiciary and Budget was subsequently rescinded and the measure was then simultaneously referred to the same committees with the exception of Rules and Administration.
The following colloquy in the Senate of May 6, 1976, clarifies that latter order:          Mr. Griffin.
What is the effect of this request?
The Presiding Officer.
The effect will be that each         committee to which the bill is referred would be         entitled to file a separate report without regard to         any other committee or without requiring a joint report         of the several committees.
Mr. Griffin.
Whereas under the agreement previously,         the several committees had to file a joint report; as I         understood it.
The Presiding Officer.
The Senator is correct.
Mr. Griffin.
If one of the named committees, under         the request now pending were to report the resolution,         would it then go on the calendar, or would it still be         pending in the other committee?
The Presiding Officer.
Under the practices of the         Senate, that report would be held in abeyance until the         other committee report and it would not go on the         calendar.
Mr. Griffin.
It would not go on the calendar.
The Presiding Officer.
The Senator is correct.
Mr. Griffin.
I wish to be certain of that because, if         it does go on the calendar, this arrangement would, in         effect, set up a kind of race among the committees to         anyone reporting it.
It would then go on the calendar         and the referral to the other committee would be         academic.
The Presiding Officer.
That has been the practice of         the Senate in the past.
Mr. Griffin.
So it would not go on the calendar until         the other committees also reported?
The Presiding Officer.
The Senator is correct.
Informal Methods    Informal methods include invitations to interested Senators (Senators not on the Committee who, by virtue of legislative or personal interest, have attended hearings on specific topics) to participate in the Committee's hearings and ask questions without, however, the right to vote in the Committee; correspondence with interested committees seeking their views on provisions falling within their expertise, as for instance with the Joint Committee on Taxation on double taxation conventions; or establishment of joint subcommittees as was done in 1974 by the Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees to study wiretapping issues arising out of the confirmation hearings with Secretary Kissinger.
In 1980 two Senators from the Foreign Relations Committee were appointed to serve as members of the Special Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee to Investigate Activities of Individuals Representing the Interests of Foreign Governments, which was created to investigate charges involving President Carter's brother.
Intelligence Activities    Until the creation in 1976 of a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, oversight of intelligence operations was a divided responsibility, exercised principally by a joint subcommittee of the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees.
For a time in the late 1960's, members of the Foreign Relations Committee were invited to participate in such oversight meetings.
In 1974, through an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act commonly known as the Hughes-Ryan amendment, the Committee was given joint jurisdiction with several other committees over certain activities of the Central Intelligence Agency relating to covert operations.
That arrangement, in turn, was superseded by the oversight provisions of the Intelligence Authorization Act of 1980, which placed the principal responsibility for oversight of intelligence activities, including covert operations, under the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
The Senate Intelligence Committee was established in 1976 in the wake of a series of public disclosures regarding activities of the CIA.
Its creation had been a principal recommendation of the temporary Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to intelligence activities, chaired by Senator Church.
S. Res.
400 mandates that at least two members of the Foreign Relations Committee are to serve as members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
The Committee also is guaranteed referral of the Intelligence Authorization bill, if requested.
Currently, Senator Lugar and Senator Kerry serve as the Committee's ``cross-over'' members.
Under the oversight provision of the Intelligence Authorization Act of 1980, Senate and House Intelligence Committees are charged to ``promptly call to the attention of its respective House, or to any appropriate committee or committees of its respective House, any matter relating to intelligence activities requiring the attention of such House or such committee or committees.''
Transfers of Jurisdiction    With the informal acquiescence of the Senate, there have been instances in which transfers of jurisdiction have taken place.
For instance, the language of the Reorganization Act of 1946 assigned to Foreign Relations jurisdiction over ``international financial and monetary organizations.''
Yet in 1947 the respective chairmen of the Senate Banking and Currency and Foreign Relations committees agreed that since the Banking and Currency Committee originally handled the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, it would continue to consider legislation pertaining to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund.
In 1959, however, the Committee on Foreign Relations asserted its jurisdiction over these and subsequently established organizations such as the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.
Conversely, the St. Lawrence Seaway legislation, initially referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations since agreement with a foreign nation was involved, in time became essentially domestic in nature.
Thus, jurisdiction over seaway legislation has passed to the Environment and Public Works Committee, with the Foreign Relations Committee reserving its jurisdiction over international aspects.
Committee Powers and Responsibilities    The principal areas of committee responsibilities can be broadly broken down as follows: (1) executive--recommending the advice and consent to treaties and nominations; (2) legislative--consideration of bills and resolutions; and (3) legislative oversight.
There is, however, no hard and fast distinction between these activities since treaties, bills, and resolutions cannot be considered without exercising a degree of legislative oversight in the process.
War Powers    The War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 over the veto of President Nixon.
The initiative came from Senator Jacob K. Javits within the Foreign Relations Committee, where extensive hearings were held.
The resolution arose out of a concern that the power to declare war, as exclusively reserved to the Congress by the Constitution in article I, section 8, had eroded in modern times with Presidents assuming virtual independence from congressional constraints.
The thrust of the resolution (Public Law 93-148) was to insure that the collective judgment of the Congress would be brought to bear on decisions involving the activities of United States Armed Forces which could lead to ongoing hostilities.
It established a time limit for any military involvement in hostilities which were not affirmatively authorized by Congress, as well as a procedure through which the authority of Congress could be exercised to terminate U.S. involvement in hostilities at any stage.
Attention and some disagreement have focused on the resolution's provisions concerning Presidential consultation with Congress in advance of military initiatives and Presidential reporting on the circumstances and justification for military actions within 48 hours after their occurrence.
The Foreign Relations Committee has the principal responsibility for oversight of these matters within the Senate.
Treaties and Other International Agreements    Treaties have traditionally constituted a large part of the Committee's work.
\6\ Recently the number of treaties submitted for approval has averaged over 50 per Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \6\ Treaties and Other International Agreements: The Role of the United States Senate, (See Appendix VI, Bibliography, page 119).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    During the postwar period, however, the number and importance of executive agreements increased noticeably, leading to congressional action in this field to increase timely oversight of such agreements.
(1) Treaties    Senate responsibility for treaties stems directly from article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the President ``shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.''
The making of treaties involves a series of steps which generally include negotiation, signing, approval by the Senate, ratification by the President, deposit or exchange of ratifications with the other party(ies) to the treaty, and proclamation.
Only upon the latter step does a treaty become legally binding upon the United States.
The Senate is associated in this process principally at the ``advice and consent'' to ratification stage.
Contrary to popular impression, the Senate does not ratify treaties; the President ratifies treaties upon receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification.
While the emphasis historically has been on the ``consent'' part of this clause, beginning in the immediate postwar period the Committee has repeatedly stressed the ``advice'' part and claimed a right to advise the President in the negotiation of treaties and the conduct of diplomacy.
This interest has at times led to the formal adoption of Senate resolutions of advice, which are briefly discussed elsewhere.
In performing its consent function to treaties the Senate has several options.
Normally, the procedure for unconditional approval of a treaty is by adoption of a resolution of ratification which in the case of the limited nuclear test ban treaty reads as follows:          Be it resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present         concurring therein), That the Senate advise and consent         to the ratification of the treaty banning nuclear         weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and         under water, which was signed at Moscow on August 5,         1963, on behalf of the United States of America, the         United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland, and         the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Conditions and stipulations.
--The Senate may also qualify its approval of a treaty by requiring amendments to the text of the treaty itself, or more frequently, by imposing conditions known as reservations, understandings, declarations or provisos.
The vehicle for this Senate action is the resolution of ratification, accession or acceptance which accompanies the treaty to the Senate floor from the Committee on Foreign Relations.
According to generally accepted definitions, ``amendments'' and ``reservations'' are proposed revisions in the obligations undertaken by the United States.
``Amendments'' are proposed changes in the actual text of the treaty.
``Reservations'' are specific qualifications or stipulations which change U.S. obligations without necessarily changing treaty text.
``Amendments'' and ``reservations'' imposed by the Senate must be included in the U.S. instrument of treaty ratification in order to provide notice to our treaty partners of the Senate action.
If the President or a treaty partner disagrees with the Senate's conditions, renegotiation of the treaty, consultations among the parties, or other action may be taken to resolve differences.
In contrast, ``understandings'' are interpretative statements intended to clarify or elaborate, rather than amend, treaty text or undertakings.
``Understandings'' provide importance guidance to treaty partners, U.S. judges or other parties who may find it necessary to construe the Senate's intent concerning the relevant treaty.
Generally, ``understandings'' must also be included in the relevant U.S. instrument of ratification to ensure that our treaty partner understands the Senate's positions.
``Declarations,'' ``provisos,'' or other statements also reveal the Senate's position, opinion or intentions about matters related to the treaty in question, but generally not about its specific provisions.
``Declarations,'' ``provisos,'' and like statements are generally omitted from the instruments of treaty ratification which the U.S. government deposits with treaty partners in order to bring treaties into force, because they do not affect the treaty relationship to the same extent as ``amendments'' or ``understandings.''
In recent years, the Senate made extensive use of conditions in approving treaties.
For example, in approving the Chemical Weapons Convention, it included 28 conditions in the resolution of ratification.
Resolutions for several other treaties, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Amended Mines Protocol, and the Flank Document Agreement to the CFE Treaty, also contained significant conditions relating to a variety of issues.
The Senate also made extensive use of such conditions with the Panama Canal treaties in 1978 and the SALT II Treaty in 1979.
The final resolution of ratification on the first Panama Canal Treaty, the so-called ``Neutrality Treaty,'' included two amendments, six reservations, and five understandings, while the second treaty was approved with six reservations and six understandings.
In the Committee's consideration of the SALT II Treaty, a somewhat different format was used for the resolution of ratification, but the total number of conditions and stipulations reported by the Committee was more than twenty.
In addition, during the chairmanship of Senator Jesse Helms, the Committee on Foreign Relations routinely included a variety of additional conditions corresponding to several different kinds of treaties.
For example, with extradition or mutual legal assistance treaties, conditions were included to forbid United States cooperation with the eventual International Criminal Court contemplated in the July 17, 1998 Rome Statute, or release of information to foreign officials suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.
Treaties reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations during Senator Helms' chairmanship also include routinely a proviso reiterating the supremacy of the United States Constitution.
To emphasize the Senate's strong views about the principles of treaty interpretation, by the end of the 106th Congress, the Committee also routinely included in all resolutions of ratification a declaration incorporating by reference the principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and Condition (8) of the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed Among the States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.
This condition, known as the ``Biden-Byrd Condition,'' sets forth the constitutional principle that treaty interpretation will be governed by the ``shared understandings'' of the Executive and the Senate, as reflected in the Executive's formal representations to the Senate at the time the Senate gives its advice and consent.
The Senate may also reject a treaty completely by failing to approve it with the necessary two-thirds vote.
Few treaties have been rejected over the years.
In the 106th Congress, on October 13, 1999, the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.
On March 8, 1983, the Senate rejected the Montreal Protocols to the Warsaw Convention on passenger carriage by air.
The only other treaties rejected by the Senate during the last century were the protocol to the 1958 Geneva Law of the Sea Convention concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes which was rejected on May 26, 1960 by a vote of 49 to 30; U.S. adherence to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which was rejected on January 29, 1935, by a vote of 52 to 36; and the St. Lawrence Seaway, which was rejected on March 14, 1934, by a vote of 46 to 42.
(The Seaway was subsequently authorized by Public Law 83-358, approved May 13, 1954.)
Procedure.
--Before formal Senate consideration of a treaty may begin, the treaty must be transmitted to the Senate by the President for advice and consent.
All treaties transmitted by the President to the Senate for advice and consent are referred to the Committee.
Treaties conceivably could remain on the Committee calendar indefinitely absent action to approve them, reject them, or to return them to the President.
Treaties reported by the Committee remain on the Senate's Executive Calendar for the duration of a Congress, or until otherwise disposed of.
At the end of a Congress, treaties which remain on the Senate's Executive Calendar are automatically re-referred to the Committee in accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2.
From time to time, Presidents may request the return of treaties pending before the Committee or the Senate, or the Committee itself may take the initiative to return certain treaties to the President.
In either case, the usual procedure is for the Committee to report an executive resolution to the full Senate authorizing the return of the treaty or treaties to the President.
That procedure is unusual, and was followed most recently in the 106th Congress, when the Committee reported Senate Resolution 267, directing the return of eighteen treaties to the President.
Senate action on reservations, understandings, interpretations, statements, or amendments requires a majority of those present and voting.
Final adoption of the resolution of ratification, however, requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.
While there is no Senate rule requiring a roll call vote on treaties, the practice of taking record votes was begun in 1953 after press attention during the previous year to the fact that three noncontroversial consular conventions were approved by the Senate at a time when only two Senators were present.
\7\ The requirement for a record vote was also a part of the Bricker amendment maneuvers and was adopted as a de facto practice to weaken support for the Bricker amendment.
However, in recent years, the Senate has resumed the practice of approving non-controversial resolutions of ratification for treaties by voice vote.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \7\ A discussion of this incident appears in ``A Note on Treaty Ratification,'' by Carl Marcy in The American Political Science Review, vol.
XLVII, No. 4, December 1953, p. 1130.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Although generally there is a separate vote on each treaty, when a large number of similar treaties (fisheries, double taxation conventions, customs treaties, etc.) is on the executive calendar it has become a practice to consider them either ``en bloc''--that is, one vote on several resolutions of ratification--or to have a single vote, which, by unanimous consent, is shown separately in the Record for each treaty.
This latter technique has been used at times even in the case of dissimilar treaties, over which no controversy existed, in order to expedite the business of the Senate.
The Committee's treaty calendar is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the pending business before the Committee, because some treaties may have little prospect of Senate action.
For instance, in 1947, at the beginning of the 80th Congress, the Committee had 24 treaties pending before it, dating as far back as 1923.
At the request of the chairman, Senator Vandenberg, the administration reviewed the treaty calendar and requested the return of 19 of these treaties, which was granted.
These reviews have continued to take place from time to time as the occasion demands.
At the close of the 106th Congress, the oldest treaty pending on the Committee's calendar dated to August 27, 1949 (Treaty Doc.
81-19).
Although treaties sometimes pend before the Committee for considerable periods, the great majority of treaties are promptly and favorably disposed of.
In this connection, it has become the Committee's practice to leave a treaty pending for a sufficient period to allow the public time to study the treaty and to inform the Committee of its views and interest in testifying on the treaty in question.
(2) Other International Agreements    International agreements other than treaties--so-called executive agreements--have been used by Presidents since the earliest days of the Republic.
Beginning with World War II the number and importance of such agreements burgeoned, leading to an increasing concern on the part of Congress about the constitutionality of commitments made in this manner.
The loose use of the word ``commitment'' to justify overseas interventions finally led the Senate, on June 25, 1969, to adopt a statement of what it considered to be a ``national commitment.''
The problem was explored in hearings and executive session consideration over a period beginning in 1967.
These touched on such subjects as the 1940 destroyer-for-bases deal, the British-French-United States tripartite declaration of 1950 on the Middle East, the so-called contingency plan for Thailand, and base agreements.
In 1969, the Senate concurred in the Committee's recommendation of the ``National Commitments Resolution,'' which resolved:          That (1) a national commitment for the purpose of         this resolution means the use of the Armed Forces of         the United States on foreign territory, or a promise to         assist a foreign country, government, or people by the         use of the Armed Forces or financial resources of the         United States, either immediately or upon the happening         of certain events, and (2) it is the sense of the         Senate that a national commitment by the United States         results only from affirmative action taken by the         executive and legislative branches of the United States         Government by means of a treaty, statute, or concurrent         resolution of both Houses of Congress specifically         providing for such commitment.
(S. Res.
85, 91st Cong.)
One of the first concrete instances to engage the Committee's attention after adoption of the National Commitment Resolution was the extension of the so-called Spanish base agreement on August 6, 1970.
As the Committee viewed it, this agreement contained an implicit commitment to defend Spain in the event of an attack, as well as substantial financial support for the Spanish Government.
The Committee felt strongly that the agreement partook of the nature of a treaty and should be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, and so advised the State Department.
The executive branch proceeded otherwise, however, and after a series of executive and public hearings in which the Committee was assured that the agreement entailed no U.S. commitment to defend Spain, the Senate, on the Committee's recommendation, adopted a resolution (S. Res.
469, 91st Cong., agreed to December 11, 1970) stating its sense that ``nothing in the said agreement * * * shall be deemed to be a national commitment by the United States.''
In time, however, the Senate's expressions were taken into account and the renewal of the Spanish base agreement was submitted as a treaty in 1976.
The Case Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-403) addressed itself directly to executive agreements and provides in part--          The Secretary of State shall transmit to the Congress         the text of any international agreement (including the         text of any oral international agreement, which         agreement shall be reduced to writing), other than a         treaty, to which the United States is a party as soon         as practicable after such agreement has entered into         force with respect to the United States but in no event         later than sixty days thereafter.
In the event such agreements are classified, they are to be transmitted instead to the Committees on Foreign Relations of the Senate and International Relations of the House under an appropriate injunction of secrecy.
The Committee viewed the Act as ``a significant step toward redressing the imbalance between Congress and the executive in the making of foreign policy * * * '' and ``an effective means of dealing with the prior question of secrecy and of asserting the obligation of the executive to report its foreign commitments to Congress.''
In 1978, the Case Act was further amended to make clear the inclusion of oral agreements, to designate the Secretary of State as the official within the executive branch who decides what constitutes an international agreement, and to require a formal explanation from the President when agreements are not properly transmitted before the sixty-day deadline.
Contrary to a widespread public perception, however, the Case Act does not provide for congressional veto of international agreements and does not require affirmative action by the Congress to approve international agreements before they enter into force.
Nominations    The Committee's responsibility with respect to nominations, like that with respect to treaties, arises from article II, section 2, paragraph 2, of the Constitution (previously cited, page 3, above).
Pursuant to this provision, the Senate refers to the Committee nominations of officials to positions in the Department of State, ambassadors and ministers, representatives to international organizations, and officials to other positions established by laws which are within the jurisdiction of the Committee.
These include positions in the Agency for International Development, the Peace Corps, U.S. representatives in the various international banking institutions, and advisory bodies to these agencies.
Appointments, promotions, and designations of Foreign Service Officers, as well, are referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and constitute the bulk, numerically, of the nominations handled.
For instance, in the 106th Congress, approximately 2000 nominations were referred to the Committee of which nearly 1800 were career officer promotions.
A detailed description of the confirmation requirements and processes, together with relevant case histories, is set forth in the committee print, ``The Senate Role in Foreign Affairs Appointments.''
\8\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \8\ The Senate Role in Foreign Affairs Appointments, (See Appendix VI, bibliography, page 119).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Available Committee records do not show the last time the Senate rejected a nomination within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee.
It may have been in 1889 when ``the Senate refused to confirm Benjamin Harrison's nomination of Murat Halstead, an Ohio journalist, as Minister to Germany, because of a series of articles he had written denouncing the purchase of Senate seats.''
\9\ However, one nominee, Ernest W. Lefever, withdrew his own name from consideration as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs after an adverse vote in Committee in June 1981.
In March 1983, the nomination of Kenneth Adelman to be U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) Director was reported unfavorably by the Committee, but was approved by the Senate by a vote of 57-42.
Other nominations have been withdrawn by the President as a result of controversies surrounding them, while still others have simply not been acted on by the Committee or the Senate, as, for instance, the withdrawal in 1973 of the nomination of G. Mc
Murtrie Godley to be Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and the non-action in 1974 on the nomination of Graham Martin to be Ambassador at Large for Micronesian negotiations and five others to be members of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's General Advisory Committee.
More recently, in 1997 the nomination of William Weld to be Ambassador to Mexico was withdrawn after the chairman prevailed in his decision not to schedule a hearing on the nomination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \9\ Harris, The Advice and Consent of the Senate, p. 291 (See Appendix VI, bibliography, page 119).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    All nominations not confirmed or rejected by the end of a session lapse with the adjournment or recess of the Senate for more than 30 days, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.
The President has the power to issue recess appointments when he deems it desirable.
Such recess appointments, however, have to be submitted to the Senate not later than 40 days after the commencement of the next session in order for the incumbent to continue to receive a salary (5 U.S.C. 5503).
The Committee on Foreign Relations has been continually interested in the caliber and qualifications of nominees.
The rules adopted by the Committee to govern its consideration of nominations appear on page 30.
On January 14, 1953, the Committee adopted a rule requiring an FBI investigation of nominees prior to the submission of names to the Senate.
Only twice has the question of Committee access to the FBI files themselves come up.
In the first case, that of Charles E. Bohlen in 1953, a subcommittee of two Senators reviewed a summary of the FBI file.
In the second, that of Helmut Sonnenfeldt in 1973, a staff member was authorized to review his security files.
In 1981, however, the Committee adopted a policy of requesting access for any member of the Committee who wished to review summaries of such files.
On February 17, 1953, the Committee adopted a six-day rule, which calls for the passage of six calendar days after the receipt of a nomination by the Senate before the Committee will consider the nomination.
This rule has been waived occasionally, mainly in the case of career appointments when the nominee was already abroad, in situations of urgent need to get the nominee to his post, or in the case of nominations received just before congressional adjournment.
At about the same time, in 1953 the Committee commenced the practice of examining the appointees to all important positions in Washington and abroad whenever possible.
Prior to this time hearings, executive or open, were held on a nomination only when someone requested to be heard on the nomination, and not as a matter of regular procedure.
The practice initiated in 1953 was acknowledged and further refined on July 30, 1957, when the Committee adopted a motion ``that from now on all nominees for ambassadorial and ministerial posts be heard in open session unless a majority of the Committee decrees otherwise.''
By custom, the Committee has allowed any committee members to request that any nominee be held off the agenda of a business meeting with the understanding that the nominee would be considered at the next meeting.
In 1972 the Committee increased the number of nominations to be submitted to it by providing that the names of all persons granted the rank of ambassador be submitted for confirmation ``except that the personal rank of ambassador or minister may be conferred by the President in connection with special missions for the President of an essentially limited and temporary nature of not exceeding six months.''
That provision was further modified by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require advance notice of Presidential intent to nominate such ambassadors with personal rank and to provide justifications for these appointments.
The age-old question of political contributions by ambassadorial nominees was dealt with in the Department of State Authorization Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-126, signed October 18, 1973).
Sec.
6 of that act required that each person appointed by the President as ambassador or minister should file a report of contributions made by such persons and by members of his immediate family.
The Act of 1974 added the further requirement that ``The Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate shall have printed in the Congressional Record each such report.''
However, these provisions were revised by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465, signed October 17, 1980).
Sec.
304(b)(2) of that act provides that:          Each individual nominated by the President to be a         chief of mission, ambassador at large, or minister         shall, at the time of nomination, file with the         Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the         Speaker of the House of Representatives a report of         contributions made by such individual and by members of         his or her immediate family during the period beginning         on the first day of the fourth calendar year preceding         the calendar year of the nomination and ending on the         date of the nomination.
The report shall be verified by         the oath of the nominee, taken before any individual         authorized to administer oaths.
The chairman of the         Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate shall have         each such report printed in the Congressional Record.
As used in this paragraph, the term ``contribution''         has the same meaning given such term by section 301(8)         of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C.         431(8)) and the term ``immediate family'' means the         spouse of the nominee, and any child, parent,         grandparent, brother, or sister of the nominee and the         spouses of any of them.
Section 304(4) of the 1980 Act also established the new requirement that:          (4) The President shall provide the Committee on         Foreign Relations of the Senate with each nomination         for an appointment as a chief of mission, a report on         the demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform         the duties of the position in which he or she is to         serve.
The report of demonstrated competence, which sets forth the rationale for the selection and assignment of the chief of mission, is now provided to the Committee as a matter of regular course by the State Department prior to the scheduling of the prospective nominee's confirmation hearing.
Subsequent amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 also provided for reporting campaign contributions and overlap to a certain degree those of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act.
At present, the Committee requires each nominee to file a signed statement prior to his confirmation hearing, covering the following areas: (A) Biographical Information, (B) Financial Information (including a confidential statement), (C) Future Employment Plans, (D) Conflict of Interest, and (E) Ethical Matters.
Bills and Resolutions    Since the document, ``How a Bill Becomes a Law,'' issued periodically by Congress, describes the legislative process in detail, only a few aspects of it will be noted here.
Legislative matters are comprised of bills, joint resolutions, concurrent resolutions and resolutions.
Bills and joint resolutions both become law upon signature by the President and therefore carry equal weight.
The basic distinction between them is a matter of intent.
Bills are the most widely used legislative vehicles; joint resolutions are used mainly for the approval of international agreements, membership in international organizations, and expressing views of both Houses of Congress that are meant to have the force of law.
Concurrent and simple resolutions express the sense of the Congress in the former case and the sense of the Senate or the House in the latter case.
They do not require signature by the President and therefore do not have the force of law.
Simple resolutions, while in a sense the lowest form of congressional action, can at times carry considerable weight, such as the Connally and Fulbright resolutions of 1943 pledging U.S. participation in a post World War II international organization; the Vandenberg resolution of 1948 which presaged the formation of NATO; and the National Commitments Resolution of 1969 which defined what the Senate will consider to be a commitment binding on the United States.
In fact one Senate resolution was deemed to be so important as to have the nature of a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote for adoption--the 1946 resolution by which the Senate advised the President to accept on behalf of the United States the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in certain matters.
The use of Senate resolutions to advise the President, under the advice and consent clause of the Constitution, has become relatively widespread in the postwar period, as previously noted.
To give such advice the maximum weight possible, the Committee has made it a practice to append a provision directing the Secretary of the Senate to transmit the resolution to the President for appropriate action and for a report on such action to the Senate within a specified time period.
The most important recurring legislative responsibilities of the Committee are the bi-annual authorization bills for agencies and programs under the Committee's jurisdiction--principally the State Department, Agency for International Development, Peace Corps, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
With the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, all standing committees are required to submit to the Committee on the Budget, by March 15 each year, their estimates of the total amounts of new budget authority to be provided in such authorizing legislation, in order to enable the Senate, by May 15, to pass the first concurrent resolution on the Budget, setting levels of government spending and revenue for the fiscal year ahead.
All authorizing legislation must also be reported to the Senate by the same date.
Any money-carrying bills reported after May 15 are subject to a point of order unless a waiver is obtained by the adoption of a resolution by the Senate.
These new procedures, which went fully into effect in 1976, are designed to give the Congress a better overview of the expected outlays and also revenues for the upcoming year.
They have also affected the Committee's scheduling of legislation and other matters to give early priority to the so called money bills.
Committee procedures with respect to bills, joint, concurrent and simple resolutions are the same.
The Committee files written reports on major matters it sends to the Senate.
Pursuant to the Foreign Relations Committee (and Senate procedures), Committee reports are technically prepared and submitted by the Chairman of the Committee.
Therefore the Chairman maintains the ``power of the pen'' in drafting reports of the Foreign Relations Committee and there technically is no requirement for the Chairman to consult with the ranking member, or with any other Senator, in the preparation of such documents.
Senators who do not concur with the views expressed by the Chairman in the Committee report, or who wish to add additional views of their own, are afforded the opportunity to append their views as separate and distinct annexes to the actual report.
However, as a practical matter, most committee reports are negotiated with the ranking member and reflect his views, in addition to those of the Chairman.
It has been the practice in recent years to allow clear differentiation of views on contentious issues within the main text of the report, rather than shunting alternate views into appendices to the Chairman's report.
Examples of this include Exec.
Rept.
104-10, the Committee's report on the resolution of ratification for START II that reflects differing views on the merits of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and on the importance of missile defense.
In the case of the Committee report that was submitted in connection with the resolution of ratification for the Chemical Weapons Convention (Exec.
Rept.
104-33), the Chairman allowed proponents of the treaty to prepare their own section of the report and to title it ``Majority Views.''
The Chairman, who opposed the treaty, prepared an alternate section of the report and titled it ``Minority Views.''
This unusual formulation was proposed by Senator Helms since he had agreed to schedule Committee consideration of the CWC despite his personal objections to this treaty.
The Chairman nevertheless maintains final decisionmaking authority over the contents of all aspects of any Committee report (other than Minority or Additional Views).
However, the Committee in recent years has sought to reflect the general practice of comity among Senators, even on issues as contentious as the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Occasionally the Committee has filed adverse reports, recommending that a measure not be adopted.
Senate Resolution 116, by Senator Joe Mc
Carthy of Wisconsin, would have expressed the sense of the Senate that prior to any conference between heads of state (referring to the proposed Geneva Summit Conference in 1955), the Secretary of State should secure the agreement of other parties at the Conference that one of the subjects for discussion should be the present and future status of the nations of Eastern Europe and Asia then under Communist control.
The Committee's adverse finding was sustained by the Senate on June 22, 1955, by a vote of 4 to 77.
Instances of adverse Committee reports were on a concurrent resolution disapproving of the proposed sale of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan in 1981, a joint resolution dealing with nuclear arms reductions in 1983, and a joint resolution concerning sales of avionics system kits to China in 1986.
It should be noted that the Senate does not always sustain the Committee's adverse finding.
As a general rule, measures of which the Committee does not approve are either tabled, held over, or postponed without any written explanation.
However, in October 1983, the Committee reported unfavorably two joint resolutions concerning nuclear arms control.
While portions of the resolutions were considered by the Senate, action on the resolutions was not taken.
The Committee has occasionally reported a measure without recommendation, such as: the first International Wheat Agreement in 1948; a St. Lawrence Seaway bill in 1952; in 1965 H.R. 30, a bill authorizing U.S. participation in a cultural and trade center in Florida; in 1968, an amendment to the Agriculture Act of 1956 relating to long-staple cotton, which was subsequently pocket-vetoed; S. Con.
Res.
86 relating to sales of armaments to Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia in 1978; in 1979 a concurrent resolution opposing sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia; in 1981 a bill seeking a particular form of legislative settlement for outstanding property claims against the Government of Czechoslovakia.
In 1999, legislation was introduced by Senator John Mc
Cain that was determined by the Senate Parliamentarian to have met the standard of the War Powers Resolution.
Rather than allow the legislation to be automatically discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee, the committee met to consider the legislation, and reported it without recommendation.
Legislative Oversight Activities    The Committee on Foreign Relations, along with other standing committees, is specifically charged with exercising legislative oversight by Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, which reads as follows:          8.
(a) In order to assist the Congress in--                  (1) its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation                 of the application, administration, and                 execution of the laws enacted by the Congress,                 and                  (2) its formulation, consideration, and                 enactment of such modifications of or changes                 in those laws, and of such additional                 legislation, as may be necessary or                 appropriate,        each standing committee (except the committees on         Appropriations and the Budget), shall review and study,         on a continuing basis, the application, administration,         and execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the         subject matter of which is within the legislative         jurisdiction of that committee.
Such committees may         carry out the required analysis, appraisal, and         evaluation themselves, or by contract, or may require a         Government agency to do so and furnish a report thereon         to the Senate.
Such committees may rely on such         techniques as pilot testing, analysis of costs in         comparison with benefits or provision for evaluation         after a defined period of time.
(b) In each odd-numbered year each such committee         shall submit, not later than March 31, to the Senate, a         report on the activities of that committee under this         paragraph during the Congress ending at noon on January         3 of such year.
It has already been noted that in recent years the Committee's legislative oversight activities have burgeoned.
This has resulted from a variety of factors--the increasing number of programs within the Committee's jurisdiction, the numerous provisions in laws requiring the submission of determinations and reports, the transmittal of executive agreements as of 1973 and of budget rescissions and deferrals as of 1975, the notifications of proposed arms sales and arms transfers, reporting under the War Powers Resolution, submission of arms control impact statements, and other factors.
A few statistics will serve to illustrate this growth.
During the 92d Congress, 83 communications from the executive branch in the foreign affairs area were received by the Senate and referred to the Foreign Relations Committee.
This number increased to 184 in the 93d Congress and reached over 500 at the end of the 106th Congress.
During the 93rd Congress, 396 executive agreements (not including classified agreements) were referred to the Committee; in the 98th Congress this number jumped to 461 and stood at approximately 300 by the end of the 106th Congress.
Thirty-one messages advising of budget rescissions and deferrals had been received during the 94th Congress as against none the previous Congresses.
During the 106th Congress, approximately 11 messages advising of budget rescissions and deferrals were received.
Finally, in the 94th Congress, the Committee had received over 250 reports required by provisions of various laws whereas in the 106th Congress well over 2100 reports were received.
The Committee is responsible for having this mass of material analyzed and for proposing remedial action where deemed necessary.
Such action can take the form of amendments to existing laws or by means of a resolution of disapproval, as is provided for in such laws as the Arms Export Control Act.
This area of Committee operations is largely invisible since only when some question is raised about an executive branch proposal does public action result, as for instance over the projected sale of Hawk missiles to Jordan and of Airborne Warning Aircraft to NATO in 1976 or armaments to Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in 1978, and again to Saudi Arabia in 1981.
The Committee has developed varying techniques in exercising legislative oversight: scrutiny of foreign aid allocations and arms sales through the congressionally mandated notification process; day-to-day personal contacts with administration officials; correspondence with officials growing out of difficulties brought to the Committee's attention by the public or Government employees (a collection of such correspondence relating to the State Department was published in 1960 under the title ``Administration of the Department of State'' and supplemented in 1962); on-the-spot inspections abroad by Committee members or staff (generally followed by reports, either printed or confidential, to the Committee); special short-term studies of foreign policy problems (such as the investigation of events relating to the Dominican Republic intervention in 1965, U.S. security interests and policies in Southwest Asia in 1980, military presence in Panama in 1997, and the multiple afflictions facing Sudan in 1998); public hearings on proposals such as nuclear reactor sales to South Africa in 1976; and the establishment of special subcommittees to study in depth a particular area, problem, or program.
Activities of legislative oversight subcommittees are described elsewhere.
Contacts with administration officials can be formal or informal and normally take place at all levels throughout the year.
It is customary for the Secretary of State to launch this process at the beginning of a year by giving the Committee a world review soon after the Congress convenes.
It is also customary for the Secretary to appear before the Committee before the United States exercises military force and during times of international crisis.
Heads of other departments, officers of the Armed Forces, under secretaries, assistant secretaries, and American ambassadors on Washington visits appear likewise on problems within their areas of responsibilities either before the full Committee or the appropriate subcommittee.
Travel by Committee members and staff also serves the oversight function.
Indeed Committee members are encouraged to visit other countries and to meet with government officials and other leaders in those countries in order to evaluate the effectiveness of United States overseas programs and meet their legislative oversight responsibilities.
Members and staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations are required to report their findings to the Committee, and these reports are frequently printed as committee documents.
The official travel expenses of members of the Committee and staff are paid either from the contingent fund of the Senate or by the use of U.S.-owned foreign currencies which are available to appropriate committees of the Congress engaged in carrying out their duties under the Standing Rules of the Senate.
In accordance with Sec.
502 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, and 22 U.S.C. 1754(b), as amended, each Senator and committee staff member who uses funds is required to submit an itemized report showing the amounts expended and the purposes for which expended.
Such reports are open to public inspection.
Also in the line of legislative oversight, as well as advising the executive, Senators and Representatives have been appointed to delegations, or as congressional advisers, to international conferences.
This practice began as early as 1814, when President Madison appointed Senator Thomas F. Bayard and Representative Henry Clay as two of the five members of the Peace Commission which negotiated the Treaty of Ghent.
It was more marked throughout the 1900's, beginning with the appointments of Senators Connally and Vandenberg and Representatives Bloom and Eaton to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco in 1945.
It was customary for the State Department to ask the Presiding Officer of the Senate to designate Senators to attend meetings of the governing bodies of U.N. specialized agencies; important conferences, such as the sessions of the Law of the Sea Conference; and special sessions of the U.N. General Assembly such as those sessions on disarmament and the environment.
In this capacity, Senators serve as congressional advisers and gain some insight into the work of the organizations, including budget and financing questions.
At the same time, they have an opportunity to share the concerns of the U.S. Congress on these issues.
This practice diminished in the 1990's as congressional participation on U.S. delegations to international meetings has been directed more to those with significant domestic implications.
For example, some of the 12 Senators appointed to the Global Climate Change Observer Group attended the December 1997 meeting at Kyoto, Japan, on the Protocol on the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Control.
Most international organizations also have annual or biennial meetings of their membership, and it has become customary also to include Members of Congress in the U.S. delegations to those sessions as observers or advisers, when deemed desirable.
For instance, a few years after the United Nations came into being an informal arrangement was made between the House, Senate, and the Department of State whereby in non-election years, two members of the House International Relations Committee would be on the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, and in election years, two Senators, generally members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would be U.S. delegates.
The Senators serving on the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly have been as follows:    1946--Senators Connally and Vandenberg.
1947--Senators Vandenberg and Connally.
1950--Senators Sparkman (not a committee member) and Lodge.
1952--Senators Green and Wiley.
1954--Senators (H. Alexander) Smith and Fulbright    1956--Senators Humphrey and Knowland.
1958--Senators Mansfield and Hickenlooper.
1960--Senators Morse and Aiken.
1962--Senators Gore and Allott (not a committee member).
1964--Senators (Russell B.) Long and Carlson.
1966--Senators Church and (Clifford P.) Case.
1968--Senators Symington and Cooper.
1970--Senators Pell and Javits.

Interparliamentary Activities    Interparliamentary activities concern and involve the entire Congress.
For instance, every Member of Congress is ipso facto a member of the Interparliamentary Union.
Legislation authorizing the participation in such activities, however, has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and it is, therefore, more directly responsible and involved than other committees.
Moreover, as the principal committee dealing with international relations, the Committee has taken an active interest in assuring adequate preparation and representation at the various interparliamentary meetings.
In addition, Public Law 86-42 and Public Law 86-420, which authorize participation in the Canada-United States and the Mexico-United States Interparliamentary Groups, respectively, include the provision that not less than four of the 12 Senators appointed by the President of the Senate to participate in such meetings be from the Foreign Relations Committee.
And in 1975, an amendment to the Act authorizing U.S. participation in the Interparliamentary Union specified that no less than two of the delegates shall be members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The oldest formally organized interparliamentary body is the Interparliamentary Union, to which all nations with national parliamentary bodies may apply for membership.
The Congress has participated in the Union since its establishment in 1889.
Current legislative authority for such participation dates from 1935.
The next oldest group with which the U.S. Congress has been associated is the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, formed as the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1911.
Although the Congress is, of course, not a member of this organization, the association has made it a practice to invite Congress to participate in that portion of its annual meetings devoted to a discussion of international issues.
These invitations have been accepted by the Senate upon occasion.
Senate resolutions have been passed to authorize participation.
U.S. participation in the North Atlantic Assembly, formerly the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference, was authorized in 1956 on a permanent basis.
The law provides for the appointment of not to exceed 24 Members of the Congress (12 from each House) to each conference (Public Law 84-689).
The Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group is an outgrowth of discussions in 1959 between United States and Canadian legislators authorized by Senate Resolution 359 in 1958.
Following these initial discussions, participation by the United States in parliamentary conferences with Canada was authorized on a permanent basis by Public Law 86-42, enacted in 1959.
The appointment each year of not to exceed 12 Senators and 12 Representatives is authorized for this purpose.
The participating countries alternate in acting as host to the conferences.
To balance the arrangement with its northern neighbor, the U.S. Congress in 1960 approved similar participation in a Mexico-United States Interparliamentary Group by Public Law 86-420.
In addition to the formal or regular meetings of the above-described organizations, there are other contacts on informal or irregular basis.
For instance, the Council of Europe has occasionally invited Members of Congress to meet with it.
Likewise, it has become customary for a small congressional group to meet some years with a similar group from the British Parliament.
In 1974, 1978 and 1985, the Congress entertained a parliamentary delegation from the Soviet Union.
Additional bilateral exchanges have been suggested by certain countries and invitations for congressional visits have been received from others.
In 1965, for the first time, the Senate, at the recommendation of the Committee, adopted a resolution authorizing the President of the Senate to respond, for the duration of the 89th Congress, to invitations officially received from foreign governmental or parliamentary bodies by naming official Senate delegates to accept such invitations and providing for the payment of expenses of such delegations, not to exceed $25,000 per delegation.
Similar resolutions covering the 90th Congress (S. Res.
115) and the 91st Congress (S. Res.
65) were passed by the Senate on May 19, 1967, and February 17, 1969, respectively.
After a lapse of five years, this authority was renewed in 1975 (S. Res.
86, agreed to February 24, 1975) and the financial ceiling raised to $35,000 per delegation.
Delegation expenses are now paid out of the Senate's contingency fund (S. Res.
179, approved May 25, 1977).
To deal with the reverse flow of official visitors to the United States, the Senate on March 6, 1958 agreed to S. Res.
259, which provided $5,000 ``to provide assistance to Members of the Senate in the discharge of their responsibilities in connection with visiting foreign dignitaries, and for other purposes.''
In March 1975, the amount was raised to $10,000 to cover the cost of inflation, the increase in the number of visitors, and to include officials of Intergovernmental Organizations in addition to foreign government officials.
In June 1976 this sum was further raised to $15,000 in view of the large bicentennial influx of foreign dignitaries, and in 1977 to $25,000.
In 2000, the Senate agreed to S. Res.
370 which increased the amount to $30,000.
Committee Procedure    Up to the time of enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, the Committee on Foreign Relations had no formal rules of procedure additional to those contained in the earlier Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.
The new act, however, provided that all committees, standing, select, or special, adopt rules and publish them in the Congressional Record no later than March 1 of each year (now Rule XXVI.2 of the Standing Rules of the Senate).
The most recent rules are as follows:Rules of the Committee on Foreign Relations                      (adopted february 12, 1999)                          RULE 1--JURISDICTION    (a) Substantive.

Immediately upon filing of the request, the Chief Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the filing of the request.
If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the Chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the Committee may file in the offices of the Committee their written notice that a special meeting of the Committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting.
The Committee shall meet on that date and hour.
Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the Clerk shall notify all members of the Committee that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.

(b) Return.
--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting.

RULE 9--TREATIES    (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent.
Because the House of Representatives has no role in the approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.
(b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate.

RULE 11--TRAVEL    (a) Foreign Travel.
--No member of the Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who is required by law to approve vouchers and report expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Minority Member.
Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 days.
This report shall be furnished to all members of the Committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without the express authorization of the Committee.
Except in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior trips.
Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel.
In addition, members and staff are reminded of Senate Rule XXXV.4 requiring a determination by the Senate Ethics Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored travel.
Any proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking minority member prior to submission of the request to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full Committee.
When the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member approve the foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.
(b) Domestic Travel.
--All official travel in the United States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the Minority Staff Director.
(c) Personal Staff.
--As a general rule, no more than one member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee.
During such travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee of the Committee.
(d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).
--For the purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Furthermore, for the purposes of this section, each Member of the Committee may designate one personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the Member.''
RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS    (a) General.
--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides otherwise.
Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, determines otherwise.

They must never be left unattended and shall be         returned to the Chief Clerk promptly when no longer         needed.
(4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below,         transcripts classified secret or higher may not leave         the Committee offices except for the purpose of         declassification.

(6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking         notes or quotes from classified transcripts.
Their         contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized         person.

Each transcript of a closed session of the         Committee shall include on its cover a description of         the restrictions imposed upon access, as well as any         applicable restrictions upon photocopying, note-taking         or other dissemination.

A record shall be kept of         all such authorizations.
(c) Declassification.
--          (1) All restricted transcripts and classified         Committee reports shall be declassified on a date         twelve years after their origination unless the         Committee by majority vote decides against such         declassification, and provided that the executive         departments involved and all former Committee members         who participated directly in the sessions or reports         concerned have been consulted in advance and given a         reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such         declassification.
(2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or         any portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than         twelve years after their origination if:                  (i) the Chairman originates such action or                 receives a written request for such action, and                 notifies the other members of the Committee;                  (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member,                 and each member or former member who                 participated directly in such meeting or report                 give their approval, except that the Committee                 by majority vote may overrule any objections                 thereby raised to early declassification; and                  (iii) the executive departments and all                 former Committee members are consulted in                 advance and have a reasonable opportunity to                 object to early declassification.
RULE 13--CLASSIFIED MATERIAL    (a) All classified material received or originated by the Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.
(b) Each such piece of classified material received or originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman.
If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show onward receipt.
(c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall be by Committee members or authorized staff only.
All classified material sent to members' offices, and that distributed within the working offices of the Committee, shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief Clerk.
No classified material is to be removed from the offices of the members or of the Committee without permission of the Chairman.
Such classified material will be afforded safe handling and safe storage at all times.
(d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office for use by the members and authorized staff in that office only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.
(e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee responsibilities.
(f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of these regulations.
RULE 14--STAFF    (a) Responsibilities.
--          (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole,         under the general supervision of the Chairman of the         Committee, and the immediate direction of the Staff         Director; provided, however, that such part of the         staff as is designated Minority Staff, shall be under         the general supervision of the Ranking Minority Member         and under the immediate direction of the Minority Staff         Director.
(2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to         call upon the staff at any time for assistance in         connection with Committee business.
Members of the         Senate not members of the Committee who call upon the         staff for assistance from time to time should be given         assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of         the staff to the Committee.
(3) The staff's primary responsibility is with         respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and         nominations.
In addition to carrying out assignments from the         Committee and its individual members, the staff has a         responsibility to originate suggestions for Committee         or subcommittee consideration.
The staff also has a         responsibility to make suggestions to individual         members regarding matters of special interest to such         members.
(4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as         well informed as possible in regard to developments         affecting foreign relations and in regard to the         administration of foreign programs of the United         States.
Significant trends or developments which might         otherwise escape notice should be called to the         attention of the Committee, or of individual Senators         with particular interests.
(5) The staff shall pay due regard to the         constitutional separation of powers between the Senate         and the executive branch.
It therefore has a         responsibility to help the Committee bring to bear an         independent, objective judgment of proposals by the         executive branch and when appropriate to originate         sound proposals of its own.
At the same time, the staff         shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of         foreign affairs.
(6) In those instances when Committee action requires         the expression of minority views, the staff shall         assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end         that all points of view may be fully considered by         members of the Committee and of the Senate.
The staff         shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system         it is the responsibility of the elected Members of the         Senate to determine legislative issues in the light of         as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the         staff may be able to obtain.
(b) Restrictions.
--          (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the         Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the         relationship of a lawyer to a client.
In order to         protect this relationship and the mutual confidence         which must prevail if the Committee-staff relationship         is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following         criteria shall apply:                  (i) members of the staff shall not be                 identified with any special interest group in                 the field of foreign relations or allow their                 names to be used by any such group;                  (ii) members of the staff shall not accept                 public speaking engagements or write for                 publication in the field of foreign relations                 without specific advance permission from the                 Staff Director, or, in the case of minority                 staff, from the Minority Staff Director.
In the                 case of the Staff Director and the Minority                 Staff Director, such advance permission shall                 be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking                 Minority Member, as appropriate.
In any event,                 such public statements should avoid the                 expression of personal views and should not                 contain predictions of future, or                 interpretations of past, Committee action; and                  (iii) staff shall not discuss their private                 conversations with members of the Committee                 without specific advance permission from the                 Senator or Senators concerned.
(2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the         proceedings of the Committee in closed session or         reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a         session unless that person would have been permitted to         attend the session itself, or unless such communication         is specifically authorized by the Staff Director or         Minority Staff Director.
Unauthorized disclosure of         information from a closed session or of classified         information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and         may, in the case of some kinds of information, be         grounds for criminal prosecution.
RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES    (a) Status.
--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency.
In addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.
(b) Amendment.
--These Rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken.
However, Rules of the Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be superseded by Committee vote alone.
______                                     These rules speak for themselves.
It should be noted that attendance of members at Committee meetings is voluntary and not compulsory.
Meetings and Hearings    Committee meetings are held at the call of the chairman.
During consideration of important and complex measures, it is not unusual for the Committee to meet daily, both mornings and afternoons, the Senate permitting.
Under normal circumstances, it is a routine courtesy to give standing committees permission to meet while the Senate is in session.
Thus, for example, the Committee and its subcommittees met some 330 times during the 93rd Congress, 311 times in the 98th Congress, and over 200 times in the 106th Congress.
Meetings and agenda are initiated by the chairman and ranking minority member with the advice of members.
Members have the right to suggest meetings on particular subjects and that certain bills and resolutions be placed on the agenda or scheduled for hearings.
In accordance with Senate rules (S. Res.
9, adopted November 7, 1975), all meetings are open to the public, except when the Committee, by majority vote, decides otherwise.
Because of the sensitive nature of certain of the information required by the Committee, some hearings are voted to be closed to the public.
Briefings by Department of State officials on negotiations in process or of current U.S. policy on various issues, for example, often fall into that category.
The Committee holds hearings on legislation, nominations, treaties, general oversight, and current international situations which are of interest to the Chairman or Subcommittee Chairmen.
By custom, but not by rule, the Committee has permitted administration representatives to appear on the first witness panel, to be followed by one or more panels of private witnesses.
Every effort is made to maintain a two to one witness ratio, with two witnesses on the private panel appearing at the request of the majority for each witness appearing at the request of the minority to ensure that a diversity of views is heard on matters before the Committee.
If there are numerous witnesses to be heard on a particular bill or treaty, the Committee may limit the oral presentation of witnesses to 10 minutes.
The Committee has adopted a time limit for questioning witnesses by its own members so as to give every Senator an equal chance at examining a witness.
On certain occasions, the Committee has also set a time limit on the period during which requests to be heard will be accepted by the Committee.
Written statements, submitted by witnesses limited in their oral presentation, are printed in the hearing records, if of reasonable length and if received within a reasonable period after the hearings.
Other information directly pertaining to a hearing has also been printed in hearing records.
For example, during the 105th Congress, additional material was included in the printed record relating to NATO enlargement, and during the 106th Congress on the future of ABM.
Major hearings and many others are printed by the Committee.
However, it has become the practice of the Committee, for reasons of economy, not to print all hearings, especially on nominations.
In many cases, brief hearings or principal witness statements are printed in the appendix to the Committee's report on the measure under consideration; in all cases, the typed transcript of public proceedings is available to the public to read in the Committee offices.
Beginning in the fall of 1973, the Committee started a pioneering project of publishing its hitherto classified executive sessions dating from the 80th Congress in 1947, when pursuant to the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, verbatim records of committee meetings were ordered to be kept.
This so-called historical series has become a continuing activity, complementing the Department of State's collection of diplomatic papers in the Foreign Relations of the United States series with a record of congressional action and views.
Subcommittees    It is the tradition of the Committee on Foreign Relations to consider legislation, resolutions, treaties, and nominations in the full committee on the theory that most questions of foreign relations are not divisible by geographic or substantive matter.
A major exception was made in 1975 with the creation of the Subcommittee on Foreign Assistance, which was given jurisdiction over all legislation on foreign aid and international financial institutions.
In recent years, the Committee has returned to the practice of approving all legislation, treaties, and nominations on the full committee level.
Standing, temporary, or ad hoc, and oversight subcommittees have been utilized by the Committee at various times.
Subcommittees are appointed by majority vote of the Committee, unless otherwise authorized by law or Senate resolution.
Standing Subcommittees    From 1950 to 1975, the Committee on Foreign Relations maintained a series of consultative subcommittees, corresponding to the organization of the Department of State to a greater or lesser degree at various times.
The consultative subcommittee system was designed to foster more extensive consultations between the members of the Foreign Relations Committee and officers of the Department of State and to undertake independent studies in areas of special Committee interest.
Since World War II the U.S. role in the world thrust new and important responsibilities upon the Congress.
Moreover, the problems which confront the United States in various parts of the world increased tremendously in number and complexity.
This meant that a degree of specialization in the work of the Committee on Foreign Relations became desirable.
By organizing along subcommittee lines it was possible for the members to keep abreast of the more important developments within each of the geographic and substantive areas of concern in the conduct of foreign policy.
While the word ``consultative'' has been dropped from the subcommittee system, the role of the subcommittees in developing specialized information has continued much the same.
During the 106th Congress, the subcommittee structure was as follows:    (Subcommittees are listed in the order of chairmen's seniority within the full committee.)
(The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full committee are ex officio members of each subcommittee on which they do not serve as members.)

In the recent past the practice was to follow preferences of Committee members with respect to subcommittee assignments which resulted in varied sizes and differing ratios between majority and minority members.
However, beginning in the 95th Congress, ratios were set and minority members assumed different ``ranking'' positions on each subcommittee.
Except for the practice noted above, that legislation is considered by full committee, there is no rule as to whether a matter is considered by the full committee or a subcommittee.
Study or Oversight Subcommittees    In the past, when the Committee on Foreign Relations decided on a major oversight undertaking, requiring more staff and funds than available under its ordinary budget, the Committee has sought special authority and funds for the conduct of such studies.
The first such study authorized by the Senate after passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 was a study of overseas information programs of the United States in 1952 (S. Res.
74, 82d Cong.)
which ended in 1954.
This study set the pattern for most of the subsequent studies during the 1950's, namely, studies of the United Nations Charter (S. Res.
126, 1953), of the technical assistance program (S. Res.
214, 1954), of disarmament issues (S. Res.
93, 1955), of foreign assistance programs (S. Res.
285, 1956), and U.S. foreign policy (S. Res.
336, 1958).
A subcommittee was appointed to conduct the study or oversight and included non Committee members as well as Committee members.
The procedure generally was to collect and publish relevant documents; problem areas were explored in staff studies; questionnaires were sent to groups having special knowledge of the subject matter (American businessmen and reporters overseas, ambassadors, or retired Foreign Service Officers); on the spot surveys were made overseas, hearings were held on the accumulated data; and a final report was submitted to the Senate, giving the subcommittee's recommendations and conclusions.
Ad Hoc Subcommittees    For many years Ad hoc subcommittees were the only kind of subcommittees appointed by the Committee on Foreign Relations.
They were normally authorized to consider only one item or a related group of items, such as a series of double taxation conventions or broadcasting agreements.
As the Committee began more and more to consider treaties and legislation as a whole, the appointment of ad hoc subcommittees decreased.
No such subcommittees were appointed between 1959, when one was set up to consider certain broadcasting agreements, and 1965, when three ad hoc subcommittees were appointed to handle certain international organization matters, claims legislation, and double tax conventions.
In 1967 four additional ad hoc subcommittees were set up to consider customs and maritime matters, human rights conventions, deployment of U.S. troops in Europe, and a Foreign Service Information corps.
Since then, similar subcommittees have gone into passport matters, the International Grain Arrangement, the Genocide Convention, the International Wheat Agreement of 1971, and the operation of the War Powers Resolution.
Ad hoc subcommittees cease to exist the moment the matters referred to them are disposed of or upon adjournment of Congress.
Staff    The following provisions of the amended Standing Rules of the Senate are applicable to the Committee staff.
RULE XXVII                            committee staff          1.
Staff members appointed to assist minority members         of committees pursuant to authority of a resolution         described in paragraph 9 of rule XXVI or other Senate         resolution shall be accorded equitable treatment with         respect to the fixing of salary rates, the assignment         of facilities, and the accessibility of committee         records.
\10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \10\ See page 65, below, for paragraph 9 of rule XXVI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------          2.
The minority shall receive fair consideration in         the appointment of staff personnel pursuant to         authority of a resolution described in paragraph 9 of         rule XXVI.
3.
The staffs of committees (including personnel         appointed pursuant to authority of a resolution         described in paragraph 9 of rule XXVI or other Senate         resolution) should reflect the relative number of         majority and minority members of committees.
A majority         of the minority members of any committee may, by         resolution, request that at least one-third of all         funds of the committee for personnel (other than those         funds determined by the chairman and ranking minority         members to be allocated for the administrative and         clerical functions of the committee as a whole) to be         allocated to the minority members of such committee for         compensation of minority staff as the minority members         may decide.
The committee shall thereafter adjust its         budget to comply with such resolution.
Such adjustment         shall be equitably made over a four-year period,         commencing July 1, 1977, with not less than one-half         being made in two years.
Upon request by a majority of         the minority members of any committee by resolution,         proportionate space, equipment, and facilities shall be         provided for such minority staff.
4.
No committee shall appoint to its staff any         experts or other personnel detailed or assigned from         any department or agency of the Government, except with         the written permission of the Committee on Rules and         Administration.
As of September 29, 1999, the Committee's annual budget which provides funding for the exercise of its legislative oversight and for all staffing is included in S. Res.
189, the omnibus committee funding resolution.
From March 1 until September 30, 1999 temporary funding was authorized by S. Res.
49.
Portions of S. Res.
49 and S. Res.
189 are set forth on pages 66 and 68.
Prior to 1981, staff funding was included in the budget and also in separate resolutions.
For example, in 1958 the position of an interparliamentary assistant was authorized as visits of foreign dignitaries to Washington increased and as the Congress became more involved in interparliamentary activities.
This position was made permanent in 1962.
The size of the staff has increased over the years.
At the beginning of the 80th Congress, when the Committee began to organize its independent professional staff, it employed four persons; as of October 2000, 48 persons, professional and clerical, were employed on a permanent basis.
As a rule, the staff is assigned to the full committee, and subcommittees are not separately staffed.
Members of the full committee staff have the responsibility for taking care of the needs of subcommittees.
In accordance with the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended, members of the full committee staff were occasionally assigned to work primarily for the minority, but were also available for general committee assignments.
However, in January 1979 the minority members of the Committee elected to establish a minority staff as stipulated in Rule XXVII.2.
Since then, formal coordination of relations between the majority and minority staffs has been accomplished through the two staff directors, and various members of the staff performing administrative and clerical functions for the Committee have been considered as ``nondesignated.''
It should be noted that prior to the hiring of a minority staff in 1979, the Committee had appointed a personnel subcommittee in early 1958 which made recommendations to the full committee, and filled professional staff vacancies at the discretion of the Chairman as they developed.
This subcommittee consisted of the two ranking majority and minority members.
In the case of long-term special oversight studies, however, it has been occasionally necessary to augment the regular Committee staff with specialists for a limited period of time.
For shorter periods, consultants have been hired by the Committee, as in 1979 for consideration of the SALT II treaty, in 1981 for the nomination of Alexander M. Haig, Jr., to be Secretary of State, and in 1988 for consideration of the INF Treaty.
S. Res.
60 of the 94th Congress (June 12, 1975) authorized the hiring of additional persons by Committee members on their personal staff to assist them on Committee matters.
This resolution was superseded by the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1978, which contains provisions for the hiring of Personal Representatives of Members as follows:                       Public Law 95-94 [Excerpt]AN ACT Making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal          year ending September 30, 1978, and for other purposes          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of         Representatives of the United States of America in         Congress assembled, That the following sums are         appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not         otherwise appropriated, for the Legislative Branch for         the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and for         other purposes, namely:          * * * * * * *    Sec.

Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a committee from adopting policies and practices with respect to the application of this subsection which are similar to the policies and practices adopted with respect to the application of section 705(c)(1) of Senate Resolution 4, 95th Congress, and section 106(c)(1) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1977.
(3) A Senator shall notify the chairman and ranking minority member of a committee whenever a designation of an employee under this subsection with respect to such committee is terminated.

In accordance with a provision of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1965, the name, title, and total salary of each staff member is reported semiannually in the report of the Secretary of the Senate which is printed as a Senate document.
Finances    In accordance with Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate:    1.
Each standing committee, including any subcommittee of any such committee is authorized to hold such hearings, to sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by subpoena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, and documents, to take such testimony and to make such expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may be authorized by resolutions of the Senate.
Each such committee may make investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, may report such hearings as may be had by it, and may employ stenographic assistance at a cost not exceeding the amount prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration.
The expenses of the committee shall be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved by the chairman.
Rule XXVI.9 requires that each committee report a resolution authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses, including the compensation of members of its staff and agency contribution (i.e., retirement, life and health insurances) related to such compensation during a budget period beginning on March 1 of each year and ending on the last day of February of the following year:    Rule XXVI.9 reads as follows:    9.
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), each committee shall report one authorization resolution each year authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses, including the compensation of members of its staff and agency contributions related to such compensation, during the period beginning on March 1 of such year and ending on the last day of February of the following year.
Such annual authorization resolution shall be reported not later than January 31 of each year, except that, whenever the designation of members of standing committees of the Senate occurs during the first session of a Congress at a date later than January 20, such resolution may be reported at any time within thirty days after the date on which the designation of such members is completed.
After the annual authorization resolution of a committee for a year has been agreed to, such committee may procure authorization to make additional expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate during that year only by reporting a supplemental authorization resolution.
Each supplemental authorization resolution reported by a committee shall amend the annual authorization resolution of such committee for that year and shall be accompanied by a report specifying with particularity the purpose for which such authorization is sought and the reason why such authorization could not have been sought at the time of the submission by such committee of its annual authorization resolution for that year.
(b) In lieu of the procedure provided in subparagraph (a), the Committee on Rules and Administration may--          (1) direct each committee to report an authorization         resolution for a two-year budget period beginning on         March 1 of the first session of a Congress; and          (2) report one authorization resolution containing         more than one committee authorization resolution for a         one-year or two-year budget period.

The         information as to party affiliation here included is         from the Biographical Dictionary of the American         Congress, 1774-1927, and the various Congressional         Directories.
For the 28th to the 33d and the 35th and         36th Congresses the designations are those given in the         Congressional Globe.
Where a designation in the latter         has differed from that in the Biographical Dictionary,         preference has been given to the Congressional Globe.
Other authorities employed are the Dictionary of         American Biography, 1928-36, Appleton's Cyclopaedia of         American Biography, 1888-1918, and the National         Cyclopaedia of American Biography, 1893-1939.

An amendment to the rules of any such committee shall be published in the Congressional Record not later than thirty days after the adoption of such amendment.

Immediately upon the filing of the request, the clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the filing of the request.
If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the committee may file in the offices of the committee their written notice that a special meeting of the committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting.
The committee shall meet on that date and hour.
Immediately upon the filing of the notice the clerk of the committee shall notify all members of the committee that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.

4.

(b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) shall require each witness who is to appear before the committee in any hearing to file with the clerk of the committee, at least one day before the date of the appearance of that witness, a written statement of his proposed testimony unless the committee chairman and the ranking minority member determine that there is good cause for noncompliance.
If so requested by any committee, the staff of the committee shall prepare for the use of the members of the committee before each day of hearing before the committee a digest of the statements which have been so filed by witnesses who are to appear before the committee on that day.

(d) Whenever any hearing is conducted by a committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) upon any measure or matter, the minority on the committee shall be entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority members to the chairman before the completion of such hearing to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to the measure or matter during at least one day of hearing thereon.

(1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret         in the interests of national defense or the         confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the         United States;          
(2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff         personnel or internal staff management or procedure;          
(3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or         misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional         standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an         individual to public contempt or obloquy or will         represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy         of an individual;          
(4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law         enforcement agent or will disclose any information         relating to the investigation or prosecution of a         criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in         the interests of effective law enforcement;          
(5) will disclose information relating to the trade         secrets of financial or commercial information         pertaining specifically to a given person if--                  (A) an Act of Congress requires the                 information to be kept confidential by                 Government officers and employees; or                  (B) the information has been obtained by the                 Government on a confidential basis, other than                 through an application by such person for a                 specific Government financial or other benefit,                 and is required to be kept secret in order to                 prevent undue injury to the competitive                 position of such person; or          
(6) may divulge matters required to be kept         confidential under other provisions of law or         Government regulations.
(c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be broadcast by radio or television, or both, under rules as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.
(d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of order being made by a Senator.
When the Chair finds it necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.
(e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo such a record.

(a)(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, each committee, and each subcommittee thereof is authorized to fix the number of its members (but not less than one third of its entire membership) who shall constitute a quorum thereof for the transaction of such business as may be considered by said committee, except that no measure or matter or recommendation shall be reported from any committee unless a majority of the committee were physically present.
(2) Each such committee, or subcommittee, is authorized to fix a lesser number than one-third of its entire membership who shall constitute a quorum thereof for the purpose of taking sworn testimony.
(3) The vote of any committee to report a measure or matter shall require the concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee who are present.
No vote of any member of any committee to report a measure or matter may be cast by proxy if rules adopted by such committee forbid the casting of votes for that purpose by proxy; however, proxies may not be voted when the absent committee member has not been informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has not affirmatively requested that he be so recorded.
Action by any committee in reporting any measure or matter in accordance with the requirements of this subparagraph shall constitute the ratification by the committee of all action theretofore taken by the committee with respect to that measure or matter, including votes taken upon the measure or matter or any amendment thereto, and no point of order shall lie with respect to that measure or matter on the ground that such previous action with respect thereto by such committee was not taken in compliance with such requirements.
(b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) shall keep a complete record of all committee action.
Such record shall include a record of the votes on any question on which a record vote is demanded.
The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting of any committee upon any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee report on that measure unless previously announced by the committee, and such announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment by each member of the committee who was present at that meeting.
(c) Whenever any committee by roll call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the committee upon such measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes cast by each member of the committee in favor of and in opposition to such measure or matter.
Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall abrogate the power of any committee to adopt rules--          (1) providing for proxy voting on all matters other         than the reporting of a measure or matter, or          (2) providing in accordance with subparagraph (a) for         a lesser number as a quorum for any action other than         the reporting of a measure or matter.
8.
In order to assist the Senate in--          (1) its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of the         application, administration, and execution of the laws         enacted by the Congress, and          (2) its formulation, consideration, and enactment of         such modifications of or changes in those laws, and of         such additional legislation, as may be necessary or         appropriate,each standing committee (except the committees on Appropriations and the Budget), shall review and study, on a continuing basis the application, administration, and execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the legislative jurisdiction of that committee.
Such committees may carry out the required analysis, appraisal, and evaluation themselves, or by contract, or may require a Government agency to do so and furnish a report thereon to the Senate.
Such committees may rely on such techniques as pilot testing, analysis of costs in comparison with benefits, or provision for evaluation after a defined period of time.
(b) In each odd-numbered year, each such committee shall submit not later than March 31, to the Senate, a report on the activities of that committee under this paragraph during the Congress ending at noon on January 3 of such year.
9.
(a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), each committee shall report one authorization resolution each year authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses, including the compensation of members of its staff and agency contributions related to such compensation, during the period beginning on March 1 of such year and ending on the last day of February of the following year.
Such annual authorization resolution shall be reported not later than January 31 of each year, except that, whenever the designation of members of standing committees of the Senate occurs during the first session of a Congress at a date later than January 20, such resolution may be reported at any time within thirty days after the date on which the designation of such members is completed.
After the annual authorization resolution of a committee for a year has been agreed to, such committee may procure authorization to make additional expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate during that year only by reporting a supplemental authorization resolution.
Each supplemental authorization resolution reported by a committee shall amend the annual authorization resolution of such committee for that year and shall be accompanied by a report specifying with particularity the purpose for which such authorization is sought and the reason why such authorization could not have been sought at the time of the submission by such committee of its annual authorization resolution for that year.
(b) In lieu of the procedure provided in subparagraph (a), the Committee on Rules and Administration may--    (1) direct each committee to report an authorization     resolution for a two year budget period beginning on March     1 of the first session of a Congress; and    (2) report one authorization resolution containing more     than one committee authorization resolution for a one year     or two year budget period.
10.
(a) All committee hearings, records, data, charts, and files shall be kept separate and distinct from the congressional office records of the Member serving as chairman of the committee; and such records shall be the property of the Senate and all members of the committee and the Senate shall have access to such records.
Each committee is authorized to have printed and bound such testimony and other data presented at hearings held by the committee.
(b) It shall be the duty of the chairman of each committee to report or cause to be reported promptly to the Senate any measure approved by his committee and to take or cause to be taken necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote.
In any event, the report of any committee upon a measure which has been approved by the committee shall be filed within seven calendar days (exclusive of days on which the Senate is not in session) after the day on which there has been filed with the clerk of the committee a written and signed request of a majority of the committee for the reporting of that measure.
Upon the filing of any such request, the clerk of the committee shall transmit immediately to the chairman of the committee notice of the filing of that request.
This subparagraph does not apply to the Committee on Appropriations.
(c) If at the time of approval of a measure or matter by any committee (except for the Committee on Appropriations), any member of the committee gives notice of intention to file supplemental, minority, or additional views, that member shall be entitled to-not less than three calendar days in which to file such views, in writing, with the clerk of the committee.
All such views so filed by one or more members of the committee shall be included within, and shall be a part of, the report filed by the committee with respect to that measure or matter.
The report of the committee upon that measure or matter shall be printed in a single volume which--          (1) shall include all supplemental, minority, or         additional views which have been submitted by the time         of the filing of the report, and          (2) shall bear upon its cover a recital that         supplemental, minority, or additional views are         included as part of the report.
This subparagraph does not preclude--          (A) the immediate filing and printing of a committee         report unless timely request for the opportunity to         file supplemental, minority, or additional views has         been made as provided by this subparagraph; or          (B) the filing by any such committee of any         supplemental report upon any measure or matter which my         be required for the correction of any technical error         in a previous report made by that committee upon that         measure or matter.
11.
(a) The report accompanying each bill or joint resolution of a public character reported by any committee (except the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget) shall contain--          (1) an estimate, made by such committee, of the costs         which would be incurred in carrying out such bill or         joint resolution in the fiscal year in which it is         reported and in each of the five fiscal years following         such fiscal year (or for the authorized duration of any         program authorized by such bill or joint resolution, if         less than five years), except that, in the case of         measures affecting the revenue, such reports shall         require only an estimate of the gain or loss in         revenues for a one-year period; and          (2) a comparison of the estimate of costs described         in subparagraph (1) made by such committee with any         estimate of costs made by any Federal agency; or          (3) in lieu of such estimate or comparison, or both,         a statement of the reasons why compliance by the         committee with the requirements of subparagraph (1) or         (2), or both, is impracticable.
(b) each such report (except those by the Committee on Appropriations) shall also contain--          (1) an evaluation, made by such committee, of the         regulatory impact which would be incurred in carrying         out the bill or joint resolution.
The evaluation shall         include (A) an estimate of the numbers of individuals         and businesses who would be regulated and a         determination of the groups and classes of such         individuals and businesses, (B) a determination of the         economic impact of such regulation on the individuals,         consumers, and businesses affected, (C) a determination         of the impact of the personal privacy of the         individuals affected, and (D) a determination of the         amount of additional paperwork that will result from         the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill         or joint resolution, which determination may include,         but need not be limited to, estimates of the amount of         time and financial costs required of affected parties,         showing whether the effects of the bill or joint         resolution could be substantial, as well as reasonable         estimates of the recordkeeping requirements that may be         associated with the bill or joint resolution; or          (2) in lieu of such evaluation, a statement of the         reasons why compliance by the committee with the         requirements of clause (1) is impracticable.
(c) It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider any such bill or joint resolution if the report of the committee on such bill or joint resolution does not comply with the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) on the objection of any Senator.
12.
Whenever a committee reports a bill or a joint resolution repealing or amending any statute or part thereof it shall make a report thereon and shall include in such report or in an accompanying document (to be prepared by the staff of such committee) (a) the text of the statute or part thereof which is proposed to be repealed; and (b) a comparative print of that part of the bill or joint resolution making the amendment and of the statute or part thereof proposed to be amended, showing by stricken through type and italics, parallel columns, or other appropriate typographical devices the omissions and insertions which would be made by the bill or joint resolution if enacted in the form recommended by the committee.
This paragraph shall not apply to any such report in which it is stated that, in the opinion of the committee, it is necessary to dispense with the requirement of this subsection to expedite the business of the Senate--    13.
(a) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) which has legislative jurisdiction shall, in its consideration of all bills and joint resolutions of a public character within its jurisdiction, endeavor to insure that--          (1) all continuing programs of the Federal Government         and of the government of the District of Columbia,         within the jurisdiction of such committee or joint         committee, are designed; and          (2) all continuing activities of Federal agencies,         within the jurisdiction of such committee or joint         committee, are carried on;so that, to the extent consistent with the nature, requirements, and objectives of those programs and activities, appropriations therefor will be made annually.
(b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) shall with respect to any continuing program within its jurisdiction for which appropriations are not made annually, review such program, from time to time, in order to ascertain whether such program could be modified so that appropriations therefor would be made annually.
