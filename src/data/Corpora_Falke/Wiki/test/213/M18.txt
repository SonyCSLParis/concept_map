Bookends: Two September Days of Terror That Framed the American Century
Almost exactly one hundred years prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, another act of terror on a bright September day in New York rocked the United States during the first year of a new century.
In the photo above, President William Mc
Kinley is shown walking up the steps at the Temple of Music at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York just minutes before he was shot.
McKinley had recently been re-elected to a second term and was extraordinarily popular after successfully leading the country through the Spanish-American War.
At the Pan-American Exposition, President Mc
Kinley spent time attending receptions, meeting dignitaries, and shaking hands with visitors to the fair.
It was work Mc
Kinley enjoyed doing.
The 58-year-old President was a kindly, gentle man who doted over his beloved wife who was nearly invalid.
Ida Mc
Kinley was epileptic and the President took care of her constantly, never shying away from her illness or allowing it to affect his responsibilities or his public duties.
At dinners, if Ida suffered an epileptic fit or seizure, the President would quietly and gently drape a handkerchief over her face or distract everyone’s attention and continue conversation as usual.
McKinley thoughtfully included Ida in as much as she could handle and never made her feel embarrassed about her condition.
McKinley was kind to other people, as well.
The President hated to disappoint people, hated to tell people no, and hated to be the person to break bad news to someone else.
Often, Mc
Kinley would wear a pink carnation in his lapel, which he would give to those who might be disappointed after a difficult meeting.
President Mc
Kinley wanted people who met with him to at least walk away with something when they left his office, even if they didn’t get what they had come for.
It was this thoughtfulness which led William Mc
Kinley to deflect worries by his personal secretary George B. Cortelyou that the public receptions at the Pan-American Exposition might be a security risk.
It was Mc
Kinley’s gentle manner which led him to refuse Cortelyou’s suggestions to cancel the public receptions in Buffalo.
It was Mc
Kinley’s good heart which led him to genuinely believe that “No one would wish to hurt me.
"  It was the way that Mc
Kinley put other people first that caused him to notice the man in line at the Temple of Music with a bandaged right hand and decide to reach to shake the man’s other hand.
The man with the bandaged hand was Leon Czolgosz, a 28-year-old unemployed mill worker originally from Detroit.
The son of Polish immigrants, Czolgosz had become interested in anarchism and after witnessing a speech by famed anarchist Emma Goldman, Czolgosz decided to make a statement by killing the President.
A day earlier, Czogolsz had planned to shoot Mc
Kinley as the President gave his President’s Day speech at the Exposition, but the assassin could not get close enough.
On September 6th, Czoglosz got as close as one could be to the President of the United States and took advantage of William Mc
Kinley’s kindness.
As the line queued in the Temple of Music, President Mc
Kinley shook hands while surrounded by his personal secretary, Cortelyou, the Exposition’s administrator, John Milburn, and a Secret Service agent.
The Secret Service was not normally charged with the protection of Presidents in 1901, but on this day, two agents accompanied President Mc
Kinley as he greeted the large crowd of well-wishers in Buffalo.
The photo above shows the inside of the Temple of Music and an "x” marks the spot where President Mc
Kinley stood to shake hands with Leon Czolgosz at 4:07 PM on September 6, 1901.
When the President noticed the bandage on Czolgosz’s right hand, Mc
Kinley quickly changed hands to shake Czolgosz’s uninjured left hand.
As the two men grasped hands, Czogolsz grabbed Mc
Kinley and pulled him close.
Underneath the bandage in Czogolsz’s right hand was a .32 Iver Johnson revolver and he quickly shot President Mc
Kinley twice, point-blank.
The first bullet struck a button and grazed the President’s breastbone without penetrating the skin.
The second shot that Czolgosz fired was far more dangerous.
At point-blank range, so close that it left powder burns on Mc
Kinley’s abdomen, the second bullet passed through the President’s stomach, clipped the top of his left kidney and lodged deep in Mc
Kinley’s pancreas.
Still standing for a moment after the shooting, Mc
Kinley fell backwards into the arms of one of the Secret Service agents and his secretary, George Cortelyou.
Czolgosz – his bandage in flames due to the gunshots – was quickly grabbed by the person in line behind him, James Parker.
Parker, a 6'5" black man, punched the assassin and knocked him to the ground.
The Secret Service agents later admitted that they hadn’t noticed Czolgosz’s suspicious bandaged hand because they were closely watching the large black man, Parker, who was directly behind the assassin.
Buffalo policemen and some fair-goers jumped on Czolgosz and began beating him.
When the seriously wounded President saw this, Mc
Kinley yelled, “Don’t let them hurt him!”
.
Lying on the floor of the Pan-American Exposition’s Temple of Music, President Mc
Kinley thought of his ailing wife.
To his loyal secretary, the President pleaded, “My wife, be careful, Cortelyou, how you tell her – oh, be careful."
McKinley was rushed to a hospital on the fairgrounds.
At first, it appeared as if Mc
Kinley would survive.
In modern terms, Mc
Kinley’s gunshot wounds were far less dangerous than those suffered by Ronald Reagan in 1981.
Had Mc
Kinley received the same level of care and expertise that President Reagan did eighty years later, he likely would have survived.
However, the doctors in Buffalo searched in vain for the bullet that lodged in his pancreas and left behind bacteria which caused an infection.
After rallying within the first few days of the shooting, Mc
Kinley’s condition rapidly deteriorated.
On September 11, 1901, there was hope as Mc
Kinley ate solid food for the first time since the shooting.
Sadly, within 24 hours, hope had dissipated.
In the home of the Exposition’s president John Milburn on the morning of September 14, 1901, a quiet crowd surrounded the outside of the building while on the inside, a vigil mounted by his friends, doctors, and colleagues watched over the dying President.
At 2:15 AM on September 14th, President William Mc
Kinley died.
What really killed Mc
Kinley – besides Czologsz’s act of terror – was a gangrenous infection.
Ironically, President Mc
Kinley could have been saved by an X-Ray machine and at the Pan-American Exposition that day there was an experimental X-Ray machine on display.
Nobody thought to retrieve it.
Czolgosz quickly confessed to the assassination, stating "I killed President Mc
Kinley because I done my duty.
I didn’t believe one man should have so much service and another man should have none."
Less than a month-and-a-half later, Czolgosz was executed in the electric chamber of New York’s Auburn State Prison
Much like what the United States would experience exactly one hundred years later in the days following the September 11th terrorist attacks, a stunned nation had an outpouring of grief after President Mc
Kinley’s assassination.
Americans could hardly believe that such a beautiful September day in New York could turn so ugly, especially as everyone celebrated the first year of a new century.
The flag was everywhere and red, white and blue was displayed along with black crepe mourning the tragedy.
As with what would happen again 100 years later, the people were united in their sorrow, buried their victim, and looked to a future full of new battles.
In 1901, as in 2001, the United States faced a new day of challenges when an act of terror robbed the country of some of its innocence on a beautiful September day in New York.
