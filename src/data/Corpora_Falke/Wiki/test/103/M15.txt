Bildunterschrift:Angkor Wat was first a Hindu, then subsequently a Buddhist, temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world.
The temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century.
As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious center since its foundation.
Angkor Wat lies 5.5 kilometres (3.4 mi) north of the modern town of Siem Reap.
It is in an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures.
