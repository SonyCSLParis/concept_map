Blood in the House of Commons!
Two hundred years on, the shocking story of Spencer Perceval, the only British PM to have been assassinated
By MILES GOSLETTPUBLISHED: 13:54 GMT, 1 May 2012 | UPDATED: 06:33 GMT, 2 May 2012
At around 5 o'clock on the afternoon of May 11 1812 the Tory Prime Minister Spencer Perceval walked into the lobby of the Palace of Westminster for what would be the last time.
His family – he had six sons and six daughters with his wife, Jane – had begged him not to go to Parliament that day.
Perhaps they had had some premonition of the horror to come.
But Perceval, a conscientious, deeply honourable man, felt that he had a duty to attend a debate being held in the House of Commons into the conduct of the government.
As he entered the lobby on his way to the chamber, his colleague Lord Osborne walking a few steps behind him, a man who had been sitting quietly next to a fireplace nearby suddenly stood up and approached Perceval.
When he neared him, the man reached into a pocket of his overcoat and whipped out a pistol.
Before the startled Perceval had time to react, the man had shot him through the heart at point-blank range.
According to eyewitness accounts Perceval, a tiny man of five feet four inches, lurched forward a few steps, uttering ‘Murder’ or ‘I am murdered’ in a barely audible gasp.
He then fell flat on his face at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich, who had been speaking to a colleague nearby.
Smith later admitted that he did not recognise Perceval until he knelt down to help him.
As the stricken prime minister lay there, a few convulsive sobs escaping from his mouth, blood seeped through his clothing and on to the floor.
Seeing how seriously Perceval was hurt, Smith and another man picked him up and carried him to the Speaker’s apartments.
Smith recalled at the inquest into Perceval's death: ‘We set him on a table, he resting on our arms.
I think he was not only speechless, but perfectly senseless, and blood came from his mouth.
His pulse in a few minutes ceased and he soon died.’
Someone had sent for a surgeon, Mr Lynn of neighbouring Great George Street, but by the time he arrived it was too late.
It is highly unlikely he could have done anything for Perceval in any case.
The musket ball was so large it had passed completely through Perceval’s heart, making him the only premier in British history to be assassinated in office.
Downstairs in the lobby, meanwhile, about 30 or 40 people had gathered at the scene having heard the pistol’s report.
All of Parliament’s doors had been locked to prevent the gunman escaping.
But there was no need.
The assassin, having discharged his shot, had walked calmly back to the fireplace and sat down again.
As the contemporary journalist Edward Baines noted: ‘When a spectator at last exclaimed “Where is the villain who fired?”
a person, who had remained unobserved, stepped forward, and coolly said “I am the unfortunate man.
”’ He was seized and his pistol was taken.
Another pistol was also found on him, primed and loaded, presumably in case the first had misfired.
Now the assassin’s coolness appeared to desert him.
As a small crowd surrounded him he began sweating profusely and appeared to have difficulty breathing.
Some in the crowd recognized him.
Was he not the man who had been in the gallery some weeks before, asking the identities of various ministers as they spoke?
Had he not been hanging around the lobby accosting ministers as they walked through, slinking away disappointed when they brushed off his entreaties?
He was soon identified as John Bellingham, a bankrupt businessman who bore a deep grudge against the government which, he felt, had betrayed him.
With that single shot he plunged Britain into shock, turned Perceval’s wife into a widow, and left his twelve children without a father.
Amazingly, however, for an institution which prides itself on tradition and in so many respects keeps history alive, four patterned floor tiles at the place where Perceval fell are the sole commemoration to his killing within the Palace of Westminster, identifiable only because they face in the opposite direction to the rest of the tiling in that part of the Commons.
Apart from these obscure markings there is not so much as a discreet plaque there to inform people of this momentous event, let alone a statue of the diminutive Perceval, earning him the nickname 'the forgotten Prime Minister'.
Now, as the 200th anniversary of his death approaches, it has come to light that today’s Westminster authorities are no keener than their predecessors to pay a meaningful tribute to the only British leader of modern times who has made the ultimate sacrifice.
A group of parliamentarians - including, poignantly, the assassin's ancestor, Henry Bellingham, a Tory MP - have been forced to organise their own special ceremony for Perceval this month after learning that official plans to remember him on May 11 centre around updating the parliamentary Twitter feed and posting some new pages on the parliamentary website.
Crossbench peer Lord Laird of Artigarvan, who is finalising the details of a more meaningful event for Perceval, has dismissed parliament’s electronic offerings as 'completely inappropriate'.
Lord Laird told the Mail: 'A group of us believe that this anniversary calls for a little more than a Twitter feed.
We're proposing to hold a ceremony at midday on May 11 so we can lay a wreath at the place where Spencer Perceval was shot.
We're going to mark his death in the appropriate way.
Perceval was the only prime minister to be assassinated in office.
He died serving his country.
It's a very poor show to remember him by a few floor tiles and the very ephemeral medium of Twitter.
Longer term, I would like to see a plaque or statue for Perceval.'
Henry Bellingham supports Laird’s desire to honour the man whom his own relative murdered, saying: ‘John Bellingham didn’t have children but we share a common ancestor so I feel strongly about this and the point that Lord Laird makes is a good one.
Spencer Perceval was cut down in his prime.
It’s pretty shabby not to have anything more substantial to commemorate his premiership and two hundred years on seems a good time to correct this.
On May 11 I intend to be at the ceremony.
It’s a time for the Percevals to forgive the Bellinghams and to make sure that Spencer Perceval is properly recognised.’
Ironically, Henry Bellingham is now a minister for the Foreign Office, the very government department whose callous treatment of John Bellingham provoked him to commit murder.
At his trial at the Old Bailey just a few days after the crime, 35-year-old Bellingham revealed that he had harboured a grievance against the British government because, while working in the city of Archangel in Russia, in 1804 he was imprisoned for around four years as a result of his involvement in a shipping dispute.
The British ambassador in Russia, Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, failed to come to his aid, although the charges were almost certainly trumped up.
Bellingham was a British subject, falsely imprisoned, his life in danger.
Yet the British embassy ignored his plight, leaving him to rot for nearly six years in a rat-infested cell, surviving on bread and water.
Unsurprisingly, when he was finally released in 1809, Bellingham was imbued with bitterness against the Foreign Office, and the government as a whole, who had abandoned him to his fate.
During his time in prison his business had collapsed and he became bankrupt.
For more than two years he petitioned the Foreign Office, demanding financial compensation from the government for failing to support or repatriate him.
But his pleas were ignored or rejected .
In desperation he visited the House of Commons and hung about the lobby where he would accost MPs and ask for their help, but few bothered to listen to him, let alone help him.
He is thought to have approached Spencer Perceval several times but Perceval, a busy man, did not stop to listen to him.
Snubbed, frustrated, desperate and obsessed at what he saw as his betrayal by the highest in the land, Bellingham began to harbour thoughts of revenge.
In March 1812 he told police magistrates that, if he was again refused help by the government, he would 'feel justified in executing justice myself'.
They ignored him.
After petitioning the Foreign Office for a final time in April 1812, Bellingham began to plot Perceval’s murder.
He acquired the pair of pistols and asked a London tailor to make a secret nine inch-deep pocket in his overcoat where he could conceal them.
Then he went to Parliament and lay in wait.
Straight after the murder Bellingham was arrested and held in the parliament prison cell.
Within a few hours he was transferred to Newgate Prison.
His trial, on May 15, was a swift affair.
The jury took just over ten minutes to find him guilty.
He was sentenced to death by hanging, and executed publicly in London on May 18, only a week after the crime.
While Perceval’s family had seen justice done, his death left them almost destitute.
Although Perceval was the younger son of the Earl of Egmont he had not been a wealthy man.
On his death it was discovered that the 49-year-old had only £106 5s 1d in the bank, so parliament voted to award his 12 surviving children, a grant of £50,000 and an annual sum of £2,000 to his widow.
His eldest son, also called Spencer, was given £1,000 yearly.
Perceval’s official title was First Lord of the Treasury – the title of Prime Minister was not then in use – and although not an outstanding premier, he was a competent, decent man who had steered the country through the upheaval of the Napoleonic Wars abroad and social instability at home brought on by the Industrial Revolution.
After his murder public monuments to him were erected in Northampton, his parliamentary seat; at Lincoln’s Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1786; and in Westminster Abbey.
His friends – among them William Wilberforce, the anti-slavery campaigner – wanted to erect a monument to him in the House of Commons, but some members of the Whig party opposed it and in the end nothing was done.
According to Henry Bellingham: ‘He deserves better.
He has gone down in history as the man who never had the chance to prove his great potential.
We hope there will be a way of securing funding for a statue or plaque and advancing this cause.’
Surely, Henry Bellingham argues, even Perceval's detractors would admit that he should be more than just a footnote in history, and is deserving of a proper acknowledgement at Westminster on the anniversary of his assassination?
Mr Bellingham said: ‘Perceval hadn’t really had time to get going but he wasn‘t a bad prime minister.
It’s odd, it’s a big oversight not to have any formal commemoration to him.
There may have been something in the old House of Commons before 1834 when the big fire took place but this should be addressed soon.
It’s completely inadequate not to have some sort of memorial to him.'
As well as updating its Twitter feed and website on May 11, the Parliamentary Archives, which is in charge of the Perceval commemoration for both Houses, will mark the assassination with a display of records and artwork in the Royal Gallery between May and mid-August.
And on the anniversary itself there will also be a lunchtime talk by the Clerk of the Records.
But Lord Laird and the rest of his cross-party group says it is important to dignify Perceval with a proper, personal ceremony on May 11 and he would like to hear from anyone who believes they might be related to Perceval so that they can attend it.
Lord Laird said: 'I'm appealing to anyone who thinks they are a descendant of Spencer Perceval to contact me at the House of Lords.
Bellingham's relation will be there.
It would be a very nice touch if some of Perceval's relatives could come too.
It's a great pity that parliament has failed to understand the full significance of this.
Perceval paid the greatest price for being prime minister.
We will seek permission to start at St Stephen's Entrance and walk up to the tiles and lay flowers where Perceval fell.
As for the future, we believe he should be remembered more permanently.'
