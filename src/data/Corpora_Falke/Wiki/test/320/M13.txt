Edward VIII abdicates
Edward VIII’s abdication as King of the United Kingdom becomes effective on this day in 1936.
He was the first English monarch to voluntarily abdicate the throne.
The eldest son of King George V, he ruled for less than one year.
An abdication crisis arose as Edward VIII was intent on marrying Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who was twice-divorced.
Because of her past failed marriages Simpson was perceived to be unsuitable as a consort.
Despite opposition from the royal family, the British government and the Church of England, of which Edward VIII was the nominal head, the monarch remained adamant.
Their affair was kept secret for several years, but then openly discussed in Parliament at the beginning of December, after news of it broke on the front pages of British newspapers.
With no resolution in sight, Edward renounced the throne.
In his abdication speech, he said: “I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love”.
The following day his younger brother Albert, who took the regnal name of George VI, was proclaimed king.
He is the father of the reigning British monarch, Elizabeth II.
Edward married Simpson in June of the following year and remained married until his death, 35 years later.
As the capital of the then British Empire, London was center stage for this plot.
