To 1912
Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic, and has produced significant archaeological finds.
Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards.
The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the very cold conditions that existed then, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present.
As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea.
This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.

long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell Marsh date from a time when it was 60 â€“ 70km from the sea.
Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000â€“10,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000â€“2,500 BCE).
An "eye" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings.
Blakeney's former Carmelite friary, founded in 1296 and dissolved in 1538, was built in such a location,Robertson et al. (2005) p. 36.
and several fragments of plain roof tile and pantiles dating back to the 13th century have been found near the site of its ruins.Robertson et al. (2005) p. 143.
Originally on the south side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as "Blakeney Chapel", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century.
Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function.
Nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,Birks (2003) pp. 1â€“28.

The spit sheltered the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, which were important medieval harbours.
Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials.
Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church.
It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, Retrieved 10 September 2011.
perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.
Land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf.
Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley.
In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost.Pevsner & Wilson (2002) p. 435.
The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply.Hume, Joseph.
"Port of Cley and Blakeney" in appendix to Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access.
Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.
National Trust era300pxfrom Wikipedia by Jimfbleak /by-sa/3.0In the decades preceding World War I, this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling; locals were looking for food, but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds; Norfolk's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884.
In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its "Watcher", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.
In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit.
When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development.
In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust.
UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point.
The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre.
Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.
The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986.
The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
The Point became a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 1994, and the coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with Scolt Head Island, became a Biosphere Reserve in 1976.
