Long Read: The Cottingley Fairies – A Weird British Story of Myth and Hype With a Connection to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
July 22, 2014 By Derek 2 Comments
My Dad and I are fans of Sherlock Holmes.
We both eagerly await Series 4 of Sherlock, and my Dad once embedded the following words from Arthur Conan Doyle in all his emails: “Whenever you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
This column is not so much about him as how Arthur Conan Doyle managed to completely disregard his own advice and start believing in fairies.
How it came to pass
By all accounts, it all started as harmless fun.
in the summer of 1917, 9-year-old Frances Griffith and her mother left their home in South Africa to go to  the home of her 16-year-old cousin Elsie Wright and her mother in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
Despite the age difference, the two got along swimmingly, even spending their days playing near the stream.
When their mothers noticed how wet their clothes got, they made the excuse that they were only out there playing with fairies.
Arthur Wright, Elsie’s father was an amateur photographer back in the days before anyone with a cell phone could take a photo of anything on the fly, or, indeed, before anyone with access to a supermarket could drop their film off and get fully developed photos in about an hour.
So, to prove their claims, they convinced him to lend them his camera so they could show it.
30 minutes later, they came back with the first in what would become a series of 5 photos.
However, he dismissed them as cardboard cutouts.
Remember this: this will be important later.
Two months later, they decided to give it another try and came up with another photograph.
This time, Dad was convinced the girls had tampered with his camera and refused to allow them to use it again.
Mom, however, was convinced.
Two years after the photos were taken, Mom attended a meeting of Bradford’s Theosophical Society on fairies and showed the two photographs to the speaker near the end of the meeting.
Later, they would be shown at a meeting of the Theosophical Society, and Edward Gardner, a leading member, said of the photographs that: “the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies, which others had done, but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate, meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway.”
For the record, the Theosophical Society really assumed evolution worked that way.
Then, they sent the photographs and the original glass plates to an expert who insisted that “the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs … [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models” and that “these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time.”
Eventually, in 1920, Arthur Conan Doyle found out about these photographs.
Enter Arthur Conan Doyle.
This is going to need some explanation: why did the man who wrote “Whenever you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth” fall for this?
Simply put, a few years before, he went through the wringer.
In 1918, his son Kingsley died of pneumonia while recovering from injuries incurred two years earlier in the Battle of the Somme.
The next year, his brother Innes died of pneumonia.
Like many, he found succor in the belief in life after death, and found himself getting more and more involved in Spiritualist movements.
As anyone who’s read Joan Didion knows, such a loss can easily affect one’s thought processes, and in Arthur Conan Doyle, it reached the point that he was convinced that his good friend Harry Houdini (who went through similar experiences and ended up having the exact opposite reaction to the supernatural) really had supernatural powers, despite both his demonstrations and remonstrations to the contrary.
One is reminded of the scene from Blackadder the Third where Edmund complains that the Prince Regent loves the theatre but doesn’t seem to understand it’s not real.
So, if he was able to convince himself that a magician who spent the later part of his life debunking the supernatural was himself supernatural, it’s not too hard to see why he was convinced the photos were real.
He was working on an article on fairies for a Christmas edition of the Strand, and asked the Wrights for permission to use the photographs.
Needless to say, Arthur Wright was so impressed that the man who created Sherlock Holmes was asking him for the rights that he let him print them free of charge.
Doyle found another expert at Kodak to examine the photographs and, while hesitant to admit they were evidence of fairies, insisted there was no doctoring of the photographs.
Another company said there was “some evidence of faking”, and a scientist examined the photos and insisted that the fairies were dancers with “distinctly ‘Parisienne‘” hairstyles.
But Doyle was convinced.
Three more photos.
In Summer 1920, Doyle was on a lecture tour of Australia, so he couldn’t just go to the other side of the world.
But Edward Gardner decided to go to the Wright house.
Arthur told Gardner that when the two were away, he searched both their rooms and the beck where the photos were taken and found no evidence of fraud.
He convinced Frances, who had moved to Scarborough, to return so they could take new photographs of the local fairies.
In his words: “I went off, to Cottingley again, taking the two cameras and plates from London, and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras, giving one each to keep.
The cameras were loaded, and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and tice the fairies, as they called their way of attracting them, and see what they could get.
I suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance, for I knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility.
If nothing came of it all, I told them, they were not to mind a bit.”
It wasn’t until August 19 that they decided the weather was right for photography.
Frances and Elsie told everyone that the fairies would reveal themselves to them alone.
They each took one photograph while Mother went to her sister’s for tea.
Two days later, they took a photo, apparently of fairies in their nest, and that was the end of it.
They sent the photos to Doyle, who promptly worked them into a book called The Coming of the Fairies.
The Publication
Doyle published the original 1917 photos in an article in the Strand, writing a sympathetic account of Frances and Elsie’s encounters, calling them Alice and Iris Carpenter to protect their identities, ending with the words: “The recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud, and will make it admit that there is a glamour and mystery to life.
Having discovered this, the world will not find it so difficult to accept that spiritual message supported by physical facts which has already been put before it.”
Reactions ranged from Major John Hall-Edwards, photographer and early advocate of X-rays “On the evidence I have no hesitation in saying that these photographs could have been “faked”.
I criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because, as a medical man, I believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the minds of children will result in later life in manifestations and nervous disorder and mental disturbances,” to novelist Henry de Vere Stacpoole saying “Look at Alice’s [Frances’] face.
Look at Iris’s [Elsie’s] face.
There is an extraordinary thing called TRUTH which has 10 million faces and forms – it is God’s currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can’t imitate it.”
Unfortunately, by the time Doyle’s book came out, interest had largely subsided.
The Resurrection of the Fairies
The next summer, Gardner had one more visit with Frances and Elsie, this time bringing noted clairvoyant Geoffrey Hodson.
They came to hunt for fairies, but Frances and Elsie claimed they didn’t see any.
But Hodson saw fairies everywhere.
In a film about the fairies, this would probably be a perfect ending.
The two girls, having put aside childish things like fairies, decide to stop playing the game, but the adults, in their second childhood, are convinced that they’re everywhere.
But the story didn’t end there.
45 years later, a reporter for the Daily Express tracked down Elsie, who claimed this time that the fairies were figments of her imagination, but suggested that she was somehow able to photograph the contents of her mind, sparking a new interest in the photographs.
In 1976, they were both on Yorkshire Television, where they simultaneously claimed that “a rational person doesn’t see fairies,” and that the photos were genuine.
More analysis of the photos was done and it leaned more heavily towards “fake” than they did earlier.
Indeed, skeptic extraordinaire James Randi noticed he could even see strings on the fairies.
But this doesn’t end there.
How it happened
In 1983, the cousins finally admitted that the photographs were a hoax.
They still insisted they really saw fairies, but they explained that the fairies in the photographs were all traced from illustrations of fairies from Princess Mary’s Gift Book, a children’s anthology popular at the time.
They cut them out, painted them, supported them with hatpins, and threw them in the beck when they were done.
However, the fifth photograph remained controversial; Elsie admitted it was a fake, but Frances maintained that it was genuine.
Elsie said in a 1985 interview with Yorkshire Television: “Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well, we could only keep quiet.
I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can’t understand to this day why they were taken in – they wanted to be taken in.”
They both died in the 1980s.
The Afterlife of the Fairies.
By 1988, both cousins were dead.
The photographs, two of the cameras used to make them, Elsie’s watercolours of the fairies, and a 9-page letter of Elsie admitting to the hoax are currently on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford.
Christine Lynch, Frances’ daughter, had one of Frances’ cameras and her copies of the photographs appraised, and got a price of £25,000 and £30,000.
A few months later, Frances’ memoirs, Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies were published, containing increasingly bitter correspondence between Frances and Elsie from 1917 to 1983.
In 1994, Brian Froud and Terry Jones wrote a book called Lady Cottington’s Pressed Fairy Book parodying the phoenomenon, and in 1997, two films were made about the hoax, Fairy
Tale: A True Story, and Photographing Fairies.
Both are very loosely based on the real events, the former taking Frances and Elsie at their word, that the photographs may have been fake, but the fairies themselves were real, and the latter changing everyone’s names and getting so dark that it ends with a murder.
It’s difficult to tell which takes greater liberties with the original story.
The moral of the story:“Whenever you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,” but try to examine what exactly you mean by “impossible” whenever possible.
