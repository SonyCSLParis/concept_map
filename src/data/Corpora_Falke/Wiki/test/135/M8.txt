TranscriptsLetter One
Dear Miss Elsie WrightI have seen the wonderful pictures of the fairies which you and your cousin Frances have taken, and I have not been so interested for a long time.
I will send you tomorrow one of my little books for I am sure you are not too old to enjoy adventures.
I am going to Australia soon, but I only wish before I go that I could get to Bradford and have half an hours chat with you, for I should like to hear all about it.
With best wishes
Yours sincerely
Arthur Conan Doyle
Mr Gardner told me about it.
Letter Two
Dear Mr. Wright I have seen the very interesting photos which your little girl took.
They are certainly amazing.
I was writing a little article for the Strand upon the evidence for the existence of fairies, so that I was very much interested.
I should naturally like to use the photos, along with other material, in my article but would not of course do so without your knowledge and permission.
It would be in the Xmas number.
I suggest1.
That no name be mentioned, so that neither you nor your daughter be annoyed in any way.
2.
That the use be reserved for the Strand only until Xmas.
After that it reverts of course to you.
3.
That either £5 be paid to you by the Strand for the temporary use, or that if you don't care to take money, you be put on the free list of the magazine for five years.
The articles appear in America in connection with the Strand publication.
I would, if you agree, try to get you another £5 from that side.
If this is all agreeable to you I or my friend Mr Gardner would try to run up & have half an hours chat with the girls
Yours sincerelyA Conan Doyle
