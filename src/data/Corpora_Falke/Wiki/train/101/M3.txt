7 World Trade Center
7 World Trade Center was a building in New York City that was destroyed on 9/11.
Although it is rarely talked about in the mainstream media, it has become the central focus of conspiracy theories surrounding the events of that day; as many qualified and credible architects, engineers and physics professors such as Charlie Sheen and Rosie O'Donnell believe the building was intentionally demolished.
