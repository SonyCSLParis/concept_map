1. INTRODUCTION The basic language understanding technology in the Paramax language understanding architecture has been designed to be both independent of the language input inodality (e.g. spoken input vs. scanned OCR input) as we]] as independent of the end application (e.g. command and control vs. data extraction). This architecture is shown in Figure 1.

2. SPOKEN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING
The focus of our spoken language understanding work is the development of a domainand applicationindependent dialog processing architecture which can be coupled

with a variety of speech recognizers. Some of our recent achievements include:
• a non-monotonic reasoning capability, which will support "what if?" exploratory dialogs
• a query paraphrase component to enhance userfriendliness
• enhanced reference resolution capabilities to support additional types of context-dependent references
• automated training techniques for semantics
Figure 2 illustrates the integration of a speech recognizer, language understanding component, and a dialog manager (VFE) into a modular spoken language architecture interacting with the user and the application. A

3. TEXT UNDERSTANDING In text understanding we emphasize an architecture in which a variety of components cooperate to produce an analysis of texts. Not all components may be required for any one particular application - they can be intermixed in various ways to suit each application's needs. This architecture, shown in Figure 3 includes keyword-based information retrieval, for message routing. A knowledge-based information retrieval component (KBIRD) extracts text information which is accessable without a detailed natural language analysis. If an application requires detailed natural language processing, a natural language processing system is available. Finally, a database record generator formats the extracted information for database generation. This approach is described in [2].

4. DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING
The object of Paramax document understanding research is to develop novel knowledge-based approaches to the processing of document images. Starting with the scanned image(s) of a document's pages, our goal is to determine the document's functional and physical organization and to extract the key ideas from the ASCII representation of its text. Our current focus is on producing the structural interpretation of the document and the accompanying ASCII text for each component. The ASCII text would then be analyzed by a text-understanding system, as discussed in Section 2.
An intelligent document understanding system is shown in Figure 4 with the scope of our project falling in the shaded region.
This work is discussed in detail in [3].
