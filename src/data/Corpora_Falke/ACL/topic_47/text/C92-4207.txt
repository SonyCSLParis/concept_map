Given ~ text, SPR INT makes a sm'faee ease structure using the lexical information. Each ent ity is described ms a noltlt. Next, SPR INT extracts spatial constraints about the entit ies by analyzing the related words in the case. structure. At this time. SPR INT also extracts the sequence of the information references fl'om the lexical mtbrmation as dependencies, which are used as cues in the calculation of the paranwters.
At the next stage, the extracted qual i tat ive constraints are intertn'eted as the nmnerical constraints among the e,ltity paranletc.rs. These nul l lerical COllstrailltS :4re repl 'esented }kS the COlllbinatiolt of the primit ive constraints. Tit(! tmten - tial energy function is one of such primitives, and this is an efficient method to treat the vagllelteSS in the constraints. Other primit ives are the tot mlogical constraints and the regions. The potent ia l energy flmction is a kind of the cost fllnetiolls which t~tkes all related paranmters and output the ('()st. The less the wthm of the potential (mergy flmction, the more credit the combinatiml of the gemnetric parameters gains. Using the gradient descendent method, the solution with nl ininnnn cost is calculated. The t)otcntial (mc.rgy flmction 1)rovides a means for accmnulat ing f l 'om fragnmntal'y infornuttion.

3 The Example
Suptlose that the fi)llowing sentences are the inputs to SPR INT .
(1) Fill V~i0 'Dq,~E~at , f I .g ;0%b/oo J (There is a fount;tin at the center of till, Yalnmshita Park.)
(2) [,f I*a) & ~_ 70~,65v,[$ ia)~a) l rq~. 5 ~:)klll)lt,~ ~& ~ &:0~ ~ 70. j (Front that place, you can sec Hikawa-maru (a slfip) Iwyond the fence of the park.)
(3) V).k JIl .,ic ~ ,~i N l,: l~. "q" ') "./47 V - g: / : o "C ~)5o j (There is a marine tOwl.r to tit(. right hand of Hikawa-mm'u.)
Frmn these sentences, SPR INT gets the surfttee eR.se str lwt l t res a, ttd interprel, s each eOllltection in tit(! structures to extr;u:t sp;ttial cons t ra ints . Tit(; ext.racled constraints in this example is shown in table 1.
Then SPR INT calculates the entity parameter vahles based Oll these COllstrailltS llSillg potential c.nergy flmctions. The exanq)le of the t)l)- tentiM energy fllllctioll is showlt ill figm'e 2. This is one which is used to calculate the location of the ship. In this figure, the line repre.sents the edge of the park. and the thither side of the line me;ms the inside of the t)ark. Finally SPR INT draw a world image (m the graphic display. This is shown in figure 3.
