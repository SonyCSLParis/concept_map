1. Int roduct ion
Informally, a disposition is a proposition which is preponderantly, but not necessarily always, true. Simple examples of dispositions are: Smoking is addictive, exercise is good for your health, long sentences are more difficult to parse than short sentences, overeating causes obesity, Trudi is always right, etc. Dispositions play a central role in human reasoning, since much of human knowledge and, especially, commousense knowledge, may be viewed as a collection of dispositions.
The concept of a disposition gives rise to a number of related concepts among which is the concept of a dispositional predicate. Familiar examples of unary predicates of this type are: Healthy, honest, optimist, safe, etc., with binary dispositional predicates exemplified by: taller than in Swedes are taller than Frenchmen, like in Italians are like Spaniards, like in youn 9 men like young women, and smokes in Ron smokes cigarettes. Another related concept is that of a dispositional command {or imperative) which is exemplified by proceed with caution, avoid overexertion, keep under refrigeration, be frank, etc.

The basic idea underlying the approach described in this paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition with suppressed, or, more generally, implicit fuzzy quantifiers such as most~ almost all, almost always, usually, rarely, much of the time, etc . To illustrate, the disposition gestating causes obesity may be viewed as the result of suppression of the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposition most of those who overeat are obese. Similarly, the disposition young men like young women may be interpreted as most young men like mostly young women. It should be stressed, however, that restoration (or ezplicitation) -- viewed as the inverse of suppression - is an interpretation-dependent process in the sense that, in general, a disposition may be interpreted in different ways depending on the manner in which the fuzzy quantifiers are restored and defined.
The implicit presence of fuzzy quantifiers stands in the way of representing the meaning of dispositional concepts through the use of conventional methods based on truthconditional, possible-world or model-theoretic semantics (Cresswell, 1973; McCawley, 1981; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1970),~-tn the computational approach which is described in this paper, a fuzzy quantifier is manipulated as a fuzzy number. This idea serves two purposes. First, it provides a basis for representing the meaning of dispositions; and second, it opens a way of reasoning with dispositions through the use of a collection of syllogisms. This aspect of the concept of a disposition is of relevance to default reasoning and nonmonotonic logic (McCarthy, 1980; McDermott and Doyle, 1980; McDermott, 1982; Reiter, 1983).
To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy quantifiers may be manipulated as fuzzy numbers, assume that, after restoration, two dispositions d I and d 2 may be expressed as propositions of the form
Pl A Qt A t s are BI s (1.1)
P2 A = Q2 Be s are CI s , (1.2) in which Ql and Q2 are fuzzy quantifiers, and A, B and C are fuzzy predicates. For example,
Pl &- most students are undergraduates (1.3)
P2 ~ most undergraduates are young .
By treating Pl and P2 as the major and minor premises in a syllogism, the following chaining syllogism may be established if B C A (Zadeh, 1983):
1. In the literature of linguistics, logic and philosophy of languages, fuzzy quantifiers are usually referred to as ~agne or generalized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Peterson, 1979). In the approach described in this paper, a fuszy quantifier is interpreted as a fuzzy number which provides an approximate characterization of absolute or relative cardinality.
Q: B I s are CI s
>_(QI ~ Q2) A#s are C's in which Q1 ~ Q2 represents the product of the fuzzy numbers QI and Q2 (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Multiplication of fuzzy quantifiers and ~_(Ql ~ Q:t) should be read as "at least Q1 ~ Q2." As shown in Figure 1, Q~ and Q2 are defined by their respective possibility distributions, which means that if the value of Q1 at the point u is a, then a represents the possibility that the proportion of A ~ s in B ~ s is u.
In the special case where Pl and P2 are expressed by (1.3), the chaining syllogism yields most students are undergraduates most nnderqradnates are vounq most 2 students are young where most ~ represents the product of the fuzzy number most with itself (Figure 2).

2. Meaning Representation and Test-Score Semantics To represent the meaning of a disposition, d, ~¢e employ a two-stage process. First, the suppressed fuzzy quantifiers in d are restored, resulting in a fuzzily quantified proposition p. Then, the meaning of p is represented -- through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982) - as a procedure which acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory database and returns a test score which represents the degree of compatibility of p with the database. In effect, this implies that p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraints which are tested, scored and aggregated by the meaningrepresentation procedure. In test-score semantics, these elastic constraints play a role which is analogous to that truthconditions in truth-conditional semantics (Cresswell, 1973).
As a simple illustration, consider the familiar example d A snow is white which we interpret as a disposition whose intended meaning is the proposition p A usually snow is white .
To represent the meaning of p, we assume that the ezplanatory database, EDF (Zadeh, 1982), consists of the following relations whose meaning is presumed to be known
EDF A WHITE [Sample;p] + USUALLY[Proport ion;p], in which + should be read as and. The ith row in WHITE is a tuple (Si,ri), i = 1,...,m, in which S i is the ith sample of snow, and ri is is the degree to which the color of S i matches white. Thus, r i may be interpreted as the test score for the constraint on the color of Si induced by the elastic constraint WHITE. Similarly, the relation USUALLY may be interpreted as an elastic constraint on the variable Proportion, with p representing the test score associated with a numerical value of Proportion.
The steps in the procedure which represents the meaning of p may be described as follows:
1. Find the proportion of samples whose color is white: r l -k • • • -b r m m in which the proportion is expressed as the arithmetic average of the test scores.
2. Compute the degree to which ¢ satisfies the constraint induced by USUALL Y: r ~ ~ USUALLY[Proportion ~ p] , in which r is the overall test score, i.e., the degree of compatibility of p with ED, and the notation ~R[X = a] means: Set the variable X in the relation R equal to a and read the value of the variable p.
More generally, to represent the meaning of a disposition it is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set. Specifically, if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourse U ---- {ul,...,u,}, then the sigma-count of A is defined as
~Count(A ) = I:~pA(U~), (2.1) in which pA(Ui), i ---- l,...,n, is the grade of membership of u/ in A (Zadeh, 1983a), and it is understood that the sum may be rounded, if need be, to the nearest integer. Furthermore, one may stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership falls below a specified threshold be excluded from the summation. The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation in which a large number of terms with low grades of membership become count-equivalent to a small number of terms with high membership.
The relative sigma-count, denoted by ~ Count( B / A ), may be interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A. More explicitly,
~Count (B /A ) --~ ~Count(A fl B) (2.2) ECount(a ) ' where B D A, the intersection of B and A, is defined by i tBnA(U) fUS/U) ^ US(U), U e U , where A denotes the s in operator in infix form. Thus, in terms of the membership functions of B and A, the relative slgma-count of B and A is given by
~,#B(u,) A tin(u,) Z Count( B / A } = (2.3}
~,tJa(u,) As an illustration, consider the disposition d A overating causes obesity (2.4) which after restoration is assumed to read 2 p A most of those who overeat are obese . (2.5)
To represent the meaning of p, we shall employ an explanatory database whose constituent relations are:
EDF ~- POPULATION[Nome; Overeat; Obese]
+ MOST(Proportion;it] .
The relation POPULA T ION is a list of names of individuals, with the variables Overeat and Obese representing, respectively, the degrees to which Name overeats and is obese. In MOST, p is the degree to which a numerical value of Proportion fits the intended meaning of MOST.
To test procedure which represents the meaning of p involves the following steps.
1. Let Name~, i - - 1 ..... m, be the name of ith individual in POPULATION. For each Name, find the degrees to which Namei overeats and is obese: ai A POVEREA r(Namei) A 0 ..... t POPULA T/ON(Name = Namei]
#, A ItonEsE( Namei} ~ o6,, POPULA TlON[Name ~ Namei] .
2. Compute the relative sigma-count of OBESE in OVEREAT:
=ia i A #i p @ ~Count (OBESE/OVEREAT)= E,a i
3. Compute the test score for the constraint induced by MOST: r -~ ~MOST[Proportion --~ p] .
This test score represents the compatibility of p with the explanatory database.
3. The Scope of a Fuzzy Quantif ier In dealing with the conventional quantifiers all and some in flint-order logic, the scope of a quantifier plays an essential role in defining its meaning. In the case of a fuzzy quantifier which is characterized by a relative sigma-count, what matters is the identity of the sets which enter into the relative count. Thus, if the sigma-count is of the form ECount (B /A ), which should be read as the proportion of B Is in A Is, then B and A will be referred to as the n-set [with n standing for numerator) and b-set (with b standing for base), respectively. The ordered pair {n-set, b-set}, then, may be viewed a~ a generalization of the concept of the scope of a quantifier. Note, however, that, in this sense, the scope of a fuzzy quantifier is a semantic rather than syntactic concept.
As a simple illustration, consider the proposition p A most students are undergraduates. In this case, the nset of most is undergraduates, the b-set is students, and the scope of most is the pair { undergraduates, students}.
2. It should be understood that (2.5) is just one of many possible interpret~.tions of (2.4), with no implicat;on that is constitutes a prescriptive interpretation of causality. See Suppes (1970}.
As an additional illustration of the interaction between scope and meaning, consider the disposition d A young men like young women . (3.1)
Among the possible interpretations of this disposition, we shall focus our attention on the following (the symbol rd denotes a restoration of a disposition): rd I A most young men like most young women rd 2 A most young men like mostly young women .
To place in evidence the difference between rd I and rdz, it is expedient to express them in the form rdl -~- most young men PI rd 2 ~ most young men P2 , where Pl and P2 are the fuzzy predicates
Pl A likes most young women and
P2 A likes mostly young women , with the understanding that, for grammatical correctness, likes in PI and P2 should be replaced by llke when Pl and P2 act as constituents of rd I and rd 2. In more explicit terms, PI and P2 may be expressed as
PI A P,[Name;p] (3.2)
P2 ~- P2[Name;p], in which Name is the name of a male person and # is the degree to which the person in question satisfies the predicate. [Equivalently, p is the grade of membership of the person in the fuzzy set which represents the denotation or, equivalently, the extension of the predicate.)
To represent the meaning of PI and P2 through the use of test-score semantics, we assume that the explanatory database consists of the following relations (gadeh, 1983b):
EDF A POPULATION(Name; Age; Sex] +
L lKE[Namel ;Name2; p] + YOUNG(Age; p] +
MOST(Proportion; It] .
In LIKE, it is the degree to which Namel likes Name9 ; and in YOUNG, it is the degree to which a person whose age is Age is young.
First, we shall represent the meaning of PI by the following test procedure.
1. Divide POPULAT ION into the population of males, M.POPULATION, and the population of females, F.POPULA TION:
M.POPULA T ION A N . . . . Ag, POPULA TION[Sez---Male]
F .POPULA TON A Ne,,,,age POPULA TION[Sez---Female] , where N~mc,AocPOPULATION denotes the projection of POPULAT ION on the attributes Name and Age.
2. For each Name:, j ~ 1 ..... L , in F.POPULATION, find the age of Namei:
Ai A Age F .POPULA T ION[Name~Namei ] .
3. For each Namei, find the degree to which Name i is young: ai A ~YOUNG[Age=Ai ] , where a i may be interpreted as the grade of membership of Name i in the fuzzy set, YW, of young women.
4. For each Namei, i= l , . . . ,K , in M.POPULATION, find the age of Namei:
Bi A Age M.POPULA TlON[Name---Namei] .
5. For each Namei, find the degree to which Namei likes Name i :
~ii ~- ~LIKE[Namel = Namel;Name2 = Namei] , with the understanding that ~i/ may be interpreted as the grade of membership of Name i in the fuzzy set, WLi, of women whom Name, likes.
6. For each Name/ find the degree to which Name, likes Name i and Name i is young:
"Tii A ai A #ii •
Note: As in previous examples, we employ the aggregation operator rain (A) to represent the meaning of conjunction. In effect, 70 is the grade of membership of Name i in the intersection of the fuzzy sets WLI and YW.
7. Compute the relative sigma-count of women whom Name i likes among young women:
Pi A ~Count tWL i /YW) (3.4)
ECount (WL i N YW)
~Count( YW)
_ ~i 76 a i
F. i a i
8. Compute the test score for the constraint induced by MOST: r i = ~ MOST[Proportion ---- Pi] (3.5)
This test-score way be interpreted as the degree to which Name i satisfies PI, i.e., ri = p PI [Name = Namei]
The test procedure described above represents the meaning of P,. In effect, it tests the constraint expressed by the proposition
E Count ( Y W/WL i ) is MOST and implies that the n-set and the b-set for the quantifier most in PI are given by: n-set = WLi = N.,.,2LIKE[Name 1 - -~ Namei] fl F .POPULA T ION and b-set = YW = YOUNG fl F .POPULA T ION .
By contrast, in the case of P2, the identities of the n-set and the b-set are interchanged, i.e., n-set = YW b-set = WL i , which implies that the constraint which defines P2 is expressed by
ECount( YW[ WLi) is MOST .

11.
Thus, whereas the scope of the quantifier most in PI is {WLi , YW}, the scope of mostly in P2 is { YW, WL~}.
Having represented the meaning of P1 and P~, it becomes a simple matter to represent the meaning of rd, and rd~. Taking rd D for example, we have to add the following steps to the test procedure which defines P r For each Namei, find the degree to which Name i is young:
6i A uYOUNG[Age = Bi] , where /f i may be interpreted as the grade of membership of Name i in the fuzzy set, YM, of young men. Compute the relative sigma-count of men who have property P* among young men:
6 &-- ~Count (P l /YM )
~Count(P i fl YM)
Test the constraint induced by MOST: r = ~MOST[Proportion=--p] .
The test score expressed by (3.6) represents the overall test score for the disposition d A young men like young women if d is interpreted as rd 1. If d is interpreted as rd2, which is a more likely interpretation, then the procedure is unchanged except that r i in (3.5) should he replaced by r i = ~MOST[Proportion -~- 6i] where 6, A ~Count (YW/WL, )
4. Representation of Dhspos|tlonal Commands and Concepts
The approach described in the preceding sections can be applied not only to the representation of the meaning of dispositions and dispositional predicates, but, more generally, to various types of semantic entities as well as dispositional concepts.
As an illustration of its application to the representation of the meaning of dispositional commands, consider dc A s tay away from bald men , (4.1) whose explicit representation will be assumed to be the comm and c A s tay away from most bald men . (4.2) The meaning of c is defined by its compliance criterion (gadeh, 1982) or, equivalently, its propositional content (Searle, 1979), which may be expressed as ee A staying away from most bald men .
To represent the meaning of ce through the use of testscore semantics, we shall employ the explanatory database
+ MOST[Proposition; #] .
The relation RECORD may be interpreted as a diary -- kept during the period of interest -- in which Name is the name of a man; pBald is the degree to which he is bald; and Action describes whether the man in question was stayed away from (Act ion~l ) or not (Action=0).
The test procedure which defines the meaning of dc may be described as follows:
1. For each Name i, i~ I ..... n, find (a) the degree to which Namel is bald; and (b) the action taken:
#Baldi A ,B~IdRECORD[Name --. Namei] Action i A a~tionRECORO[Nam e --. Namei] .
2. Compute the relative sigma-count of compliance:
1 [~i pBaldl A Acti°ni}" (4.3) p=- -#
3. Test the constraint induced by MOST: r = ~MOST[PropoMtion = p] • (4.4)
The computed test score expressed by (4.4) represents the degree of compliance with c, while the procedure which leads to r represents the meaning of de.
The concept of dispositionality applies not only to semantic entities such as propositions, predicates, commands, etc., but, more generally, to concepts and their definitions. As an illustration, we shall consider the concept of typicality -- a concept which plays a basic role in human reasoning, especially in default reasoning '(Reiter, 1983), concept formation (Smith and Media, 1981), and pattern recognition (Zadeh, 1977}.
Let U be a universe of discourse and let A be a fuzzy set in A (e.g., U A cars and A ~ station wagons). The definition of a typical element of A may be expressed in verbal terms as follows: t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.5)
(a) t has a high grade of membership in A, and (b) most dements of ,4 are similar to t.
it should be remarked that this definition should be viewed as a dispositional definition, that is, as a definition which may fail, in some cases, to reflect our intuitive perception of the meaning of typicality.
To put the verbal definition expressed by (4.5) into a more precise form, we can employ test-score semantics to represent the meaning of (a) and (h). Specifically, let S be a similarity relation defined on U which associates wi~h each element u in U the degree to which u is similar to t ~. Furthermore, let S(t) be the Mmilarity clas~ of t, i.e., the fuzzy set of elements of U which are similar to t. ~Vhat this means is that the grade of membership of u in S(t) is equal to #s(t,u), the degree to which u is similar to t (Zadeh, 1971).
Let HIGH denote the fuzzy subset of the unit interval which is the extension of the fuzzy predicate high. Then, the verbal definition (4.5) may be expressed more precisely in the form: t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.6)
3. For consistency with the definition of A, S must be such that if u and u I have a high degree of similarity, then their grades of membership in A should be close in magnitude.
(a) Pa( t ) is HIGH (b) ECount(S(t)/A ) is MOST.
The fuzzy predicate high may be characterized by its membership function PHtCH or, equivalently, as the fuzzy reinton IIIGfI [Grade; PL in which Grade is a number in the interval [0,1] and p. is the degree to which the value of Grade fits the intended meaning of high.
An important implication of this definition is that typicality is a matter of degree. Thus, it follows at once from (4.6) that the degree, r, to which t is typical or, equivalently, the grade of membership of t in the fuzzy set of typical elements of A, is given by r = tHIGH[Grade = t] A (4.7) aMOST[Proportion = ~, Count(S(t)/A ] .
In terms of the membe~hip functions of HIGH, MOST,S and A, (4.7} may be written as
[ ~, Pstt, u) A PA( u) I r A V.-LF.  J' (4.8) where tHIGH, PMOSr, PS and PA are the membership functions of HIGH, MOST, S and A, respectively, and the summation Zu extends over the elements of U.
It is of interest to observe that if pa( t ) ----- 1 and
.s(t,n) = ~a(u) , (4.9) that is, the grade of membership of u in A is equal to the degree of similarity of u to t, then the degree of typicality of t is unity. This is reminiscent of definitions of prototypicality (Rosch, 1978) in which the grade of membership of an object in a category is assumed to be inversely related to its "distance" from the prototype.
In a definition of prototypicality which we gave in gadeh (1982), a prototype is interpreted as a so-called a-summary. In relation to the definition of typicality expressed by (4.5), we may say that a prototype is a a -summary of typical elements of A. In this sense, a prototype is not, in general, an element of U whereas a typical element of A is, by definition, an clement of U. As a simple illustration of this difference, assume that U is a collection of movies, and A is the fuzzy set of Western movies. A prototype of A is a summary of the summaries {i.e., plots) of Western movies, and thus is not a movie. A typical Western movie, on the other hand, is a movie and thus is an element of U.
5. Fuzzy Syllogisms A concept which plays an essential role in reasoning with dispositions is that of a fuzzy syllogism (Zadeh, 1983c). As a general inference schema, a fuzzy syllogism may be expressed in the form
QIA'a are Bin (5.1) Q2 CI8 are D Is fQs E ' a are F~ a where Ql and Q2 are given fuzzy quantifiers, Q3 is fuzzy quantifier which is to be determined, and A, /3, C, D, E and F are interrelated fuzzy predicates.
In what follows, we shall present a brief discussion of two basic types of fuzzy syllogisms. A more detailed description of these and other fuzzy syllogisms may be found in Zadeh (1983c, 1984).
The intersection~product syllogism may be viewed as an instance of (5.1) in which
F A B andD , and Qa= Q1 ~ Q2, i.e-, Qa is the product of QI and Q2in fuzzy arithmetic. Thus, we have as the statement of the syllogism:
Q1A's are B' s (5.2)
QT(A and B)' s arc CI s
(Q1 (~ Q2) A Is are (Band C)ls •
In particular, if B is contained in A, i.e., PB --< PA, where PA and P8 are the membership functions of A and B, respectively, then A and B = B, and (5.2) becomes
Q1A's are Be s (5.3)
Q~ B ' s arc CI s
(QI ~ Q2) A 's are (B andC) 's .
Since B and C implies C, it follows at once from (5.3) that
Q1A I s arc BI s (5.4)
Q2 BI s are C' s
>(QI ~ Q2) A ' s arc C 's , which is the chaining syllogism expressed by (1.4). Furthermore, if the quantifiers Q] and Q2 are monotonic, i.e., >- QI - - Q1 and _> Q2 = Q2, then (5.4) becomes the product syllogism
QI A e s are B ' s (5.5)
Q~ B Is are C Is
(QI ~ Q2) A ' s ore C 's the case of the consequent conjunction syllogism, we ]n have
C~_A
E~_A
QI A's are B 's (5.0)
Q:Afs are C Is
Qa A e s are (B and C) Is where Q is a fuzzy number (or interval) defined by the inequalities
0~(Q 1 • Q201)_~ Q _~ QI~)Q2, (5.7) where (~ , ~ ~ and @ are the operations of addition, subtraction, rain and max in fuzzy arithmetic.
As a simple illustration, consider the dispositions dl A students are young d 2 ~-- students are single.
Upon restoration, these dispositions become the propositions
Pl A most students are young
P2 A most students are single
Then, applying the consequent conjunction syllogism to Pl and P2, we can infer that
Q students are single and young where
2 most 01 <_ Q <_ most . (5.8)
Thus, from the dispositions in question we can infer the disposition d A students are ,ingle and young on the understanding that the implicit fuzzy quantifier in d is expressed by (5.8).
6. Negat ion of Dispositlona In dealing with dispositions, it is natural to raise the question: What happens when a disposition is acted upon with an operator, T, where T might be the operation of negation, active-to-passive transformation, etc. More generally, the same question may be asked when T is an operator which is defined on pairs or n-tuples of disp?sitions.
As an illustration, we shall focus our attention on the operation of negation. More specifically, the question which we shall consider briefly is the following: Given a disposition, d, what can be said about the negaton of d, not d? For example, what can be said about not (birds can fly) or not (young men like young women).
For simplicity, assume that, after restoration, d may be expressed in the form rd A Q A W s are B Is . (6.1)
Then, not d = not (Q A ' s ore B ' s ) . (6.2)
Now, using the semantic equivalence established in Zadeh (1978), we may write not (Q A 's are B 's )E (not Q)A 's ore B 'o , (6.3) where not Q is the complement of the fuzzy quantifier Q in the sense that the membership function of not Q is given by
P,,ot Q(u).~- 1-pQ(u) ,0 < u < 1 . (6.4)
Furthermore, the following inference rule can readily be established (gadeh, 1983a):
Q A ' s ore B ' s (0.5) ~__ (ant Q ) A I s arc not B t o ' where ant Q denotes the antonym of Q, defined by
~, , ,~(u) = ~q(1-n) , o < u < 1 , (6.o)
On combining (0.3) and (0.5), we are led to the following result: not(Q A # s are B' s )= (6.7) >_ (oat (not q)) A ' o ore not Bt , which reduces to
(ant (not q)) A ' , are not B ' * if Q is monotonic (e.g., Q A most). As an illustration, if d A birds can fly and Q A most, then (0.8) yields not (birds can fly) (ant (not most)) birds cannot f l y . (o.g)
It should be observed that if Q is an approximation to all, then ant(not Q) is an approximation to some. For the right-hand member of (0.9) to be a disposition, most must be an approximation to at least a half. In this case ant [not most] will be an approximation to most, and consequently the righthand member of (0.9) may be expressed -- upon the suppression of most -- as the disposition birds cannot fly.
