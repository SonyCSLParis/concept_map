1 In t roduct ion In order to improve the man-machine interface with computers, the <tevelopment of input devices such as optical cha.racter tea<lets (OCR) or speech recognition devices are expected, llowew;r, it is not easy to input Japanese sentences J)y these devices, because. they are written by many kinds of characters, especially thousands of "kanji" characters. The sentences input through an OCR. or a speech recognition device usuMly contain erroneous character strings.
The techniques of natural language processing are expected to find and correct these errors. tIowever, since current technologies of natural language analysis have been developed for correct sentences, they cannot directly be applied to these problems. Up to now, statistical approaches have been made to this problem.
Markov mo<lels are considered to be one of" machine learning models, sinfilar to neural networks a.nd fuzzy models. They have been applied to character chains of natural lang,,a~ges (e.g.,l);nglish)[l],[2], a.nd to phoneme reco~gnition 3 . [41 cha.ins in continuous speech. . [ 1~1. ¢1' 2nd-orde.r Markov model nt bunsets',l is known to be useful to correct errors in "kanjikana." "/m nsetsu" [(;],to choose a correct syllable chain from Japa.nese syllable "bunsetsu" candidates [7], and to re(!nce the ambiguities in translation processing of non-segmented "kana." sentences into "kanji-kana" sentences [8].
The erroneous characters can be classilied Ul,O three types, lhe hrst is w~ongly recognized chal;aclers instead of correct (haracters. The second and the third are wrongly inserted and deleted (skipped) characters respectively. Markov chain mode.Is above mentioned were restricted to tind and correct the first type of errors[5],[6]. No method has been proposed for correcting errors of the second and the. third types. 'Phe. rea.son might be considered to be I.he di[ticulties of finding the error location and distinguishing between deletion and insertion er I ' o rs .
On the other hand, contextual algorithm utilizing ,,-g,'atn letl.er statistics (e.g.[.()]) a,,d a dictionary look-ul) algorithm[10] have been discussed to detect a.nd correct erroneous characters in English sentences, which is segmented into words.
This paper proposes new methods, which are able to be applied to a nor>segmented chains or" characters, to judge three types of the errors, which are characters wrongly subst.ituted, deleted a.nd inserted in a Japanese "bunsetsu", and to correct these errors in Japanese "kanji-l<ana" chains using m-th o f der Markov chain model. The methods are based on the idea about the relation between the types of errors and the length of a chain in which the wdnes of Markov joint probability remain small, l,'urthermore, this method is applied to detect and correct errors in segmented English words•
Experiments were conducted for the case of 2nd-order and 3rd-order Markov model, and they were applied to Japanese and English newspaper arhcles. Relevance Factor 1 and "Reeall Factor" R for erroneous characters detected and corrected by this method were experimentally evaluated using statistical data for 70 issues of a daily Japanese newspaper and 5 issues of a daily English newspaper.
2 Basic Def in i t ions and the Method of Error Detect ion and Error Correct ion using 2nd-Order Markov Mode l
2,1 Bas ic Definit ions
In this paper, two types of natural language's sentences are discussed. One is a Japanese sentence, which is non-segmented sentence and the other is an English sentence, which is segmented into words.
A Japanese sentence can be separated into syntactic units called '%unsetsu", where a
{~" ( "bunsetsu" is composed of one m lependent word" and ~ sequence of n (greater than equal to 0) "dependent words".
A "bunsetsu" is a chain of Japanese "kanjikana" characters or an English word is a chain of alphabets, and are represented by 3' = sl s2...s,~, where s~ is a "kanji-kana" character or an alphabet. In particular, a chain, 7 , is called a "J-bunsetsu" when all of its elements are "kanji-kana" characters, and is called a "[iJ- word" when all of its elements are English alphabets. The set of eorre, ct .lapanese "bunsetsu" or English words is represented by Pc.
Three types of erroneous "J-bunsetsu" or E-word are dehned as follows: First, a chain ce = N,¢~... s[Zlg;.., s,;~ is called a "(i,k)-Erroneous J-bunsetsu or E- word Wrongly Substituted " ( (i, k ) -EWS) if a subehain fl = t l tu . . . Ih is wrongly substituted at the location i of ce, that is 3 7 C- re , -y = ~(o11/< Here ~(Ollf3 donotes substitution of a subchain fl at, the location i in a chain c~ , that is, d01i/  - 8- iS - 2 • "" S i - - l l l ¢ 2 "" • [ ,kS i -+k " ' " ,S'~n , and l I 6- - &," ' , tk ~-- s iq~- , .
Next, a chain c~ = &g.,.. . si~_lgi . . . s;,~ is called a "(i,k)-Erroneous J-bunsetsu or I';- word Wrongly Deleted" ( ( i ,~) -~WD) if a subchMn fl = t~t=...tk is wrongly deleted at the location i of a, that is ~7 ~ l'c, "y = c~ (1) << ft. Here {,(0 << fl denotes insertion of a subchain fl at the location i in a chain c, , that is, a (0 << fl -- s't.sS"' Si~-l l t l2 "" " lk ,q i ' ' " S~n.
Finally, a chain cr = .¢t • "" s[ - lg i "" si-(k-1 s ;+k" ' s;,~ is also called "(i, k)-Erroneous J- bunsetsu or F~word Wrongly Inserted" ( ( i , k ) -EWI ) if a sul)chain /3 = t l t~ . . . tk is wrongly inserted at the location i of % that is 37 E Pc', 7 = d;) >> ft. tIere c~ (1) >> fl denotes deletion of a subchain f3 at the location i in a chain c~ , that is, at0 >> fl = .¢~'2 ' "s iZ ls i+~" 'sZ , and tl = g l , ' " , tk = S i+k-1 .
The set of (i ,k)-EWS, (i, k')-EWD and
(i, k)-EWI are represented by P(~)s', P~) and 17(1 ~) respectively. In this paper, all inputs "bunsetsn" or all inputs words to computers are assumed to belong to one of l-'c , p(k)s , P~) and 1'(1 k). Next, the meaning of detecting and correcting errors are define.d in the Nllowing. The words, "error detection problem", means the problem how to detect the location i of error in if, and "error correction problem" means the problem how to replace an erroneous "d-bunsetsu" or an "E-word" ~v by a correct "bunsetsu" or an English word 7, where s ,aEP , o reeEP aud ' rc ic . "Relevance Factor" p(D) and "Recall l)'actor" R (D) for tile "error detection problem" is defined as follows: ]): p(D) at ( the number of "J-bunsetsu" or 2 ' '~ " t,. of the ],-word location i and length k error ill I '(k) p(k) ]7,5k) .s' , "n or is correctly detected q he total number of J-lmnsetsu or B- ) / ,, . . ,, word detected as erroneous ,l-bunsetsn or "E-word"). (2): R.

"Releva.nce factor" p(C) and "Recall factor" R (c) for the, "error correction problem" is also similarly defined. Here p}D) denotes the "Relevance Factor" for tile "error detection prob-
~(k) (c) lem" of ] ~' , and R D denotes the "Recall Factor" for the "error correction problem" of p(k) respectively.

2.2 The Method of Error Detect ion us ing 2nd-Order Markov Mode l
We introduce the following assumption according to the experiences.
Assumption Each Markov probability for erroneous chains of "ka@-kana" characters or English alphabets is small compared to that of correct chains. !
According to this assumption, the. procedure. of detecting the location i .~nd the length k of error chains arc detined as follows:
Pwcedure 1 ( Method of detecting the location and the length of chain wrongly substituted in p(.k) and substituted or in.qerted in sPi~[(l the subchMn of lelx~th k which satisfy the followin~ conditions..['his chain is iudge~t to be wrongly inserted at the location ~.

And T denotes a critical v',dne of m-th order Markov probability used for detecting errors.

In this ex~tmph{, [wo charaet,ers are wrongly substituted or inserted. According to the previous assumption, 2nd-order Markov probability for erroneous~:!tain remain smaller value than eriticM value l just four tinms.

However, this method can not distinguish the erroneous characters wrongly substituted, from the characters wrongly inserted in the former c~e~ and can not determine the length k for the type of 1?~ ), because the Markov probability of any erroneous chmns in Pl) ~) remMns small value just the same times for length k. These problems can be solved by the procedt/re 3 and 4 shown in Sec.2.3.
In this paper, the effect to detect errors for cases of length k = 1, 2 is evaluated.
2.3 The Method of Error Correct ion using 2rid-Order Markov Model
The procedure of replacing erroneous chains by correct chains using Markov model is presented as follows:

[3] The Combinatorial Effect to Correct Erroneous Lnghsh Words Using the Spell Checker and the Correction Procedure by Marker Model
The experimental results of detecting errors in English words using Ispell ( Interactive Spell checker ) is shown in Table 2. l?rom the results, it is seen that Ispell cart almost perfectly detect erroneous words in U~, I'~) and P s. using dictionary, but it cannot perfectly cur rect erroneous words, because it can output the correct candidates for erroneous words in p~), r(~), pO)s, but can not output the correct candidates for erroneous words in F~ ~), P(~) ~1) 1 F~ ~). I t is necessary todetect the l ocat ionofer - roneous a lphabets in words to detect M I these er rors . However , i t shou ld be noted that [ s - pe l l can not detect the l ocat ion o f e r roneous alphabets in words.
In order to detect and correct erroneous "E- word" more effectively, the method to combine Ispell and the procedure ( in see. 2.3 ) using Markov model is expected• The combinatorial method is denoted in the following way: (1) At first, erroneous "E-words" are detected by Ispell, but the locations of erroneous alphabets in words can not be detected by it. (2) Next decide the correct candidates words by procedure 3 and 4. (3) Finally, ls!)ell again checks if these candidates are correct words. The experimental results using this method is shown in Fig. 6(2nd-order) and in Fig. 7( 3rd-order ). From the results, it is seen that this combinatorial method of Ispell and the procedure by 3rd-order Markov model to very useflfl to detect and correct all errors in English words.
It takes about 10 milli-seeonds and 6 seconds in average to detect and to correct erroneous "bunsetsu" . Examples of "bunsetsu" and the output results of error de]cotion and error correction using Mm!kov model, are shown in Fig. 8.

The effects of the methods were experimentally ev;dnated for the case of 2ndand 3rdorder M~rkov chain. ~'rom the exI)erimental results, the following conclusions have been obt;dned:
1. The m;~ximum vahte of P ;rod .le of detecting erroneous ch~racters wrongly inserte<l or substituted, is greater than that of erroneous ehm'aeLers wrongly deleted.
2. This method is specially useful to detect ~md correct erroneous characters wrongly inserted att(l substituted in "k~mji-l~a,n~ ~' "bunsetsu", but is not so useful 1.(; detect. and correct errors in English words.
3. The combin,~toriM method of lspell a.nd the procedure by ard-order M arkov model is usefull to detect and correct all errors in Fmglish words.
llowever they are not so usefltl for detecting and correcting of eharactells, wrongly deleted in "k,~I\ji-kana" "bunsetsu". 1: hen, m(>re e.flicient rrmthods are expected for this type of errors.
