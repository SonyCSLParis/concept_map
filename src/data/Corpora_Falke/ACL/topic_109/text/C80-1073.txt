Int roduct ion 4 Natura l ly occur ing task -or iented dia logs are the joint product of the interact ions of (at least) two par t ic ipants who know how to cooperate , i. e. who know how to organize
- their verbal interact ions, and
- their task -or iented interact ions.
The amount of such in teract ions which seem to be necessary in spec i f ic taskor iented d ia logs may
(i) depend on a number of factors given in advance such as: readiness to cooperate (a), prec iseness of the task representat ion (b), amount of mutua l ly shared taskspeci f ic knowledge (c), amount of knowledge about the other part i - c ipant (d) and personal factors as for example competence and (self-) conf idence (e);
(ii) depend on procedures apt to modify these factors (a - e) in an e f f i c ient and pos i t ive way;
(iii) depend on procedures used for task resolut ion and result explanat ion.
Par t ic ipants of natura l ly occur ing taskor iented dia logs are able to make use of these factors and procedures in a sk i l l fu l and f lexible way, but such propert ies are st i l l lacking even in exper imenta l d ia log systems.
In past natura l language process ing research cons iderab le ef forts have been made to process the structures underly ing sentences or texts. Procedures have been developed which bui ld up deep structures of sentences or which determine macro -s t ructures or event skr ipts ('frames') under ly ing texts. In the next two years specia l ef forts wi l l be made to process the structures underly ing task -or iented dialogs.
Representat ion of In teract iona l
Knowledge accounts of the sequent ia l organizat ion of d ia log interact ions have been developed, e. g. for turn taking, for opening sequences, for c los ing or repair sequences 7 or for d i f ferent types of task -or iented verbal interact ion as a whole (e. g. g iv ing advice, d irections, explanat ions) 12 But these accounts have only Deen of a s t ruc tura l type, not of a procedura l type. A formal representat ion has rarely been attempted 6 and an integrat ion or interact ion of d i f ferent knowledge sources is genera l ly not considered.

In the subsequent sect ions we wi l l argue for a level of representat ion gu id ing the soc ia l in teract iona l and the verbal in teract iona l aspects of task -or iented d ia logs . A personal be l ie f or knowledge component wi l l use in format ion of this i n te ract iona l level together wi th informat ion of a task level as wel l as informat ion of a sentence/ text level. We wi l l argue for a procedura l representat ion of in teract iona l knowledge and we think that the usefu lness of ATNS I0'3 for such a representat ion should be examined in more detail .
other computat iona l d ia log models in the fo l lowing way:
- A d ia log model is not based on an un- 2 der ly ing d ia log prototype spec i fy ing essent ia l l y task -or iented informat ion.
It is c la imed that the social interact ional and the verbal in teract iona l aspects of task -or iented dia logs are important enough to be represented in a deta i led way on a specia l level.
- Dia log proport ies are not only examined by prob lem so lv ing techniques I.
Instead, extended pars ing techniques are used in 'parsing interact ions ' and they are supposed to be he lpfu l in determin ing the in teract iona l s t ructure under ly ing utterances.
Let us further speci fy the k ind of interact ional knowledge which par t i c ipants of certa in types of task -or iented d ia logs are supposed to have as wel l as ways to represent it. The par t ic ipants wi l l genera l ly know how to manage the social, the verbal and the task -or iented interactions. They wi l l genera l ly know about several rather invariant, components of a certa in type of task -or iented d ia logs as wel l as of a normal sequence of these components. They know about the deta i led
(alternative) st ructures of each component, the choice of which may depend on factors as were ment ioned above(a - e).
They know
- how to in i t iate a social contact /a verbal in teract ion and how to respond pos i t i ve ly /negat ive ly to this in i t iative; action,
- how to s ignal ize interest, competence or d i f f i cu l t ies of) understand ing,
- how to organ ize turntak ing,
- how to in i t iate the te rminat ion of a social contact /a verbal in teract ion and how to respond pos i t i ve ly or negat ively to it.
as sequences of soc ia l /verba l interact ions, formal ly to be represented as connected (sub-) networks of an ATN.
I. e. soc ia l /verba l in teract ion is seen as a process of path se lect ion of (at least) two par t i c ipants in a network of states and state t rans i t ions. These
(sub-) networks should be set up on an empir ica l bas is ( recordings of natura l ly occur ing task -or iented dialogs).
An Example knowledge ment ioned above may be represented in an ATN in a s t ra ight fo rward way, whereas the representat ion of others seem less s t ra ight forward.
Const i tuents
Let us assume that some types of informat ion -g iv ing dia logs may be ass igned a
-488 network st ructure w i th the fo l lowing const i tuents of soc ia l /verba l interaction:
- on the level of a d ia log type (a),
- on the level of speech act sequences
(b), or - on the level of tu rn - tak ing organi - zat ion (c).
The arcs indicate (alternative) state t rans i t ions / (a l te rnat ive) courses of interact ion. They may be marked or unmarked ('JUMPs').
Accord ing to fig. I a d ia log interact ion may start:
- w i th a contact in i t ia t ing ut terance
( "EXCUSE ME ..."), level a;
- w i th a quest ion in t roducer ("MAY I
ASK YOU ...") level b;
- wi th a task -spec i f i c quest ion ("WHERE
DO I F IND ..."), level b;
- w i th a 'turn introducer ' ("YES"I "...") , level c.
(cf--~4--~arrow), repeated ( loons; i teration) or some sequences nay ~e embedded into other sequences (cf. QUESTION/
ANSWER arc in the QUEST ION/ANSWER subnetwork; recurs ion) .
networks w i th the same type of informat ion or wi th other types of in for - mation: cogn ize /generate d i f ferent forms (e. g.
to in i t iate a contact, to int roduce quest ions, topass turns) or d i rect / ind i rect ways to ask a quest ion ("9~ERE
DO I F IND ..." vs "I DO NOT KNOW ...",
"I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW ..."); task-oriented in format ion in order to bu i ld up coherent sets of answers (on the basis of a task-model) .
- -489- -
ASK YOU ..." ut tered at the beg inn ing of a d ia log in i t iates a contact and in t roduces a quest ion.) Specia l tests on arcs wi l l recognize this and the cor respond ing act ions wi l l bu i ld up an in teract iona l s t ructure accord ing to such mul t ip le roles of const i tuents . (A way to see them from d i f ferent perspect ives. )
In terpretat ion of Arcs
The in teract ionaÂ± in format ion represented in an ATN-subnet may be used to plan and to guide the recogn i t ion /generat ion of soc ia l /verba l in teract ion as part of a task -or iented dialog. The in format ion represented on an arc should be used for both, for recogn i t ion as wel l as for p lann ing /generat ion . The st ructure of the
(sub-)networks is usefu l in the sense that 'normal' courses of in teract ion are exp l i c i ty represented. So they are expected and ind icate a k ind of interact ional coherence of a task -or iented dialog. But speakers may v io late such normal ly respected d ia log sequences and they can cope with this fact. It is there fore des i rab le to make a more f lexib le use of the in format ion represented in a network. E. g. it seems des i rab le to ca lcu late a (not yet exist ing) trans i t ion on the basis of task -spec i f i c cues and/or ut terance cues (for example when a par t i c ipant reopens an a l ready c losed subtask or when he repeats or reopens an a l ready executed move or when he suddenly terminates an interaction.
It seems des i rab le to have an extended
ATN parser in order to cope with unexpected d ia log sequences. In implement ing aspects of soc ia l /verba l in teract ions one should examine carefu l ly ef forts made 5,9
- to use an ATN in a more f lexib le way
- to combine recogn i t ion and generat ion in an ATN 8, and
- to bui ld up several in teract ing ATNs".
