This was such an odd time to visit some place on a holiday, but we were told that one must reach there for a stunning sunrise. Borobudur was constructed around the same period as the Shiva Prambanan temple, which is depicted by significant Hindu structures in the temple. It is one of the few sites where you feel lucky that you have visited, seen & photographed it.
