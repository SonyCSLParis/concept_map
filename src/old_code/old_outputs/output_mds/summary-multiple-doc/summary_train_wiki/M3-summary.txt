A monk was waiting for us in front of five beautiful stone statues, which were displayed in a bank of water. There was a stone statue of a starving Buddha and another of the Buddha after he had found a balance. For example, on the first level which is that of desire, there were stories about gossip, prostitution and alcohol.
