It doesn't do any child any good to hear her parents say that school is "a waste of time," that school rules are "dumb," or that what she's learning is "stupid" or "useless." Teachers are always looking for parents to:  Share expertise in a particular subject area related to your job or hobbies  Read to children  Conduct writing workshops, or help children "publish" their books  Tutor kids who need extra help, or work with a small group of advanced students in math or other subjects  Chaperone field trips  Sew costumes for a school play, bake cupcakes for a party, or cut out paper shapes for a class project  Type up a classroom newsletter or literary magazine If you have lots of time to give, you might consider:  Being a "class parent" (the person who acts as a liaison between the teacher and the other parents  rounding up chaperones for school trips, for instance, or finding volunteers to bake for the class bake sales)  Being a playground monitor  Joining the school's parent/teacher association  Joining the principal's school advisory committee (if there is one)  Running for your local school board At the very least, you should plan to make time to attend:  Special events to which parents are invited (a Mother's Day brunch, prepared by the children, for instance; or a Writer's Tea, at which children read their stories aloud to their parents)  Special school events, such as the annual Holiday Show or Spring Musical 9. Ask your child about school every day It isn't always easy to get the scoop on school from your own child.
