Workers should not be exposed to other people's smoke, since they may not have made a free choice to do so. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. While 70% of Europeans are non-smokers, 86% are in favour of a ban on smoking at work, 84% in other public places, 61% in bars and pubs and 77% in restaurants.
