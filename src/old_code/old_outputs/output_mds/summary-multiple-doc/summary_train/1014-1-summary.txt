This has made it possible for them to calculate the price elasticity for teenagers and compare it with the generally accepted price elasticity of cigarettes for the total smoking population. Their calculation of the quantity smoked elasticity for teenagers is -1.4, which means that a ten percent increase in price would lead to a 14 percent decline in cigarette consumption by teenagers.
