- William Butler Yeats by Wolf Hatch Some parents send their kids to school because they want to get rid of them so they can have some time to themselves instead of teaching their kids at home. The teacher doesn't know each child well enough to know what is and what isn't too hard, but with home schoolers it is always their mom who gives them homework or assignments to do and what I think is that kids' mothers should know more about what is too hard or too much for their kids than teachers do. A number of strategies are discussed by Mr Hirsch and his colleagues, but the most promising is a return to content in the classroom.
