Charter Schools are public schools, they are funded by the government with tax dollars. I am not questioning the value of Charter, Online Schools, or other public school options that allow students to do their work at home, I am just asking that they not be called homeschools Homeschooling, as I'm defining it, means that you and your children pick the resources and curriculum that you will use. My goal was not to give charter schools a bad rap and I tried to be clear that I think it is a viable option...but amongst the families I speak with most have never considered any of the reasons to not join a Charter and I wished to offer the other side of the issue.
