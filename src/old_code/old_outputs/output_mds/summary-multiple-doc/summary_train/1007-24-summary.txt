"I have a fear of going to the toilet when people are around. I can't remember life before my toilet phobia and when I could use the toilet with people around. I just have the thought all the time that I will poo myself I don't even like it when people come round to me house incase they go on the toilet for ages and I have a panic attack when my partner is on the toilet because there isn't a loo I can use.
