As cable outlets such as Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network gained traction, advertisers had even more opportunity, as those venues broadcast kid-focused programming during even more hours of the day and days of the week. "If I were in the business of spending real dollars, I wouldn't be so naive as to say, 'OK, we'll do Nickelodeon, and that'll do it,' or even MTV," said Tom Donohue, professor of mass communications and psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University. All of these kids are growing up with cellphones or Nintendos or PSPs in their hands, and I don't think we are really portraying that very well," he said.
