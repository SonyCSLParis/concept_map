Of course, it's much more difficulty to be empathetic when you're angry with your kids or disappointed in their behavior - but that's when it's most important. Of course, accepting your kids for who they are doesn't mean that you should excuse inappropriate behavior, but try to understand it and help change it in a way that doesn't erode their self-esteem. If you're teaching your child to ride a two-wheeler, for example, tell her that it takes time to learn how to balance and that most kids fall at first.
