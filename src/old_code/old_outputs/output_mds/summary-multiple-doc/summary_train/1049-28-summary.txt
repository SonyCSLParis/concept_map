I don't expect to achieve it in it's purest form (and there is a lot of debate about what, exactly, that is.) There are a lot of great books out there and there are many, many people who will recommend their favorites to you. We have never been waldorf hardliners and it's nice to hear that there are others who try to toe the line as we do with TV and culture in general.
