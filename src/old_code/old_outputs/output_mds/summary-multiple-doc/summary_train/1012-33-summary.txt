We were very excited (and continue to be) to be able to teach our children according to the curriculum, values, and schedule that reflect our family. Furthermore, we need to be telling our fellow Christians in other churches to homeschool their kids, for this is the only way to achieve our goal. The solution is not homeschooling, it is the gospel of Jesus Christ and participating in the growing kingdom of God.
