Worrying: A new study reveals that smoking infront of children not only passes on the harmful effects of the smoke in the air - it can also get them hooked on cigarettes 'Kids who see others smoking are more likely to take up the habit because they don't perceive cigarettes as unhealthy,' says lead study author Simon Racicot, of Concordia University's Department of Psychology. 'When it comes to smoking around kids, the best thing a parent can do is to avoid exposing their kids to cigarettes and to secondhand smoke,' says Racicot. " tweens who repeatedly observe a parent, sibling or neighbour smoking are more likely to start smoking themselves " On the other hand if they see their old Gran or their elderly neighbour smoking, they may be inclined to wonder why we,re constantly fed all this twaddle.
