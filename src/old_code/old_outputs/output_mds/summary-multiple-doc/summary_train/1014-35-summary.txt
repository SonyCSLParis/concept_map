In Hong Kong, the Youth Quitline, is a pioneering initiative of its kind, delivering telephone counseling services specifically catered to the needs of teenagers aged 12 to 25, smokers and non-smokers alike. As targets of the hotline are local teenagers in the city, the Quitline recruits students from the School of Medicine, School of Nursing and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong as peer counselors to help run the service. Upon the teenagers' first call to the Quitline, it marks the beginning of a two-year service with the hotline.
