Results indicated that one of the strongest protective factors for reducing the risk of experimenting with smoking in early adolescence was how often fathers talked with their children, both boys and girls, about 'things that mattered'. Dr White, who presents his findings to the British Psychological Society's Annual Conference in April 2010, said: "This study suggests that a greater awareness of parents' and especially fathers' potential impact upon their teenagers' choices about whether to smoke is needed. As well as their smoking, the children were also asked about the frequency of parental communication, arguments with family members and the frequency of family meals.
