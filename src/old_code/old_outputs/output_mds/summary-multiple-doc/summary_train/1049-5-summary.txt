:) Here are the questions people have asked so far (and my apologies for not matching names to questions...I started to but realized it'll take too long): I have heard it said that anthroposophy views the child as an unblemished creature who needs to be treated with extreme care and reverence; in other words--Original Sin does not exist. "From what I understand, the followers of this method like the idea of having a rhythm to their days, focusing on a lot of art and nature, telling stories, singing songs, respecting the child, etc...to me there is nothing extraordinary there. other than "waldorf".
