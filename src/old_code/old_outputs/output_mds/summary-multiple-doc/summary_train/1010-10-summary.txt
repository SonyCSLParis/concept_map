When I began homeschooling my oldest daughter I was a little bit concerned because of the horror stories. You also know that if you are ever contacted by a truancy officer or social services worker on a homeschooling matter you can call HLA and they will offer legal advice, and representation, if necessary. And no matter if you read up on the legal issues yourself, or use an outside group like HLA, make sure that you are keeping accurate, up-to-date records of what you are teaching and how your child is progressing in your homeschool.
