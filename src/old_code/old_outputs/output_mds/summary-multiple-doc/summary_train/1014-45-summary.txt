From a mum, who has been to hell and back , with her kids, so i know what i am talking about And I am sick to death of people thinking alcohol is not a drug that can kill the first time you take it, yes it can as has been proved over and over again, the problem isn't necessarily the drugs but what drug dealers mix with the drugs to maximise their profit, maybe one answer is for the government to legalise drugs, at least then people that want to take drugs will know the quality is O.K., I know kids aren't supposed to drink and take drugs, but it's an unfortunate fact of life they do and will always do, so surely it is better if they at least get safe gear, all I can say is I will not judge the young girl that died, and my she R.I.P!.

Philo Beddoe i cant believe what everyone is saying about this young girl.i was at the hospital on saturday when she was bought in and without knowing at the time what had happened,the look on the girls family nd friends is something which i will never forget.to me and everyone else we should just think that she is just a child and having a child of that age myself know that they can be vulnerable to anything makes it that must more worse and upsetting.
