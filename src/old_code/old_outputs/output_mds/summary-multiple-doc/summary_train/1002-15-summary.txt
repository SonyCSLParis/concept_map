"While scientists were pretty dismissive of any risk years ago, with the accumulation of studies, it appears people who have been using their phones for a long period of time are at greater risk of certain kinds of brain tumours. "The state of the science is that there are no health effects," said Marc Choma, a spokesperson for the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, adding that if parents "wish to take a precautionary approach to cellphone use by their children, that's their decision." "I would also suggest that cordless telephones and Wi-Fi and wireless games should be included in their recommendations for avoidance by children, and that these devices should not be used in close proximity to children," he said.
