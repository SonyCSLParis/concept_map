~ - Anonymous Chorister , 10th Grade, 9th year with the SVCC "I really love to sing, and performing with SVCC provides a way for me to make people smile! With the help of the tuition assistance program I am able to watch my child learn and grow. I have been in choir for the past three years, and have received tuition assistance/scholarships every year.
