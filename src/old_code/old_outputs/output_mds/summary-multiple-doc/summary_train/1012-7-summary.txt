Further, Koehler and company also cited earlier studies which also supported their findings, including that of Stough (1992) who said that, "it would appear that few homeschooled children are socially deprived, and that there may be sufficient evidence to indicate that some homeschooled children have a higher self concept than conventionally schooled children " (as cited in Aiex, 1994). Now, the homeschooling philosophy is quite different from traditional schooling, it's more about learning life skills and to go into something that you're interested in, and not merely take up say, hard Science subjects just for the mere goal of taking it. And that homeschooling is a an alternative to traditional schooling.
