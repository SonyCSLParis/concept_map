Critique of Anti-Spanking Study This is a critique of the study by Straus, Sugarman, and Giles-Sims (1997) Spanking by Parents and Subsequent Antisocial Behavior of Children in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, and its implications for the broader topics of nonabusive spanking and parental discipline by Robert E. Larzelere. THE GOOD NEWS (for anti-spanking advocates): This is the first study that finds any detrimental child outcome of nonabusive or customary physical punishment by parents using a design that would not also tend to find detrimental outcomes of most alternative discipline responses (or, for that matter, a wide variety of other interventions, including marital therapy, psychotherapy, or cancer treatment). The Straus et al. study is the first to correct for that problem and find any detrimental effect on children.
