But then it should also stand to reason that, with a risk factor (using data from two of the studies discussed, below) of developing brain tumors from cellphone exposure ranging from a factor of 3.9 to 8.19, the connection between harm and cellphone use would also be accepted knowledge. This study found not only an increased risk for acoustic neuroma, but also an increasing risk of acoustic neuromas with each additional year of cellphone use. Table 7, Risk of Acoustic Neuroma by Duration of Cellphone Use AN Odds Ratio Calculated p-value Duration of Use 45 cases 1-4 years 23 cases 5 years 19 cases 5-9 years 17 cases 10 years 2 cases Not reported Phone type not known, 5 cases Not reported Analog cellphone, 4 cases Not reported Digital cellphone, 36 cases < 167.5 hours 25 cases 167.5 to 654 hours 12 cases 654 hours 8 cases 5 years but < 81.7 hours 10 cases 5 years and > 81.7 hours 9 cases It is interesting to consider again that only 2 cases in this study used a cellphone for 10 years or more as we juxtapose it with the next report (Study 9) that found an acoustic neuroma risk with 12 cases of over 10 years of cellphone exposure.
