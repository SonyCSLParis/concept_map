The Pot and Driving Campaign The information presented here dates from a CPHA project on Pot and Driving concluded in 2006. On November 21, 2005, the Canadian Public Health Association, with funding from Canada's Drug Strategy, Health Canada, launched the Pot and Driving campaign to raise awareness among young Canadian drivers, 14-18 years-of-age, and their passengers of the risks of cannabis-impaired driving. The safety of passengers was an expressed concern, with comments such as, "Because they're smoking up, there can be very serious consequences because there are a lot of passengers" and "If you were a passenger you wouldn't want to know that your pilots were rolling a joint."
