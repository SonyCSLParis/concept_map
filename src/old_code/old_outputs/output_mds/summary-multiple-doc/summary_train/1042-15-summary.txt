Moved by our conviction that public schools benefit all the children in our society, and that they are a salient mark of our sense of ourselves as a part of God's diverse, multi-cultural and multi-racial family, we repeat the 1963 call of the National Council of the Churches of Christ for "efforts to strengthen and improve the American system of public education." We therefore call upon the member denominations of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, working with others in communities of faith and concern, to: encourage local churches to form committees to learn about public school issues, to offer candidate forums during school board elections, and to educate their members about the historical role of churches in creating and supporting public schools; support programs to increase and equalize state and local funding and support, to end the present unjust educational disparities between rich and poor; insist upon excellence in teaching in the public schools by calling for strengthened teacher training in both church-related and public institutions, for enhanced professional development for teachers and administrators, and for policies which assign teachers only to disciplines in which they are fully prepared, to classes whose size encourages individualized assistance, and to schedules which give teachers time to prepare or consult with other teachers, students, and parents; support standards-based school reforms, working in districts and states until the country as a whole has reasonable and challenging standards by which to assess students and schools; encourage the development of smaller schools (including "schools within schools") to provide a caring environment; call upon the Congress to pass and fund fully legislation to repair and modernize school facilities and to create new facilities as needed; and advocate for universal, early, and quality preschool education for all children. We call on communities of faith to bring their resources, public concern, and moral authority to support not only the public schools, but also the teachers, the administrators, and, most particularly, the children in those schools.
