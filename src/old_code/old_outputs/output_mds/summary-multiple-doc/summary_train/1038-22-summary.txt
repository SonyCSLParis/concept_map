Before you send your child off to school, take a moment to consider whether or not he or she is ready for college. Or, she just might not be sure what she wants to study. Sit down with your child or with a counselor, and brainstorm some ideas together that will be enriching and help prepare for college, whether it's coming up in a few months, or a year from now.
