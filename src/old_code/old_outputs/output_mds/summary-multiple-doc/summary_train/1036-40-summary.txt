So primarily our effort was education, I should say three things that you looked at: one was education; the other, support for parents who need it (because many of the parents might be hesitant or they don't have the confidence to go up and ask the teacher what's going on, they might just be shy or not have the time, and so generally to provide support); and the third is kind of celebration, how do we all have fun together and get to know a little bit more about each other. Sambhavi Lakshminarayanan : I found that in the schools, for minority parents, which, you might say, [inaudible] to look at, specifically they showed in the minorities, there is a kind of shyness and a tendency to kind of be in the background, an attitude of  we don't want to rock the boat   so long as the children are [inaudible], we don't want to do anything. I think that really I do feel strongly that it is the parents' responsibility not only to know what your children are doing in the classroom to see whether they are doing their homework or not but because our children spend a majority of their time within the school, so school plays such an important role in their development that if we don't know what are the influences then we are really lost.
