Students must choose if they want to fund their education with a Graduate PLUS loan OR a private (alternative) loan to cover their cost of attendance NOT covered with federal Stafford and/or Perkins loans. Private Loans Private educational loans are available from private lenders for students whose cost of attendance has not been met through other federal loans or if a student is not eligible for federal student loans. Students that are eligible for federal loans can receive an additional $908 in federal loans, most likely Federal Graduate PLUS loans, to offset these fees.
