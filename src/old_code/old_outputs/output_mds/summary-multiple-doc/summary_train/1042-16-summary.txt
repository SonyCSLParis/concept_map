Religious Education Loses Out in Ethics Trial Catholic Communications, Sydney Archdiocese, 18 Mar 2010 A pilot program introducing ethics classes at 10 different NSW public primary schools as an alternative to the current 30 minute weekly religious education classes begins next month. Under the 1990 NSW Education Act, General Religious Education as well as Special Religious Education is mandated as part of the weekly public school curriculum. Worth noting, also, is the fact that if the NSW Government intends to add ethics courses as part of a state-wide syllabus once the trial is over, it will also have to change the law and the current Education Act, which only makes provision for general religious and special religious classes.
