You and your child(ren) will have a great opportunity to spend the morning engaging in a few of the winter science activities KinderCare will offer during its  annual camp. Potty Tots are helping children around the world with potty training and now we have another place on the world wide web to share potty training tips as well as advice on all things toddler! We even have a page "Just for Tots" where your little one can meet the Potty Tots and play games with them!
