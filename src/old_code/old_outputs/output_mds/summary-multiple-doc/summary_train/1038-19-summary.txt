Kindergarten readiness: Is your child ready for school? Many schools still use these dates to determine who is ready for school, but research shows that your child's chronological age isn't the best way to decide whether he has what it takes to be a successful kindergartner. If you wish, you can discuss them with the head of your child's preschool or the principal of the elementary school your child will be attending to see if these professionals recommend that your child begin kindergarten next year.
