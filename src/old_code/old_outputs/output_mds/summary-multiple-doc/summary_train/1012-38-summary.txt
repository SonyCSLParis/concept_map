She told the older boy, Adam (there was an older son Daniel but we didn't find out about that until the end of the show), who looked about 14 or 15 (I never heard his age), that the worldly people wanted to take the boys away from her and put them in a foster home after the younger boy, Jacob, had been found eating from garbage cans. She had told them stories like this for years, and they were afraid of foster homes. However much we may rail against the forces of a government that we believe is taking away our rights as individuals or as a community of believers, we are yet forced to concede that they have done, and likely will do yet, more good in bringing people together than we can dream of accomplishing.
