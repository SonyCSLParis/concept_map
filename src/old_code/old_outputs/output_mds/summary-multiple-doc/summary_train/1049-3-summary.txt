I don't think I embrace Waldorf 100%, and I know I don't even embrace Montessori 60% but I love ideas from both and would probably enjoy a school that also employed my a little of this, a little of that approach. I would consider it, but as it is I live around 45 minutes from the only Waldorf school in the area. I have found that the impression people get from looking in on a Waldorf school is different from actually being in the community.
