Once you've decided what you have a phobia about (and it should be fairly easy to determine) you can begin to set up your hypnosis routine that will reduce the effect that your phobia has on you, or even get rid of it altogether. The other thing to consider about hypnosis and phobias is that when you're dealing with such an ingrained idea as a phobia, it will often take more than just a few days to get rid of the phobia. Fear of dentists is quite common and hypnosis can be used to help overcome it.
