General shyness, social phobias, and other types of anxiety phobias and panic disorders can all result in public speaking phobias. The good news is that even if you have memories of being severely criticised, or even humiliated at school or college, or while speaking in public as an adult in front of a group of people, it wasn't the event that caused the phobia but the way your brain responded to it. But when they discover how easy overcoming fear of public speaking phobia actually is they wish they'd done it years ago.
