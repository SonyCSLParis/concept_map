Teens oblivious to Anti-smoking ads But campaigns may be helping other Canadians to quit Whenever public officials try to justify the more than $50 million a year the Canadian government spends on advertising, the first ads they point to are those aimed at getting teenagers to stop smoking. So what may be happening is that all those ads trying to convince teenagers that smoking is not cool, have contributed to spreading that attitude among adults. Many Canadian adults are therefor likely to get much of their information about how teens are acting, and what they think is cool, from television.
