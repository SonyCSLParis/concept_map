More involvement is better, but you don't have to be president of the PTO or run the school carnival. Kids develop better social skills and show improved behavior when their parents are involved at school. When parents become involved in their children's education, they become more comfortable in the school building, gain confidence in their parenting skills, and feel more capable of helping their children learn.
