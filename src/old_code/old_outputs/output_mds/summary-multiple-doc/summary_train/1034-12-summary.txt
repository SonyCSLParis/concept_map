As parents, you have the right to allocate (or ration) the amount of time your youth can spend on television, recreation and socializing, as opposed to household chores or homework. Unless you are on a high-speed modem, your telephone line is tied up when the computer is on-line, so the same house rules about phone use may have to apply to the computer. I have two adult children in my home, and also a computer.
