About half of 10th-graders said they had used alcohol over the previous 12 months; about one in 4 (28%) reported marijuana use... More than half of the parents polled in the latest survey believed general alcohol use amongteens -- other than their children -- was higher than reflected in the earlier poll and about a third overestimated marijuana use among other teens. Among the major findings: 10% of the parents believed their teen had used alcohol within the past year; 15% reported that they were not sure about their child's alcohol use. Just 3% of parents with 13- and 14-year-olds believed their child might be using the substances.
