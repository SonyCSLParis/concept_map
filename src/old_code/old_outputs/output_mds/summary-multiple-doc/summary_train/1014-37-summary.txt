Photo / Thinkstock Smoking has become unaffordable and uncool for many teenagers, according to a new survey which shows the habit declining among the young. The tax on cigarettes has increased by about 30 per cent over the last 18 months, and I think that's had a huge impact because young smokers are especially sensitive to how much cigarettes cost." The environment in which these young people are growing up and the way in which they are being exposed to tobacco and the risk factors around smoking is also undergoing a change, and I think that's influence which is trickling down to their behaviour.
