Yes Madam In teacher Urmila Jaisi's classroom in robot-like discipline has been replaced by group work, creativity and many more smiling children. I've learned that all activities should be centered on the active participation of the children and I am no stranger to organising group work anymore,  she says. Whether or not it is due to the closer and more relaxed relationship between the children and their teacher she does not know, but Urmila Jaisi do feel that the children in her class are smiling and laughing a lot more than a year ago, before her training.
