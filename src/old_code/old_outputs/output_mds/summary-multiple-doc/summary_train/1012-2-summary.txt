Susan Http://www.homeschoolinginthekitchen.blogspot.com i found the part you're at, with all of the questions, the hardest thing about getting started homeschooling *grin* there are several options for homeschooling in oakland (& only going through ousd itself would require the amount of meetings you mentioned) hickman charter school is an option http://www.hickman.k12.ca.us/charter.php (they have several ''activity days''/open houses throughout the year, always on wednesdays from about 10am-1pm at live oak park in north berkeley ~ that's the best way to get a feel for them & you can meet lots of other families) in the state of california, you have to reside either in the county a charter school is located in or a neighboring county, other charter schools available are listed here http://www.homefires.com/support/alameda.asp there are several different homeschool groups that offer various activities & support, most are listed here http://www.homefires.com/support/alameda.asp *lots* of families homeschool with children of different ages, visiting some of the groups listed above will likely really help wildcat community freeschool is a homeschool-friendly program with intimate, mixed age classes offered 3, 4 & 5 days a week ~ many families carpool from oakland. s My daughter (who will be 11 in September) and I are also looking for homeschooling groups, and we would love to talk with you. I suggest you check out a homeschool group (or several) in your area and see if you like what you see.
