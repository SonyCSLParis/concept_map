The authors recommend that more parts of the country ban smoking while there's any kids in the car. In the survey they did of middle school and high school students, close to one thirds of them said that in the past week they have been driven in a car in which someone was smoking. Even for smokers' own health, it's really important for them to realize that they should not smoke in such a small, confined space," Navas-Acien told Reuters who wasn't involved in the new study.
