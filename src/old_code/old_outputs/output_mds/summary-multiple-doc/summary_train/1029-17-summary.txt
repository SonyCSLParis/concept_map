Where the views of parents seem to be in total opposition (eg tough vs soft approach), it may even be necessary to ask parents to agree on a trial of one or the other approach for a period and then to review what worked and what didn't. Parents may be encouraged to use reflective listening if they understand that this will help the young person take responsibility for their actions. These cases in particular, require five primary goals for case management: Survival and improved safety of the young person Support of the parent(s)/care-giver(s) and other family members of the young person Safety of others who may be the victims of chaotic and abusive behaviour Identification of not only the problems of the case, but also the strengths/ resources used and successes achieved Worker survival through the effective use of the supervisory process and other strategies Multiple services and interventions may be required.
