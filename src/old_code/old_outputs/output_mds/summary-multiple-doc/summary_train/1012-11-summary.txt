There is no free lunch -- when you take public school money for homeschooling, you are agreeing to allow the state be the head of your children's education. Why not be openly Christian in all you do in your homeschooling? The good news is that we have found that most Christian parents who homeschool will NOT go into public school homeschooling IF they are educated on the biblical reasons not to before they get into it.
