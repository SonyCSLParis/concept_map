During the elementary school years (grades 1-8) the students have a class (or "main lesson") teacher who stays with the same class for (ideally) the entire eight years of elementary school. There are no "textbooks" as such in the first through fifth grades. The four seasonal festivals are Michaelmas (fall), Christmas (winter), Easter (spring), and St. John (summer).
