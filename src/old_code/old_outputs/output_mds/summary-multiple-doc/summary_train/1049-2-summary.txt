At the time, I didn't understand that the foundation year was not only a pre-requisite to teacher training but also essential to it. Now after all my years of teacher training, studying Rudolf Steiner, and teaching in a Waldorf school, I can tell you that there are so many deep layers to Waldorf education that cannot be grasped in a nutshell. I do have a copy or two of "You are Your Child's First Teacher" and while that was very influential in my choice of Waldorf Education in the first place, I may have been my child's First Teacher, but their Waldorf Teachers were pretty adamant that they were better suited than I to complete the task.
