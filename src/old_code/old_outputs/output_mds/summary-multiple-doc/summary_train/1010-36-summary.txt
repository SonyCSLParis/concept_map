However, in the Vaughn decision, the judge found that parents, if brought into court on truancy charges, must introduce evidence that their children are receiving "equivalent instruction" and are not truant. This is best if you are removing children from a school in which they've been enrolled, as the district will certainly notice that they've not been asked to transfer records. Since homeschoolers are not public schools, we are not required to give evidence of any number of "instructional days" or hours, nor are we required to follow or to submit a schedule.
