I'm reading a book on Steiner at the moment to try and really learn about what he was all about because I do get the impression that true anthroposophists are like a bit of a cult - I don't know - I'm hoping I'm wrong..... Have a few of Steiner's books but they are so hard to get into...... Will let you know what I think about the place tomorrow - I'm so excited that I'm afraid that I'm blowing the place up so much in my head that I'm going to be disappointed..... I would say my latest personal experience with Steiner was an insensitive one - that was to do with me rather than my children and this did make me sigh as I expected better of them but all I have experienced so far for my children has been positive and very nourishing.
