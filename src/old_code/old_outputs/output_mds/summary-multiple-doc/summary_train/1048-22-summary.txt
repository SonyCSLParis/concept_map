Emotional issues that can profoundly affect toilet training include a desire for independence and self-mastery, the child's need to control some aspects of his environment, testing of limits and rules, his desire to win his parents' approval, fears associated with toilet use, and the desire to mimic or conform to other children's behavior. If he resists the idea or cries when you mention the potty, he may be experiencing conflict and you will need to wait for a more opportune time. At around eighteen months, your child is likely to become fascinated by the behavior of other children his age or a little older, and his desire to imitate them may spur him to use the toilet much earlier than he otherwise would.
