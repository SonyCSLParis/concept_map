Underlying the three approaches are variant views of the nature of young children's needs, interests, and modes of learning that lead to contrasts in the ways that teachers interact with children in the classroom, frame and structure learning experiences for children, and follow the children through observation/documentation. The ECAP/ITG Web site has an extensive Reggio link ( http://ceep.crc.uiuc.edu/poptopics/reggio/reginfo.html ), presenting information about Reggio Children/USA and a list of self-nominated schools in North America with programs based on or inspired by the approach used in Reggio Emilia. In addition, other classroom materials are created or put together by individual teachers or groups as they carefully consider their classroom observations.
