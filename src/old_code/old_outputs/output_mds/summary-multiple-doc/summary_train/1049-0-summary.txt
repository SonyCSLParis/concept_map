The above being stated as my personal convictions, I will also state my objections to the WC/PLANS tactics and approach to Waldorf Education as I understand it to have been promoted so far: In their efforts to acquire a base of support for their legal efforts against Waldorf Charter Schools, PLANS has actively sought particular statements by Rudolf Steiner and passages from published books and books of lectures that can be interpreted to make Rudolf Steiner, the philosophical movement known as Anthroposophy and by association, the Waldorf School Movement to appear to be an elitist, racist organization that promotes a narrow world view that seeks to involve people in a cult movement.
