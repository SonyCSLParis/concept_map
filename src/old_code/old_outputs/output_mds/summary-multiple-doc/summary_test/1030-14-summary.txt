Corporal Punishment in Schools The American Academy of Family Physicians is opposed to corporal punishment in schools. The AAFP defines corporal punishment in schools as the purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for disapproved behavior. Positive reinforcement has been shown to be more effective and long-lived than aversive reinforcement.
