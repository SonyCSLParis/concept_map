In the present study, we examined the social communication of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and matched peers by documenting frequency of occurrence and duration of behavioral dimensions as they were observed in classroom settings. The following general question was addressed: When social communication performance is divided into six mutually exclusive dimensions (prosocial/engaged, passive/disengaged, irrelevant, hostile/coercive, assertive, and adult seeking), do two groups of children (i.e., a group diagnosed with FASD and a group of matched, typically developing peers) demonstrate different profiles of social communication in regard to frequency of occurrence and duration (proportion and average length of time) of each dimension in a classroom setting? Classroom Performance From a Dimension Perspective: Children With FASD and TD Children The observational data from this research indicate that children diagnosed with FASD and their TD matched peers spent most of their time demonstrating prosocial/engaged behaviors, followed by irrelevant and passive/disengaged performances.
