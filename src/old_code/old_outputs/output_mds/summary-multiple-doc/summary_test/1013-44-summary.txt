The Montessori classroom is carefully designed to encourage the development of self-motivation in learning through diverse experiences that speak to the child's imagination and need to discover. At Montessori, parents are partners with teachers and the school community. Parents are encouraged to visit the school prior to enrollment to evaluate its suitability for their child.
