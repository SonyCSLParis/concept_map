The kids at Nora Stewart Early Learning Center circle up on the carpet to hear Vincent St. Omer read a story to them. To help them, Nora Stewart provides age-appropriate books donated by the Minority Men's Network and others in the community that the kids can take home for themselves and other children in their household. "There are lots of misconceptions we have that if a child is in an impoverished environment, grows up with a single parent, that child is doomed," St. Omer said.
