You are fortunate to have a bright son, but there could be an issue with one of the above areas, and it would be best to find out which one so it can be addressed. I found it very helpful when I had my son tested as it brought us to a place where we could help him for who he was with and without his diagnosis. If you decide to have a private agency do the testing, and they recommend remediation, and you want the district to provide it you will have to go through the testing again.
