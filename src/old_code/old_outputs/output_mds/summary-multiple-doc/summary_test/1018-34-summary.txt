Unfortunately, if your school is not included in our approved list, you are not eligible for a Credit Union Student Choice loan at this time. Do I and my co-borrower need to be members of SESLOC Federal Credit Union to be eligible for a Credit Union Student Choice Loan? You can apply for a loan without being a member of SESLOC, but in order to fund the loan, you will need to become a credit union member.
