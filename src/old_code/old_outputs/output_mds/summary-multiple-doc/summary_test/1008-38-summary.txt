60-1610(a)(3)(B) states: In determining the issue of child custody, residency and parenting time, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to: (i) The length of time that the child has been under the actual care and control of any person other than a parent and the circumstances relating thereto; (ii) the desires of the child's parents as to custody or residency; (iii) the desires of the child as to the child's custody or residency; (iv) the interaction and interrelationship of the child with parents, siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests; (v) the child's adjustment to the child's home, school and community; (vi) the willingness and ability of each parent to respect and appreciate the bond between the child and the other parent and to allow for a continuing relationship between the child and the other parent; (vii) evidence of spousal abuse; (viii) whether a parent is subject to the registration requirements of the Kansas offender registration act, K.S.A. In coming to decisions - and in resolving child custody matters - Kansas law mandates the use of parenting plans "defining the legal custody, residency, and parenting time to be exercised by parents," [5] the objectives of which are to: (1) Establish a proper allocation of parental rights and responsibilities; (2) establish an appropriate working relationship between the parents such that matters regarding the health, education and welfare of their child is best determined; (3) provide for the child's physical care; (4) set forth an appropriate schedule of parenting time; (5) maintain the child's emotional stability; (6) provide for the child's changing needs as the child grows and matures in a way that minimizes the need for future modifications to the permanent parenting plan; (7) minimize the child's exposure to harmful parental conflict; (8) encourage the parents, where appropriate, to meet their responsibilities to their minor children through agreements in the permanent parenting plan, rather than by relying on judicial intervention; and Deciding what is in the child's best interests is a difficult task in the best of circumstances. In handling domestic relations in general, and child custody cases specifically, however, there is often little thought given to the fact that many children - and parents - in family court have special needs and that those special needs have to be addressed by the courts and associated professionals in order to come to a successful result in the handling of the case.
