"There is a belief that cyber bullying isn't a big deal," says Justin Patchin, PhD, assistant professor of criminal justice in the department of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire. "There seems to be a group of kids who are involved with both kinds of bullying," he says, including a sub-group of children who are victimized in the school yard but are bullies on line. Parents need to know where their kids are and who they are with after school, and this is also true for the online environment.
