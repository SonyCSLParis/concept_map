It can involve methods that are: physical (hitting, pinching, kicking) psychological (standover tactics, gestures) social (exclusion from a group, rumours) sexual (verbal, nonverbal gestures, comments, touching) Bullying generally requires three people or groups in order to occur: The person/s who does the bullying The person/s who is bullied The by-stander There is now evidence that being bullied as a child can have life-long effects and can include serious psychological and physical damage to the victim. Strategies that help are: Explain how bullying works and help your child think about why they might have been targeted (it may have something to do with the way they look, or behave) Work through strategies for dealing with the bullying behaviours when they happen Role play or rehearse the strategies with your child Check that they have skills to make and keep friends (to help them become less isolated) You may need to create opportunities for them to make new friendships Reinforce that they have been brave to tell, that the adults will also deal with the problem and that they should keep talking to you about it- so that you can all make the bullying stop What if my child is "the bully"? If your child is the bystander: Explain how bullying works and help your child think about their part in condoning this (they may have been worried that they might be the next victim if they spoke up against the bully) Work through strategies for dealing with witnessing the bullying behaviours when they happen Do not support their behaviour - they also have a responsibility to stop the bullying Support the school in their stance against bullying Make some rules for your child, such as: walk away from the bullying, and inform either yourself, (you could then confidentially inform staff that the bullying is continuing) or the staff Important Message: Bullying can be stopped by school communities and parents working together.
