Talk to the PTA about starting a Facebook group and a Twitter account. But you can make a big difference by giving a little of your time to help at your kids' school, whether you go to the school field trip to supervise students or help in the classroom. If you can't volunteer during school hours, ask the teacher if there are any projects you can do at home, such as cutting, stapling, and sorting.
