Here are a few: Be part of the School Nutrition Action Group (SNAG) along with pupils, staff, caterers and other parents - If your school doesn't have one of these, you could set one up Join your child for a school lunch and meet the school catering team Offer to start a compost scheme for your school and help the children to manage it themselves Run a gardening club - If you can spare an hour each week, help the children grow vegetables or herbs in beds or containers in the school grounds or in the class room Share your experiences at a school assembly or in the classroom - whether you're a farmer, keen gardener or run a food business you'll have something to offer. Get involved with a cooking club sharing recipes and tips - if you're stuck for ideas then check out the quarterly Cook School magazine from Focus on Food Write a school newsletter - get people inspired by interviewing staff, pupils and parents or keep a photo diary of the school garden throughout the year Get involved in the Parents Teachers Association and make sure transforming food culture is high on the agenda. Together we are revolutionising school meals, reconnecting children and young people with where their food comes from, and inspiring families to grow and cook food.
