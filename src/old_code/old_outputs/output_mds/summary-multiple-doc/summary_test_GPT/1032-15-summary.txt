In particular, people suffering from examination anxiety manifest a series of negative and catastrophic thoughts, which result in the self-induced conviction of not being able to pass a test, of failing, of making a fool of themselves with respect to others, a partner and parents and losing their esteem or, more in general, of having their reputation compromised (either in true or imaginary terms). A subject suffering from severe examination anxiety may succumb to a moment of panic and may not be able to utter a single word during an oral test or may not be able to remember anything at all during a written test, regardless of how well the person may have studied or how the person had been previously evaluated. It is very important for the person suffering from examination anxiety that he/she recognise the disturbance as a part of their personality, without falling into the trap of becoming over-critical with respect to oneself and acquiring an awareness that it is possible to overcome the problem.
