Do you really think that as a parent of an autistic child I haven't thought of all the things I may or may not have done wrong? Lauren said This is nonsense.......I have two children, both with autism.....and maybe for not all cases, but for my two children their autism is hereditary......it is through their father's side of the family which has nothing to do with obesity during pregnancy(which I was not anywhere near during pregnancy), is has nothing to do with vaccines, or anything else. Deb said Okay that's a load of crap--the best shape I was in pregnancy wise was the child who has autism I have two other children who had a bigger birth weight and which I gained more weight with--they are not autistic in any way.
