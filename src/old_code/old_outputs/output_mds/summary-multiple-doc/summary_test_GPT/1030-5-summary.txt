The Board's current policy on corporal punishment as set forth in Section 4 of the Code of Student Conduct fails to comply with either North Carolina law or the due process requirements of the United States Constitution. It should also be noted that nowhere in the Code of Student Conduct, including both the Elementary School Code and the Upper School Code, is there a statement to the effect that  each "prohibited behavior" may be punished by corporal punishment   Thus, although the Board's corporal punishment policy has resulted in the administration of corporal punishment in the Union County school system, the Board's policy fails to comply with the statutory requirements set forth in Section 115C-391 (a). According to data obtained from the Union County Public Schools and published by The Enquirer-Journal , students were punished 20 times for being tardy; yet, "being tardy" is not listed by either the Elementary School Code or the Upper School Code as a "prohibited behavior" or as an action that might result in corporal punishment.
