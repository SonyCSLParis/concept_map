The bad news, then, is that children of divorced families are at more risk for problems as they grow up than are children of non-divorced families. They are clearly the adults in the family, but they show respect and love for their children. Written for parents, this book provides a complete guide to helping your child on his journey through divorce, including concrete information about how to handle issues and conflicts that come up at every stage of a child's development.
