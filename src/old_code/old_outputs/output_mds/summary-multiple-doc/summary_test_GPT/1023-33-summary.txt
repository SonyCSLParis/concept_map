What is not bullying? This is what they do. So let's do some cold reading research: A bully is full of rage and anger (a product of hurt) and feels the need to humiliate others Something in their life is hurting them and humiliating them The bully is scared of what is hurting them, and is not strong enough to face it, so they redirect their anger/hurt to someone else Essentially, someone else is bullying your bully and the bully is doing their best to hide it and they are worrying that they are not hiding it enough Although they are acting tough, they are just one simple step away from total breakdown A bully wishes someone knew their secret so they didn't have to hold it inside all of the time Some of the potential reasons for the bully's anger: They are being sexually abused by their father, or the sexual abuse has stopped and is now directed at a younger sister or family friend, and now they are strangely jealous or hurt Their parents are getting a divorce, possibly because the father is having an affair with a younger female They have a hidden eating disorder They cannot afford the clothing they wear, and steal it from shops or from other people's clothes lines The father has disappeared and has not come home, possibly because they are having an affair The family is going through bankruptcy but is still very materialistic and acts like it is not happening The mother has cancer, possibly breast cancer or ovarian cancer The bully's older sibling has been kicked out of home for drug use The bully's father is no longer seeing him/her every two weeks and has become unreliable Whatever is happening, you can be sure that the bully is blaming him/herself, because that's what teenagers do.
