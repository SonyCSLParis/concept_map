As an educated professional, I was not concerned about my child's academic preparation for kindergarten, and believe that in preschool it is more important for children to learn social and emotional skills. Montessori Mom I am looking for a culturally diverse montessori school for my 2 year old twins. Is there a particular Montessori school in either Oakland or Berkeley that you would recommend?
