 uranium-235 essential fissionable component postulate bomb separate natural companion abundant uranium-238 chemical mean atom respective isotope separate physical mean 
 physical method intensively explore choose electromagnetic process develop university california berkeley ernest orlando lawrence diffusion process develop urey columbia university 
 process particularly diffusion method require large complex facility huge amount electric power produce small amount separate uranium-235 
 philip hauge abelson develop method call thermal diffusion time effect preliminary separation 
 method production square mile square km tract near knoxville tennessee originally know clinton engineer works later oak ridge 
 method available production fissionable material plutonium-239 
 develop metallurgical laboratory university chicago direction arthur holly compton involve transmutation reactor pile uranium-238 
 december fermi finally succeed produce control fission chain reaction reactor pile chicago 
 quantity production plutonium-239 require construction reactor great size power release 25,000 kilowatt hour heat gram plutonium produce

 work design functioning bomb largely theoretical base fundamental experiment carry number different location 
 year laboratory direct j. robert oppenheimer create isolated mesa los alamos new mexico mile km north santa fe 
 laboratory develop method reduce fissionable product production plant pure metal fabricate metal require shape 
 method rapidly bring amount fissionable material achieve supercritical mass nuclear explosion devise actual construction deliverable weapon drop plane fuse detonate proper moment air target 
 problem solve appreciable fissionable material produce adequate amount fighting minimum delay 
 summer amount plutonium-239 sufficient produce nuclear explosion available hanford works weapon development design sufficiently far advanced actual field test nuclear explosive schedule 
 test simple affair 
 elaborate complex equipment assemble complete diagnosis success failure
