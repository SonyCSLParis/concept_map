ex parte crow dogin 1883 the u.s. supreme court rendered a decision in ex parte crow dog that reaffirmed a basic promise of federal law as it dealt with the native american nations that these nations are political sovereigns and have a right to be ruled by their own law in their own land
within three years the same court would break that promise just as the political branches of the government had broken treaties
nevertheless ex parte crow dog remains a foundational case for the tradition of legal pluralism that is today manifested in the laws and institutions of native american sovereigns
on the afternoon of august 5 1881 kangi sunka crow dog shot and killed sinte gleska spotted tail on a road in the rosebud indian agency on the great sioux reservation in dakota territory
both men were respected among the brule lakota
at the time of his death spotted tail was attempting to maintain a homeland for his people as both a traditional chief and a leader recognized by the bureau of indian affairs bia
crow dog had ridden with crazy horse yet also served several terms as a bia appointed chief of brule police
the complex forces of culture and politics that pitted these two men as enemies remain a mystery
the facts of their encounter are still disputed was it assassination or self defense
after the death of spotted tail the tribal council met and following brulé law sent peacemakers to both families to restore harmony and order
the families agreed to a payment of $ 600 and gifts of eight horses and one blanket which were quickly delivered to spotted tail 's people
nevertheless in contravention of prior policy that had honored native american self government henry lelar the acting agent at rosebud ordered the arrest of crow dog
he was quickly arrested and imprisoned at fort niobrara nebraska
crow dog 's trial in federal court dakota territory was tainted by strong anti indian prejudice
the lead prosecution witness agent john cook was in chicago when the killing occurred but he testified to crow dog 's political animosity
crow dog ably represented by attorney a. j. plowman was allowed to present his claim of self defense but pretty camp his wife and an eyewitness was not allowed to testify
moreover there is unsettling evidence of perjury
but all of this factual controversy is beside the point
the claim of federal jurisdiction the legal power to make and apply law for indian to indian matters within indian country is the crux of the matter and the conviction and death sentence given crow dog brought the issue to the supreme court
by writ of habeas corpus crow dog urged the supreme court to deny federal jurisdiction in the matter
at the same time the bia and the prosecution which had orchestrated the arrest and trial as part of a plan conceived as early as 1874 to extend federal law into indian country argued that treaties and statutes provided federal jurisdiction
the federal government made the following argument section 5339 of the revised statutes provides for the death penalty for any murder within the jurisdiction of the united states title 28 extends the general law of the united states to indian country but it has an exception for crimes committed by one indian against another indian that exception was repealed by the treaty of fort laramie 1868 which provided that bad men among the indians shall be delivered to the united states and the act of 1877 congress had prohibited further treaty making with native americans in 1871 provides that congress shall secure to the sioux nations an orderly government
and they shall be subject to the laws of the united states
 the supreme court rejected the government 's argument stating that such an understanding would reverse an unbroken policy of respect for native american sovereignty
first if bad men were not delivered the treaty called for deductions from annuities due the lakotas thus it could not mean bad men who acted against other sioux
second the statutory promise of orderly government meant a pledge of self government for the sioux
finally to be subject to the laws of the united states meant subject to the power of congress to make federal indian law for distribution of sovereignty between native americans and the united states not subject as individuals to the generality of federal law
crow dog was granted his release
crow dog returned to the rosebud agency
he remained a leader among the brulé taking ghost dancers into the badlands in 1890 and refusing an allotment until 1910
the bia repeatedly sought his removal from the rosebud agency
he died there in 1912
yet ex parte crow dog was tainted by racism
its concluding language referred to native americans living a savage life and having a savage nature and it described native american law as the red man 's revenge
 this played into the hands of the interior department and the bia which had since the late 1870s urged congress to pass a statute extending federal law to indian on indian crimes within indian country
two years after ex parte crow dog congress passed the major crimes act of 1885
the act cut deeply into the promises of self government and sovereignty by creating federal jurisdiction over seven enumerated crimes when committed by one indian against another indian
today the statute covers fourteen crimes
a year later in united states v. kagama 1886 the supreme court upheld the legality of the act
the court found a duty of protection arising from the weakness and helplessness of the native americans that granted congress power despite the lack of any constitutional authority
civilization was brought to indian country in the form of punishment retribution violence and isolation of wrongdoers
the plenary power of congress over native american affairs was affirmed and the people witnessed again the fragile nature of legal promises
