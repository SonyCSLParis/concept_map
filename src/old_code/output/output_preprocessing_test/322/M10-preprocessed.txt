custer attacked a large hunting camp of sioux cheyenne and arapahoin the little big horn valley
the indians responded by killing custer and most of his regiment
in response the federal government spent the next two years tracking down the lakota killing some and forcing most onto the reservation
in 1877 congress passed a law taking the black hills and ending sioux rights outside the great sioux reservation
the sioux land 134 million acres guaranteed by treaty in 1868 was reduced to less than 15 million acres
1877 nez perce war
this war occurred when the us army responded to some american deaths along the salmon river said to have been committed by the nez perce

they were caught 30 miles south of the canadian border
survivors were sent to indian territory in oklahoma despite the promise of the us government to allow them to return to their homeland
1879 carlisle indian school
this first off reservation military style boarding school for indians was established in pennsylvania
the school employees created a model curriculum disciplinary regime and educational strategy designed to kill the indian and save the child
 1880 civilization regulations

1883 ex parte crow dog supreme court decision
crow dog a sioux indian who shot an killed an indian on the rosebud reservation was prosecuted in federal court found guilty and sentenced to death
on appeal it was argued that the federal government 's prosecution had infringed upon tribal sovereignty
the court ruled that the us did not have jurisdiction and that crow dog must be released
the decision was a reaffirmation of tribal sovereignty and led to the passage of the 1885 major crimes act below which identified seven major crimes that if committed by an indian on indian land were placed within federal jurisdiction
1883 courts of indian offenses
the secretary of the interior established these courts to uphold the 1880 civilization regulations to eliminate heathenish practices among the indians

the list was eventually expanded to include 14 crimes
1886 united states v. kagama supreme court decision
two indians on the hoopa valley reservation in northern california killed another indian on the reservation
they were prosecuted and found guilty by the federal government
the indians argued that congress did not have constitutional authority to pass the major crimes act 1885
the court however upheld the full and absolute plenary power of the congress to pass the major crimes act and of the federal government not state governments exclusively to deal with indian tribes
these indian tribes are the wards of the nation
they are communities dependent on the united states dependent largely for their daily food dependent for their political rights
they owe no allegiance to the states and receive from them no protection
because of the local ill feeling the people of the states where they are found are often their deadliest enemies
from their very weakness and helplessness so largely due to the course of dealing of the federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised there arises the duty of protection and with it the power
 thus the case challenged the major crime act and its ruling upheld it by implying that because indian tribes were wards of the us congress had the power to regulate tribes even if it interfered with their sovereign power to deal with criminal offenders on tribal lands
1887 general allotment act dawes act
this congressional act authorized the president to allot portions of certain reservation land to individual indians 160 acres to each head of family and 80 acres to others to establish private farms and authorized the secretary of interior to negotiate with the tribes for purchasing excess lands for non indian settlement
indians were to select their own lands but if they failed to do so the indian agent would select land for them
the federal government was to hold title to the land in trust for 25 years thus preventing its sale until allottees could learn to treat it as real estate
allotment primarily sought to destroy indian communities where property sharing encouraged tribalism and to open indian lands for non indian purchase and settlement
the result was that from 1887 to 1934 when the act was repealed indian land holdings decreased from 138 million acres to 48 million
the cherokees creeks choctaws chickasaws and seminoles were excluded from the provisions of the allotment act 1888

 its followers believed that practicing ritual dance would bring back dead loved ones and restore the land to native peoples
ghost dancers also believed that clothing worn in the dance would protect them from bullets or other forms of attack
1890 wounded knee
this battle occurred shortly after non indians in south dakota became alarmed by reports of indians performing the ghost dance

1903 lone wolf v. hickcock supreme court decision
the kiowas and comanches sued the secretary of the interior to stop the transfer of their lands without consent of tribal members which violated the promises made in the 1867 treaty of medicine lodge
the court ruled that the trust relationship served as a source of power for congress to take action on tribal land held under the terms of a treaty
thus congress could by statute abrogate the provisions of an indian treaty
further congress had a plenary or absolute power over tribal relations
1906 antiquities act
this congressional act declared that indian bones and objects found on federal land were the property of the united states
1906 burke act
this act amended the dawes act to give the secretary of the interior the power to remove allotments from trust before the time set by the dawes act by declaring that the holders had adopted the habits of civilized life

1907 state of oklahoma
congress established the state of oklahoma by merging oklahoma territory and indian territory
the former indian territory was opened to additional non indian settlement 1908 -winters v. united states supreme court decision
indians from the fort belknap reservation in montana sued to prevent a white settler from damming the milk river and diverting water from their reservation
the court found that when congress created reservations it did so with the implicit intention that indians should have enough water to live
thus indians had federally reserved and protected water rights
1910 act to provide for determining the heirs of deceased indians and other purposes
this act altered the dawes act by dealing with inheritance and leasing of allotments and with the allotment of land that could be used for irrigated farming among many other things
1911 society of american indians
the society the first step in the direction of pan indian unity was established and managed exclusively by american indians most of whom were well known in non indian society and well educated
although members favored assimilation they also lobbied for many reform issues especially improved health care on reservations citizenship and a special court of claims for indians 1913 us v. sandoval
supreme court decision
the court upheld the application of a federal liquor control law to the new mexico pueblos even though pueblo lands had never been designated by the federal government as reservation land
the court ruled that an unbroken line of federal legislative executive and judicial actions had attributed to the united states as a superior and civilized nation the power and duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent indian communities within its borders
thus once congress had begun to act in a guardian role toward the tribes it was up to congress not the courts to determine when the state of wardship should end
1917 world war i.
when the us entered the war about 17,000 indians served in the armed forces
some indians however specifically resisted the draft because they were not citizens and could not vote or because they felt it would be an infringement of their tribal sovereignty

this indian church was organized in oklahoma to combine an ancient indian practice the use of peyote with christian beliefs of morality and self respect

today the church continues to play an important role in the lives of many indian people
