to get credit for this cache you must take a photograph of cloud gate aka the bean with your reflection in the picture
your face must be clear enough to identify that it is you
it took me two tries to get a picture so that my face was n't hidden by the camera so be sure to think about your face and your camera and for artistic reasons think about what else is in the reflection
you might want to pick a specific building or sculpture to be in the picture with you or you might prefer to have someone or something else in the picture with you
just make sure it 's a reflection of you off the mirrored surface of cloud gate and oddly enough if it 's your backside in the reflection and you are in the foreground that does meet the requirements
