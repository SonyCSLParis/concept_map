chicago 's cloud gate the bean there done that debate by caroline eagles september 1 2015 at 1:08 pmi love the bean in millennium park
it 's shiny and chubby and makes people smile
but i can understand if as an artist you go to all that work and thought and first of all people do n't call it by its real name and then a very similar version bubbles up in china you might not be on cloud gate nine cloud gate 's artist anish kapoor is reportedly considering legal action against the chinese oil town of karamay for its big shiny sculpture of the local liquid black stuff
with all this talk of copyright issues i 've compiled my own check list to ascertain whether the bubble if a copy at least has been done right
does the bubble have a navel or to be exact does it have an omphalos the correct greek term for cloud gate 's beanie button which creates those marvellous hall of mirrors effects
from what i can see the bubble only has an underbelly covered in brightly coloured leds
for those who think the leds are cool we also have them little elongated distortions of ourselves
2 is it built to last 1,000 years
the bean is it 's written in its contract
they were obviously taking this millennium park thing seriously
3 does it have its own song
you can hear cloud gate 's fanfare written by orbert davis below
it 's got a little mission impossible thing going to my ear
probably felt like that during the construction process
ca n't have been easy bending shaping and welding together 168 stainless steel plates and then sanding the seams down to give the bean 's smooth as a baby's bottom look
4 is it built where it was originally meant to be
the bean is n't it was supposed to be the centerpiece of the nearby lurie garden
but the planners decided the gardens would end up being trampled so it proudly sits on what is now called at&t plaza
at&t must love the idea of a 1,000 year contract
hope it does n't catch on
5 is it a heavy weight
and i 'm not talking artistically
the bean is not exactly as light as a cloud at 110 short tons
which did n't mean much to me until i worked out that 's the equivalent of 10 very large killer whales
6 is it graffiti free
because not even the artist 's signature can be found on the bean
a few have tried to etch their names into eternity or at least 1,000 years
but any attempts to beat the sands of time have been beaten by the sanders
7 will it have a regular bathing schedule
apart from daily wipe downs to keep that smooth as a baby 's bottom a clean one the bean also gets a semi annual bath in 40 gallons of tide detergent
so lots of bubbles around the bean let 's hope they 're not oily ones or the chinese will be talking about copyright issues
8 does it have a secret office inside
the bean does apparently the former office of its general foreman during the construction process
you can see it here

and finally is the bubble cool enough for a potential presidential candidate to stare into
