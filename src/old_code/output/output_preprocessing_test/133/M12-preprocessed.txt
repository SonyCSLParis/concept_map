january 23 2015chicago ’s cloud gatechicago is a city full of surprises
often people visit without knowing what to expect and yet slowly and surely find themselves falling for the charms of the windy city
as a native chicagoan i ’m not surprised our city is such a diverse and unique place that it really does have something for everyone
i ’m constantly discovering new and cool spaces in this city and am forever rewarded with novelty
chicago never stops amazing me
one of my favorite and public
spots here is the famous cloud gate aka the bean
in its short life it was constructed between 2004 and 2006
it has quickly become an well known icon and symbol for the city
early one morning soraya and i had the pleasure of having the bean to ourselves and the experience was breath taking
sometimes winter adventures really can be the most profound
the design of the cloud gate was inspired by the way mercury beads up on a flat surface
you ca n’t see any seams in the stainless steel reflection and the effect is mesmorizing
the skewed reflections give such a fresh and new perspective of the city i know so well
it just goes to show that even adventures in your hometown can lead to some very interesting experiences
being underneath the gate is my favorite part
selfie see me
twice
i could n’t believe we had the bean all to ourselves
dedication and a willingness to wake up long before a sane hour paid off big time that morning
the early bird gets the worm or in this case the bean
i always feel so small next to this sculpture
the reflection of the water on the damp ground made the most beautiful colors and patterns in the bean
it was magical watching my own reflection pass through the world reflected
i felt like alice in some glowing enchanted wonderland
