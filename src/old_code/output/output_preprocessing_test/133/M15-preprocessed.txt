the fountain consists of two 50 foot glass block towers at each end of a shallow reflecting pool
the towers project video images from a broad social spectrum of chicago citizens a reference to the traditional use of gargoyles in fountains where faces of mythological beings were sculpted with open mouths to allow water a symbol of life to flow out
plensa adapted this practice by having faces of chicago citizens projected on led screens and having water flow through an outlet in the screen to give the illusion of water spouting from their mouths
the collection of faces plensa 's tribute to chicagoans was taken from a cross section of 1,000 residents
the fountain ’s water features operate during the year between mid spring and mid fall while the images remain on view year round
