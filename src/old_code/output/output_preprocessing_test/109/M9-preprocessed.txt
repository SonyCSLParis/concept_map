stray finds have been collected and a limited amount of fieldwalking and metal detecting have taken place
sites have been identified in most parts of the parish although there are some large gaps where no sites or artefacts have been recorded
although conclusions can be drawn about past settlement and activity the large gaps mean that these can not be entirely comprehensive
prehistoric flint artefacts have been found on a few sites
although some can not be dated any more closely than the prehistoric period in general many can
these include a palaeolithic flint flake nher 6177 and two neolithic polished axeheads
archaeological investigations nher 37793 at blakeney eye have revealed neolithic and bronze age pottery along with a possible neolithic enclosure pits and post holes

six bronze age round barrows and one possible bronze age barrow survive in the south of the parish
three more were recorded during the 19th century but have since been levelled
a ring ditch next to one of the upstanding barrows may be the remains of another
two of the surviving barrows were partially excavated in the early 20th century with beaker pottery recovered from one nher 6178 and bronze age pottery discovered in the other nher 6186
together with round barrows in salthouse and kelling these features are part of one of the largest barrow cemeteries known in norfolk
a surviving barrow nher 6179 to the north is an outlier of the cemetery
this may be also true of three ring ditches possible barrows visible on aerial photographs to the south
two ring ditches to the east could be distant outliers or they may indicate a second site that was used for burials
two mounds to the east known as â€˜hammer hillâ€ ™ or hamburrow hill have been interpreted as barrows although it is more probable that they are geological features

a map from 1586 shows the building and a man with a dog and rabbits and hints that it could have been a warren lodge
