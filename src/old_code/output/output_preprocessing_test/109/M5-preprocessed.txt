blakeney point blakeney point officially called blakeney national nature reserve is a national nature reserve situated near to the villages of blakeney morston and cley next the sea on the north coast of norfolk england
its main feature is a 6.4 km 4 mi spit of shingle and sand dunes but the reserve also includes salt marshes tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland
it has been managed by the national trust since 1912 and lies within the north norfolk coast site of special scientific interest which is additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa international union for conservation of nature iucn and ramsar listings
the reserve is part of both an area of outstanding natural beauty aonb and a world biosphere reserve
the point has been studied for more than a century following pioneering ecological studies by botanist francis wall oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist emma turner
the area has a long history of human occupation ruins of a medieval monastery and blakeney chapel probably a domestic dwelling are buried in the marshes
the towns sheltered by the shingle spit were once important harbours but land reclamation schemes starting in the 17th century resulted in the silting up of the river channels
the reserve is important for breeding birds especially terns and its location makes it a major site for migrating birds in autumn
up to 500 seals may gather at the end of the spit and its sand and shingle hold a number of specialised invertebrates and plants including the edible samphire or sea asparagus
the many visitors who come to birdwatch sail or for other outdoor recreations are important to the local economy but the land based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats especially the dunes
some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat
the spit is a dynamic structure gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west
land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward
the river glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of cley village cley marshes nature reserve and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures so the river has to be realigned every few decades

1 the main spit runs roughly west to east and joins the mainland at cley beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to weybourne
it is approximately 6.4 km 4 mi long,[2 and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20 m 65 ft in width and up to 10 m 33 feet high
it has been estimated that there are 2.3 million m3 82 million ft3 of shingle in the spit,[3 97 per cent of which is derived from flint
4]the point was formed by longshore drift and this movement continues westward the spit lengthened by 132.1 m 433 ft between 1886 and 1925
5 at the western end the shingle curves south towards the mainland
this feature has developed several times over the years giving the impression from the air of a series of hooks along the south side of the spit
6 salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit,[5 and sand dunes have accumulated at the point 's western end
2 some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter
7 there is an area of reclaimed farmland known as blakeney freshes to the west of cley beach road
8][9]norfolk coast path an ancient long distance footpath cuts across the south eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes and further west at holme next the sea the trail joins peddars way
8][10
the tip of blakeney point can be reached by walking up the shingle spit from the car park at cley beach,[2 or by boats from the quay at morston
the boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface
11 the national trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay,[12 and a visitor centre on the point
the centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months
13 halfway house or the watch house is a building 2.4 km 1.5 mi from cley beach car park
originally built in the 19th century as a look out for smugglers it was used in succession as a coast guard station by the girl guides and as a holiday let
2]historyto 1912 norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the palaeolithic and has produced significant archaeological finds
both modern and neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago before the last glaciation and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards
the archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago partly because of the very cold conditions that existed then but also because the coastline was much further north than at present
as the ice retreated during the mesolithic 10,000â€“5,000 bce the sea level rose filling what is now the north sea
this brought the norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as doggerland
14][15 early mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to 15 cm 5.9 in)[16 long found on the present day coast at titchwell marsh date from a time when it was 60â€“70 km 37â€“43 mi from the sea
other flint tools have been found dating from the upper paleolithic 50,000â€“10,000 bce to the neolithic 5,000â€“2,500 bce
15]an eye is an area of higher ground in the marshes dry enough to support buildings
blakeney 's former carmelite friary founded in 1296 and dissolved in 1538 was built in such a location,[17 and several fragments of plain roof tile and pantiles dating back to the 13th century have been found near the site of its ruins
18 originally on the south side of the glaven blakeney eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries and a building known as blakeney chapel which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600 and again in the late 17th century
despite its name it is unlikely that it had a religious function
nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,[19][20 suggesting significant international trade at this time
21][22]the spit sheltered the glaven ports blakeney cley next the sea and wiveton which were important medieval harbours
blakeney sent ships to help edward i 's war efforts in 1301 and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only norfolk port between king 's lynn and great yarmouth to have customs officials
15 blakeney church has a second tower at its east end an unusual feature in a rural parish church
it has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners,[23 perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet 's sandbanks;[21 that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven including a carvel built wooden ship
15]land reclamation schemes especially those by henry calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of cley led to the silting up of the glaven shipping channel and relocation of cley 's wharf
24 further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the salthouse marshes to the east of cley
25 in an attempt to halt the decline thomas telford was consulted in 1822 but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented and by 1840 almost all of cley 's trade had been lost
24 the population stagnated and the value of all property decreased sharply
25 blakeney 's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival and in 1817 the channel to the haven was deepened to improve access
packet ships ran to hull and london from 1840 but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour
22]national trust erain the decades preceding world war i this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling locals were looking for food but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds;[26 norfolk 's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884
in 1901 the blakeney and cley wild bird protection society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its watcher bob pinchen the first of only six men up to 2012 to hold that post
27]in 1910 the owner of the point augustus cholmondeley gough calthorpe 6th baron calthorpe leased the land to university college london ucl who also purchased the old lifeboat house at the end of the spit
when the baron died later that year his heirs put blakeney point up for sale raising the possibility of development
28 in 1912 a public appeal initiated by charles rothschild and organised by ucl professor francis wall oliver and dr sidney long enabled the purchase of blakeney point from the calthorpe estate and the land was then donated to the national trust
29 ucl established a research centre at the old lifeboat house in 1913,[2 where oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of blakeney point
30 the building is still used by students and also acts as an information centre
2 despite formal protection the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s
27]the point was designated as a site of special scientific interest sssi in 1954 along with the adjacent cley marshes reserve and subsumed into the newly created 7,700 hectare 19,000 acre
north norfolk coast sssi in 1986
the larger area is now additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa and ramsar listings iucn category iv habitat species management area)[31 and is part of the norfolk coast area of outstanding natural beauty
32 the point became a national nature reserve nnr in 1994,[33 and the coast from holkham nnr to salthouse together with scolt head island became a biosphere reserve in 1976
34][35]fauna and florabirdsblakeney point has been designated as one of the most important sites in europe for nesting terns by the government 's joint nature conservation committee
36 in the early 1900s the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg taking disturbance and shooting but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid century although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000 perhaps due to predation
sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992
blakeney is the most important site in britain for both sandwich and little terns the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eight per cent of the british population
the 2,000 pairs of black headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes
other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of arctic terns and a few mediterranean gulls in the tern colony ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh
the waders breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls weasels and stoats with ringed plovers particularly affected declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously
27 the pastures contain breeding northern lapwings and species such as sedge and reed warblers and bearded tits are found in patches of common reed
8]the point juts into the sea on a north facing coast which means that migrant birds may be found in spring and autumn sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land
37][38 numbers are relatively low in spring but autumn can produce large falls such as the hundreds of european robins on 1 october 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts on 18 september 1995
the common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers great grey shrikes or richard 's pipits
seabirds may be sighted passing the point and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year
27 vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate,[39 including a fea 's or zino 's petrel in 1997 a trumpeter finch in 2008 and an alder flycatcher in 2010
ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer emma turner started ringing common terns on the point in 1909 and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since
a notable recovery was a sandwich tern killed for food in angola and a radde 's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second british record of this species at that time
27 in the winter the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck eurasian wigeon brent geese and common teal,[8 while common scoters common eiders common goldeneyes and red breasted mergansers swim offshore
40]other animalsblakeney point has a mixed colony of about 500 harbour and grey seals
the harbour seals have their young between june and august and the pups which can swim almost immediately may be seen on the mud flats
grey seals breed in winter between november and january their young can not swim until they have lost their first white coat so they are restricted to dry land for their first three or four weeks and can be viewed on the beach during this period
13 grey seals colonised a site in east norfolk in 1993 and started breeding regularly at blakeney in 2001
it is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the norfolk coast
41 seal watching boat trips run from blakeney and morston harbours giving good views without disturbing the seals
13 the corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the blakeney area between march 2009 and august 2010 each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller
42]the rabbit population can grow to a level at which their grazing and burrowing adversely affects the fragile dune vegetation
when rabbit numbers are reduced by myxomatosis the plants recover although those that are toxic to rabbits like ragwort then become less common due to increased competition from the edible species
43][44 the rabbits may be killed by carnivores such as red foxes weasels and stoats
27 records of mammals that are rare in the nnr area include red deer swimming in the haven a hedgehog and a beached sowerby 's beaked whale
45]an insect survey in september 2009 recorded 187 beetle species including two new to norfolk the rove beetle phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle leiodes ciliaris and two very rarely seen in the county the sap beetle nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle gnathoncus nanus
there were also 24 types of spider and the five ant species included the nationally rare myrmica specioides
46
the rare millipede thalassisobates littoralis a specialist of coastal shingle habitats was found here in 1972,[47 and a red veined darter appeared in 2012
48 tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded for a few days in late summer 2006 along with red eyed damselflies
49 the silver y moth also appears in large numbers in some years
50]the many inhabitants of the tidal flats include lugworms polchaete worms sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans and gastropod molluscs
these molluscs feed on the algae growing on the surface of the mud and include the tiny hydrobia an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000 mâˆ’2
bivalve molluscs include the edible common cockle although it is not harvested here
