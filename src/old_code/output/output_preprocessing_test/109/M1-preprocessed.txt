awreâ¶the parish of awre fn 1 lies 16 km
south west of gloucester between the river severn and the forest of dean
the large parish contained seven manorial estates numerous ancient farmsteads the industrial and trading village of blakeney which replaced awre village as the principal centre of population and the small but commercially significant riverside hamlet of gatcombe
the whole of awre parish was included within the jurisdiction of the forest before 1228 and apart from the hamlet of box which was disafforested in the early 14th century remained within it for as long as it had significance
fn
2)the ancient parish covered 4,520 a. 1,831 ha or 6,173 a. if all the foreshore and river within its boundaries were included
fn 3 a wide meander of the river severn forms a long boundary on the north east and south east the north west boundary mainly follows watercourses including haie brook and the south west boundary follows lanes brook
fn 4 on the west the boundary with the extraparochial forest of dean was an irregular one
from ayleford in the north it followed the hillside above the valley of soudley brook descended close to the main gloucester chepstow road near the bottom of the valley of blackpool brook at nibley crossed the lower slopes of viney hill and climbed to take in a rectangular block of land around hayes wood
fn 5
the wood was probably a late addition to the parish it owed a rent to flaxley manor in 1570 fn 6 suggesting that it was among late 13th- and early 14th century assarts whose rents were assigned to flaxley abbey in 1353
fn 7 in 1935 the block including hayes wood comprising 111 a. was transferred to west dean civil parish fn
8)
and in 1953 850 a. of east dean including blakeney hill woods blakeney hill hamlet and part of viney hill hamlet were added to awre parish
fn 9
the account given here covers the parish as constituted before 1935
low lying land in the east and centre of the parish is formed of the lower lias and red marl while an extensive level at awre point fn 10 enclosed by a loop of the severn and a smaller area further south around the sinuous inlet called brimspill or brimpspill are formed of alluvium
the lower land of the parish is bounded by an area of higher ground formed of the old red sandstone fn 11 in the north and south are gently rolling hills at around 30 60 m. which culminate in low river cliffs at box and around gatcombe while in the north west a higher ridge rises to over 106 m. before dropping to the deep valley of soudley brook near the west boundary
the land is drained principally by bideford brook which is formed at blakeney by the confluence of soudley fn 12 or forge brook and blackpool brook fn 13 and receives a number of small tributaries before flowing into the severn at brimspill
at intervals along the bank small streams reach the river by other muddy inlets known on the lower severn as pills
the scattered nature of settlement the predominance of ancient closes and the numerous small groves all suggest that most of the parish emerged from ancient woodland
hayes wood extended at 40 a. in 1570 fn 14 and 56 a. in 1839 fn 15 was the most substantial piece of woodland surviving in modern times
the smaller groves included box and phips groves on the box farm estate at the north end of the parish which each covered 8 a. in the 1730s when a local tanner held them on lease presumably as a source of bark
fn 16 only in the east around awre village was there a fully developed system of open fields and common meadows that area was inclosed in 1796
pastoral farming has predominated and orchards were once widespread
fn 17)the eastern tip of the parish is formed mainly of land reclaimed from the river severn
about 350 m. east of awre village and church the ground falls to a level which is crossed by a series of reens drainage ditches and was once farmed mainly as open fields
much of the level had presumably been gained from the river before the 12th century when the bank was perhaps on the line of a continuous hedge boundary that was once apparent between a house called hayward on the southeast and hamstalls cliff on the north west
fn 18
a sea wall described in 1846 as the main sea wall fn 19 once ran along that boundary and remains of it near the north west end survived until the early 20th century
fn 20 land called hayward evidently in the area adjoining the house fn 21 was reclaimed by the lord of awre manor c. 1140 fn 22 and probably at the same period a broad strip of land called the old warth or wharf running across awre point from near hayward towards hamstalls cliff was won from the river
fn 23
the old warth was presumably the land described as le warth ex alia parte sabrine belonging to awre manor c. 1300
fn 24 and the pasture on awre sand mentioned in 1303
fn 25 it was in regular use for pasturing cattle by 1319 fn 26 and later remained common to the tenants of the manor
by the beginning of the 17th century a further strip of land known as the new warth or wharf was emerging from the river beyond the old warth
it was evidently claimed by the tenants as an extension to the common but in 1612 they agreed that their lord sir edward winter could hold it in severalty fn 27 and two years later his tenant richard white inclosed and drained c. 30 a. by making numerous drainage furrows two cribs breakwaters and a long reen to divide it from the old warth
fn 28)the reclaimed land remained subject to flooding at very high tides fn 29 and its banks to wasting by the setting and ebbing of the tide
cribs to turn or limit the force of the tide were maintained at critical points
at the north west end of the warths there was one called hamstalls crib in the early 1720s when a second one was built beside it fn 30 and by 1732 amity crib defended the south end of the point
fn 31 by that time a shift in the main channel of the river had removed part of the new warth which was extended at only 15 a. in 1731
fn 32 some new ground which appeared in the mid 1740s was soon lost again fn 33 but before 1796 a more sustained build up of land enlarged the new warth to 49 a. fn 34 and by the 1840s a new outer sea wall had been built to defend it
fn 35 in the late 1840s much work to defend the point including the rebuilding of the cribs and the addition of new ones was carried out under the direction of william clegram of saul engineer to the gloucester and berkeley canal company
fn 36
the old warth was inclosed and absorbed into the field pattern in 1796 fn 37 but the new warth remained a notable feature of the landscape in 1989 extending for over a mile along the point
by then a further strip of land beyond its 19th century sea wall had been reclaimed and grassed over and the long reen built in 1614 on the warth 's landward side was dry and partly silted
south west of awre point where the main channel of the river generally ran close inshore fn 38 the river bank was particularly subject to erosion
the channel may have shifted from the opposite bank shortly before 1234 when land claimed by awre parish was awarded to slimbridge
fn 39 more land was probably lost in the early 17th century when part of the new grounds in slimbridge and warths in other parishes on the opposite bank were being formed fn 40 and erosion of the awre bank removed several dwellings and their home closes around woodend lane south of the village during the 18th century
fn 41 if that part of the bank was defended by a sea wall it had vanished between woodend marsh 450 m. north east of woodend lane and brimspill by the early 19th century
fn 42 during 1850 and 1851 to clegram 's plans a new wall and a series of cribs were built to protect land north east of brimspill fn 43 but near woodend lane erosion continued unchecked fn 44 and the bank there was still crumbling in the 1980s
the severn 's fisheries and the river trade were sources of income and employment in the parish
fn 45
the river 's presence was also made evident in the frequent burials of the drowned in awre churchyard in many cases victims of shipwreck or other accidents who were carried on to awre point by the currents
fn 46 vessels often foundered on the dangerous noose sandbank off the point or in the exposed waters further south
fn 47
one of the heaviest losses was in 1732 when 17 people drowned in the wreck of a newnham trow
fn 48)the main road through the parish linking gloucester and chepstow mon probably follows for most of its course a roman road leading from newnham to caerleon mon the names of stretfield hill north of blakeney and oldstreet house near the south boundary of the parish presumably derive from that ancient road
fn 49
the gloucester chepstow road was a turnpike from 1757 until 1871
fn 50 improvements carried out under the trust included a new line of road built during 1809 and 1810 to avoid gurshill in lydney beginning near awre 's south west boundary fn 51 and a new curving descent into blakeney village from the north east built during 1830 and 1831 to replace a steeper and more direct descent called swan lane
fn 52 a road down viney hill crossing the gloucester- chepstow turnpike at the south end of nibley green was by the late 18th century much used for carrying timber from the forest woods to the riverside at gatcombe and purton
that usage led the crown to pay for its upkeep for some years before 1796 when it was included in the first forest turnpike act some of the funds provided by the crown under the act being used on the road
fn 53 tollgates were sited at nibley green and at etloe house near where the road forked for gatcombe and purton
fn 54
in 1841 the forest turnpike trustees built a new road down the valley of blackpool brook to join the gloucester chepstow turnpike at nibley fn 55 where a tollgate was placed on the parish boundary near the bottom of the road
fn 56
the two roads leading down from the forest remained turnpikes until 1888
fn 57
a third route from the forest down the west side of the valley of soudley brook to blakeney fn 58 was much improved by the awre local board of health in 1889 fn 59 at the same time as the crown built the adjoining part of the road within the forest
fn 60)awre village was linked to the gloucester chepstow road by the road usually called the newnham road running to the north boundary of the parish and by another road which branched from the newnham road at cockshoot south of box farm and ran past bledisloe farm
fn 61
the latter road which in its western part was called chicknalls lane fn 62 survived only as a footpath between cockshoot and bledisloe farm in 1989
an extensive system of footpaths called church ways or burying roads which the local court leet jury was vigilant in preserving in the 18th and 19th centuries linked the many scattered farmsteads to awre church and blakeney chapel
fn 63
a footpath making the circuit of the river bank was repaired and improved as part of the severn way long distance path in the 1980s
powers for building the main south wales railway line through awre were obtained by an act of 1846 under which the gloucester and dean forest company was to build the line as far as hagloe and the south wales company to continue it southwards
in the event the whole line through the parish opened in 1851 was built by the south wales company which amalgamated with the great western railway in 1863
fn 64
the parish was served by a station at purton in lydney but called gatcombe station until 1868 when awre junction station was built beside the awre blakeney road at the junction with the new forest of dean central railway
awre junction station was closed to passengers and general freight in 1959 and to coal in 1961
