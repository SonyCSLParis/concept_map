texas revolutiontexas revolution
the texas revolution began with the battle of gonzales in october 1835 and ended with the battle of san jacinto on april 21 1836 but there were earlier clashes between official forces and groups of colonists so that it is impossible to set dogmatic limits in speaking of military episodes alone to say nothing of the development of social and political differences that were a part of the revolution
the seeds of these differences were planted in the national habits and experiences of mexican rulers and anglo american occupants of texas
misunderstanding was aggravated in the minds of mexicans by the conviction that the united states government was not above making use of the colonists to cause trouble in the hope of acquiring texas by purchase or revolution
military incidents occurred in 1826 1832 and 1835 preceding the decisive movement in the fall of 1835
in 1826 haden edwards and benjamin w. edwards in east texas attempted to inaugurate a war for independence see fredonian rebellion but were suppressed by mexican soldiers supported by militia from stephen f. austin 's colonies
a series of attacks in 1832 resulted in the withdrawal of mexican garrisons from anahuac velasco nacogdoches and tenoxtitlã¡n
in the anahuac disturbances the anglo american attack was led by john austin and was precipitated by indiscretions of the commander john juan davis bradburn
fighting was determined at velasco where col domingo de ugartechea was attempting to prevent reinforcements and artillery from sailing to anahuac and both he and the insurgents suffered severely see velasco battle of
the battle of nacogdoches resulted in the mexican garrison 's evacuation after only nominal resistance and col josã © francisco ruiz a native of san antonio abandoned fort tenoxtitlã¡n without being attacked
antonio lã³pez de santa anna was leading a revolution against president anastacio bustamante at the time of these disturbances in texas and the colonists who participated in them declared that they were cooperating with him by expelling bustamante 's garrisons from texas
actually the great mass of the colonists had no quarrel with mexico or mexicans and adopted resolutions assuring the authorities of their loyalty at least they wanted no war with mexico
tranquillity seemed about restored on this basis when a seriocomic episode occurred at the mouth of the brazos
col josã © antonio mexã­a sailed in with a regiment of santanisto soldiers and inquired what was going on
with him was stephen f. austin who had been in mexico during the summer and by austin 's advice it was decided to stand by the declaration of the insurgents for santa anna
after enjoying appropriate hospitalities mexã­a sailed away but one result of his visit was serious it had compelled austin to abandon his policy of aloofness from national party contests
the summer closed with santa anna successful in mexico and all garrisons expelled from texas except those at san antonio and goliad
the colonists held the convention of 1832 and convention of 1833 and asked for a number of privileges and reforms of which three were the most important
1 in september 1823 congress had given the colonists certain tariff exemptions for seven years
this liberal law expired in 1830 and friction over the tariff was an element in the disturbances in 1832
both conventions adopted petitions asking for extension of the tariff exemptions
2 when the federal system was instituted in 1824 congress united coahuila and texas as a single state with the somewhat indefinite assurance that the union might be dissolved when texas was qualified for statehood
both conventions declared that texas was able to maintain a state government and asked for separation
the convention of 1833 went so far as to frame a constitution for the approval of congress see constitution proposed in 1833
3 apprehension over heavy anglo american colonization led congress to pass the law of april 6 1830 forbidding immigrants to settle in territory adjacent to their native country
though this law was subsequently interpreted to permit continued settlement in the colonies of austin and green de witt it remained a menace to the development of texas and the conventions petitioned for its repeal
resolutions of the convention of 1832 were never delivered but austin elected to present the petitions of 1833 arrived in mexico city in july
in brief congress repealed the immigration restriction of the law of april 6 1830 held the tariff plea in abeyance and took no action on the petition for statehood
on his way home austin was arrested at the instigation of vice president valentã­n gã³mez farã­as and held a prisoner in mexico until july 1835
dissatisfaction over continued union with coahuilawas alleviated by state laws extending local self government and granting texas trial by jury and appellate courts
at the same time however santa anna 's movements toward overthrowing the constitution of 1824 and establishing virtual dictatorship aroused bitter opposition
details of the santa anna program included remanning the military posts evacuated in 1832 and reorganizing the state government
the first contingent of soldiers arrived at anahuac in january 1835 and some local friction soon developed
in june a mail courier brought news that federal troops had arrested the governor and that large reinforcements would soon strengthen the standing garrison at san antonio
this information led to a march against anahuac in which the volunteers were commanded by william b. travis
capt
antonio tenorio surrendered the post without a contest and superficially conditions in texas appeared to return to the status of 1832
numerous mass meetings condemned travis and adopted resolutions declaring loyalty to mexico
reports continued however that santa anna was bent upon military occupation of texas and a group of colonists published a call for election of delegates to a convention or consultation in october
austin returned from his long detention in mexico gave his approval to the consultation and was made chairman of a committee of safety and correspondence at san felipe
the committee was regarded as a central advisory board to collect and distribute information
from this time forward only a spark was necessary to set off an explosion
at copano bay gen. martã­n perfecto de cos landed at the head of 500 men formed his troops and moved on san antonio
austin 's committee called for the immediate formation of military units to offer armed resistance
cos announced his intention to punish those who led the uprising at anahuac and in his proclamation was the hint that he would drive the american settlers out of texas
the day after cos arrived in san antonio on october 9 texans seized goliad the location of a mexican constabulary on the road from copano to san antonio
at the battle of gonzales what is regarded as the first shot in the texas revolution was fired
because of growing unrest the military commandant of coahuila and texas col domingo de ugartechea whose headquarters were also in san antonio demanded of the citizens of gonzales the return of a cannon that had been presented or at the least lent to them in 1831 for defence against indians see gonzales come and take it cannon
alcalde andrew ponton not only refused the demand but also called to other texans for help
annoyed by ponton 's refusal ugartechea sent about 100 dragoons under the command of lt francisco castaã±eda to seize the cannon forcibly if necessary
originally only eighteen men constituted the gonzales defense but by october 2 the ranks had increased to about 160 volunteers
commanded by john henry moore and joseph w. e. wallace the gonzales texans stood their ground and the dragoons returned empty handed to san antonio
austin at this time in command of the newly formed texan army see revolutionary army and in the gonzales vicinity realized that texas had reached the point of no return
in early october he therefore led his command all volunteers toward san antonio
two others shared the command james bowie and james w. fannin jr.
on the night of october 27 bowie in general command staked out a solid defensive position on the san antonio river not far from nuestra seã±ora de la purã­sima concepcã­on de acuã±a mission
on the following morning in the battle of concepciã³n the texans defeated a combined force of mexican foot and horse soldiers supported by artillery with the mexicans losing sixty men to the texans one
on november 26 the texans again faced the mexicans at the grass fight
once again bowie was in command but this time with edward burleson who assumed austin 's command the latter having been made commissioner to the united states by the provisional government
the texans forced the mexicans to retreat killing fifty of them in the process while losing two men with another unaccounted for
the climax of the siege of bexar came on december 5 when learning that burleson was considering withdrawal to goliad benjamin r. milam raised the defiant cry who will go to san antonio with old ben milam and he and frank francis w.
johnson led 300 volunteers into the heart of the city
after three days of house to house fighting milam was dead and san antonio was the prize of the texans
ironically cos 's final stand was at the alamo
forced to surrender the mexican commander was compelled to take his troops beyond the rio grande
taking advantage of the fact that the texan army was divided and disintegrating after its victories in 1835 santa anna in his role as generalissimo crossed the rio grande shortly after the new year
he was on a punitive expedition conducted in much the same way as that against the zacatecans
his plan was simple and direct he would crush insurgency in texas with the force of a hammer treating all in arms against his government as mere pirates
the quelling of piracy after all required no mercy
at the beginning of his campaign it seemed apparent that he would do just that for texan fortunes took a decided turn for the worse in early 1836
by march 2 the convention of 1836 meeting at washington on the brazos formally voted for independence though in view of santa anna 's powerful force such action might have been considered premature
the convention also appointed sam houston major general of the texas army and commander of the forces at gonzales
after crossing the rio grande with 6,000 troops santa anna 's command eventually grew to more than 8,000
it soon became apparent that his target was san antonio and the texans stationed there
in point of fact he probably should have avoided that city for it was not important to his success
the texan defense stood on a triangle
on the west was san antonio on the south was san patricio and on the northeast was la bahã­a goliad
militarily speaking goliad was the prize
it held approximately 500 insurgents under the command of fannin while a divided command under bowie and william b. travis at the alamo comprised only 150 men to which only some thirty more were soon added
the door to east texas with its heavy american population goliad and presidio la bahã­a was its key
san antonio however even reinforced could not offer a real threat to santa anna or even to his line of communication
but military considerations aside the general was determined to march on san antonio in part because of the humiliation visited upon his family through defeat of his son in law cos
