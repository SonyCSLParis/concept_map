the convention of 1832 and 1833 the convention of 1832 texans settlers followed the news of the mexican civil war with great interest hoping santa anna would win because the texan settlers believed that a new federalist government would respond to their needs
on october 1 1832 a convention was held to discuss their problems
at any convention delegates or people chosen to speak for a group would discuss issues and decide a course of action
meeting at san felipe de austin these delegates chose stephen f. austin as their leader
all these delegates wanted change in texas
they demanded immigration from the u.s to continue
they also wanted texas to be a separate mexican state because at the time texas was part of a bigger state called coahuila y tejas ramon musquiz the governor of the department of texas supported these concerns
according to mexican law the convention of 1832 was not a legal meeting
because the delegates had not met legally ramon musquiz refused to send their requests to the mexican government
so the convention of 1832 failed
the convention of 1833 shortly after the convention santa anna won the civil war in mexico and became president
the federalists now held power
news of this victory in texas called to another convention
this convention took place on april 1 1833
the delegates in this convention were firmer than the first
this time they chose william h. wharton as their leader
the delegates this time asked for better mail service improved defense against the native american raids the right to use english in business and law they again demanded an end to the ban against immigration more money for better schooling and they urged that texas should be a separate mexican state
even though william h. wharton was the leader austin still took an active part in this convention
david g. burnet wrote about why the settlers wanted statehood
he noted that mexico 's founders had combined texas and coahuila into one state and that texas was to become its own state as soon as the population grew big enough
texas suffered as a part of coahuila y tejas said burnet
the state government gave few services to the towns of texas
the last part of the convention of 1833 was to draft a constitution for texas
the special task of drafting a constitution for texas was rested upon newcomer 's sam houston 's shoulders
the land of promise was what sam houston called texas
the convention 's work was soon completed
the delegates took a strong stand in favor of texas statehood
they hoped mexico city would welcome their ideas
all the convention needed now was a messenger
stephen f. austin set off for mexico city hoping to finish the business quickly but was completely unaware of the trouble awaiting him
