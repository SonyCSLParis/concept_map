colonial capital of texas during the 1820s san felipe de austin emerged as the capital of the anglo colonies in mexican texas
conventions were held there in 1832 and 1833 as colonists expressed grievances and proposed ways for the mexican government to better serve the colonies
the convention of 1832 following antagonisms throughout mexican texas was comprised of 55 delegates none of whom were tejano representing 16 districts of texas
stephen f. austin was elected president of the convention which met from october 1st through the 6th
numerous issues were addressed including requested modifications to the law of april 6 1830 which had restricted general immigration from the united states
most controversially delegates adopted a motion to request separate statehood from coahuila
for many reasons the resolutions were never presented to the mexican government
in april 1833 another convention met to consider unresolved business from 1832
austin was traveling within the mexican settlements seeking support for proposals to the government when the convention was called
william h. wharton presided over the meeting and the convention petitioned for repeal of the anti immigration section of the law of april 6 1830
the convention also passed resolutions prohibiting african slave traffic in texas
again a proposal was made to split coahuila and texas into separate mexican states
sam houston chaired a committee to draft a constitution presuming the request for separate statehood would be accepted
a committee was tasked with taking these proposals to the mexican government but only austin would make the trip
this trip into mexico would lead to his imprisonment from january 1834 until august 1835
upon his release and return to texas he galvanized the movement in support of an independent texas
the convention that met in san felipe in november 1835 debated this precise issue and decided against a declaration of independence
the group passed a â€œsolemn declarationâ€ outlining grievances that led to revolt and they also created a provisional state government
in evolving forms the government of texas ruled from san felipe for five months of the seven month long texas revolution
while the declaration of independence was adopted at convention in nearby washington on the brazos the events that led to independence largely swirled around stephen f. austinâ€ ™ s colonial headquarters at san felipe de austin see more at http://web.archive.org/web/20160519200415/http://www.thc.state.tx.us/historic-sites/san-felipe-de-austin-state-historic-site/history/colonial-capital-texas#sthash.yjskobnq.dpuf
