history of the texas revolution the texas revolution began with the battle of gonzales in october 1835 and ended with the battle of san jacinto on april 21 1836 but there were earlier clashes between official forces and groups of colonists
this is a brief history of the texas revolution
events leading up to the texas
revolutionthe basic differences between the national habits and experiences of mexican rulers and the anglo­ american settlers in early day texas initially led to problems between the two groups
misunderstanding was aggravated in the minds of mexicans by their conviction that the united states government wan making use of the colonists to cause trouble in the hope of acquiring texas by purchase or revolution
military incidents occurred in 1826 1832 and 1835 preceding the decisive march to war in the fall of 1835
fredonian rebellion 1826 1827)the fredonian rebellion was a relatively short lived dispute between the mexican government and the edwards brothers haden and benjamin
haden edwards received an empresarial grant on april 14 1825 that entitled him to settle as many as 800 families in a broad area around nacogdoches in eastern texas
however because of his threatening behavior and attempt to turn the settlers against the mexican government and create a separate republic called fredonia haden edward 's grant was overturned forfeited in 1826
edwards was outraged and he found support in the settlers he had brought
on november 22 1826 martin parmer john s. roberts and burrell j. thompson led a group of thirty six men from the ayish bayou to nacogdoches where they seized norris haden edwards josé antonio sepulveda and others and tried them for oppression and corruption in office
as soon as mexican authorities heard of the incident lt col mateo ahumada principal military commander in texas was ordered to the area
he left san antonio on december 11 with twenty dragoons and 110 infantrymen
haden edwards and parmer began preparations to meet the mexican force in the name of an independent republic they called fredonia
since they planned to include the cherokees in their move for independence the flag they designed had two parallel bars red and white symbolizing indian and white
in fact although a treaty was signed with the indian leaders richard fields and john dunn hunter that support never materialized
the flag was inscribed independence liberty justice

the rebels signed it and flew it over the old stone fort
their declaration of independence was signed on december 21 1826
haden edwards designated his brother benjamin commander in chief and appealed to the united states for help
ahumada enlisted stephen f. austin who sided with the mexican government and peter ellis bean the mexican indian agent headed for nacogdoches
when the mexican officers and militia and members of austin 's colony reached nacogdoches on january 31 1827 the revolutionists fled and crossed the sabine river
the indians killed hunter and fields for involving them in the venture
anglo american attacks against the mexican garrisons 1832)a series of attacks by the anglo texians in 1832 resulted in the withdrawal of mexican garrisons from anahuac velasco nacogdoches and tenoxtitlán
in the anahuac disturbances the anglo­ american attack was led by john austin and commander john juan davis bradburn
fighting was determined at velasco where col domingo de ugartechea was attempting to prevent reinforcements and artillery from sailing to anahuac and both he and the insurgents suffered severely
battle of nacogdoches 1832)the battle of nacogdoches in 1832 resulted in the mexican garrison 's evacuation after only nominal resistance and col josé francisco ruiz a native of san antonio abandoned fort tenoxtitlán without being attacked
antonio lópez de santa anna was leading a revolution against president anastacio bustamante at the time of these disturbances in texas and the colonists who participated in them declared that they were cooperating with him by expelling bustamante 's garrisons from texas
actually the great mass of the colonists had no quarrel with mexico or mexicans and adopted resolutions assuring the authorities of their loyalty at least they wanted no war with mexico texans hold conventions and ask mexico for separation 1832 1833)the colonists held the conventions of 1832 and 1833 and asked for an extension of the tariff exemptions and to make texas an independent state
however the mexican government was very apprehensive over heavy anglo­a merican colonization so they passed the law of april 6 1830 forbidding immigrants to settle in territory adjacent to their native country
though this law was subsequently interpreted to permit continued settlement in the colonies of austin and green de witt it remained a menace to the development of texas and the conventions petitioned for its repeal
stephen austin arrested and held in mexico city 1933 1835)resolutions of the texian convention of 1832 were never delivered to mexico but instead stephen f. austin was sent to mexico city to present the petitions of 1833
on his way home austin was arrested and held as a prisoner in mexico until july 1835
anahuac- the spark leading to the texas revolution santa anna sent a contingent of soldiers to anahuac in january 1835 and in june of 1835 a mail courier brought news that mexican federal troops had arrested the governor and that a large number of santa annas reinforcements would soon strengthen the standing garrison at san antonio
william b. travis then commanded a group of texian volunteers and led a successful march against anahuac
capt
antonio tenorio surrendered the post without a contest
in october stephen f. austin returned from being held in the mexican prisons for three years
from this time forward only a spark was necessary to set off an explosion
at copano bay gen. martín perfecto de cos landed at the head of 500 men formed his troops and moved on san antonio
austin 's committee called for the immediate formation of military units to offer armed resistance
general cos announced his intention to punish those who led the uprising at anahuac and in his proclamation was the hint that he would drive the american settlers out of texas
the day after cos arrived in san antonio on october 9 texans seized goliad the location of a mexican constabulary on the road from copano to san antonio
there at the battle of gonzales what is regarded as the first shot in the texas revolution was fired
because of growing unrest the military commandant of coahuila and texas col domingo de ugartechea whose headquarters were also in san antonio demanded of the citizens of gonzales the return of a cannon that had been presented or at the least lent to them in 1831 for defence against indians
alcalde andrew ponton not only refused the demand but also called to other texans for help
annoyed by ponton 's refusal ugartechea sent about 100 dragoons under the command of lt francisco castañeda to seize the cannon forcibly if necessary
originally only eighteen men constituted the gonzales defense but by october 2 the ranks had increased to about 160 volunteers
commanded by john henry moore and joseph w. e. wallace the gonzales texans stood their ground and the dragoons returned empty­handed to san antonio
austin bowie and fannin lead the texian revolution texians reach point of no return october 1835 austin at this time in command of the newly formed texan army and in the gonzales vicinity realized that texas had reached the point of no return
in early october he therefore led his command all volunteers toward san antonio
two others shared the command james bowie and james w. fannin jr.
on the night of october 27 bowie in general command staked out a solid defensive position on the san antonio river not far from nuestra señora de la purísima concepcíon de acuña mission
battle of concepción october 27 1835)on the following morning at the battle of concepción the texians defeated a combined force of mexican foot and horse soldiers supported by artillery with the mexicans losing sixty men to the texans one
the grass fight nov. 26 1835)on november 26 the texans again faced the mexicans at the grass fight
once again bowie was in command but this time with edward burleson who assumed austin 's command the latter having been made commissioner to the united states by the provisional government
the texans forced the mexicans to retreat killing fifty of them in the process while losing three men
the climax of the siege of bexar came on december 5 when learning that burleson was considering withdrawal to goliad benjamin r. milam raised the defiant cry who will go to san antonio with old ben milam and he and frank francis w.
johnson led 300 volunteers into the heart of the city
after three days of house to house fighting milam was dead and san antonio was the prize of the texans
ironically cos 's final stand was at the alamo
forced to surrender the mexican commander was compelled to take his troops beyond the rio grande
santa anna and troops return to fight the texians january 1836)taking advantage of the divided texan army santa anna crossed the rio grande shortly in january of 1836 on a punitive expeditionto crush the texian uprising
his plan was to treat anyone in arms against his government as mere pirates
the quelling of piracy after all required no mercy
at the beginning of his campaign it seemed apparent that he would do just that for texan fortunes took a decided turn for the worse in early 1836
independence convention washington on the brazos march 2 1836)by march 2 the convention of 1836 meeting at washington­ on the­ brazos formally voted for independence and appointed sam houston major general of the texas army and commander of the forces at gonzales
after crossing the rio grande with 6,000 troops santa anna 's command eventually grew to more than 8,000
possible targets goliad with over 400 texians and the alamo with less than 150 defenders goliad with approximately 500 insurgents under the command of fannin stood at the door to east texas with its heavy american population
san antonio however even reinforced could not offer a real threat to santa anna or even to his line of communication
however the general was determined to march on san antonio in part because of the humiliation visited upon his family through defeat of his son in law cos unfortunately for santa anna 's army his logistical support was spare
he apparently had hoped to supplement his supplies by living off the land but the area south of san antonio could not sustain him
furthermore the weather that spring was unusually cold and wet
some of santa anna 's troops recruited from the yucatán died of hypothermia
meanwhile in san antonio the few texans were drawn into the confines of san antonio de valero mission in time known simply as the alamo
santa anna 's men begin arriving at the alamo feb. 23 1836)on february 23 santa anna 's advance force arrived in san antonio
for thirteen days the texans held their position behind the mission walls waiting for reinforcements to arrive from fannin 's men at goliad
battle of the alamo feb. 23 1836 march 6 1836)in one final onslaught to take the alamo occurred on march 6 1836
the texans were overwhelmed by sheer force of numbers
in bitter hand to hand combat all of the soldiers were killed while some thirty alamo noncombatants women children and blacks were spared
santa anna lost some 600 of his men or roughly a third of his assault force
gen. josé de urrea led a mexican army to capture goliad as santa anna 's men fought at the alamo gen. josé de urrea and his troops crossed the rio grande at matamoros with the destinatio of capturing goliad
urrea captured san patricio and was victorious at the battle of agua dulce creekand descended upon lt col william ward 's party who had been sent out from goliad to help the settlers at refurigo
battle of goliad march 20 1836)fannin the texan commander at goliad had gathered men to attack matamoros despite houston 's opposition
when he heard that urrea already had consolidated that position he changed his mind and fell back to goliad
houston ordered him to relieve the men at the alamo but by march 14 rescinded that order and issued a new one
fannin was to proceed with his entire command to victoria where a linking of forces would occur
however learning that ward and aaron king and all their men had been defeated by urrea fannin vacillated between defending goliad and retreating to victoria
finally on march 19 he decided too late to leave presidio la bahía and move toward houston
urrea immediately set out in pursuit
fannin fearing the exhaustion of his men and animals halted after a march of only six miles
the texans were not far from coleto creek with its water and protective treeline when urrea 's cavalry appeared blocked fannin 's path and seized the creek
when urrea 's main body arrived fannin could only form a square and wait
the next morning urrea received reinforcements including artillery
as mexican cannons leveled their guns on the texans and as mexican infantry formed attack columns fannin accepted the inevitable and asked for terms
he received what he at least regarded as an assurance that his army would be treated honorably as prisoners of war
the texans were marched back to goliad imprisoned and assured of their release
upon hearing the terms of surrender santa anna countermanded them and ordered the execution of the texans an order that was carried out on march 27 1836
the runaway scrape(mid march 1836)houston arrived in gonzales around the middle of march in a desperate attempt to gather volunteers at gonzalez and go to the assistance of the men at the alamo
however susanna dickinson widow of almeron dickinson told houston of the fall of the alamo and that santa anna 's army was pressing toward gonzalez
realizing that the revolution was in serious jeopardy houston chose to sink his cannons in the guadalupe river and the town and retreat northeast toward the colorado river
the inhabitants of gonzales refurigo and area settlements were in full panic knowing about santa anna 's approaching death squads from all over east texas in what became known as the runaway scrape
with the fall of the alamo and goliad santa anna presumed that the texians were defeated and that the war was over
however his officers convinced him that he still had to run down houston and the remaining texan forces
santa anna then planned a three-­pronged offensive through east texas
gen. antonio gaona was initially to take a northerly route via bastrop toward nacogdoches but shortly thereafter santa anna ordered him instead to proceed from bastrop toward san felipe
gen. joaquín ramírez y sesma was also ordered to san felipe whence he would strike in an easterly direction with the probable destination of anahuac
ramirez y sesma 's troops were to act as the spearhead of the thrust
finally urrea was to secure the right flank of these movements while maintaining a northerly route in the hope of joining the main forces should a mass formation be necessary
houston was thus to be snared his army crushed or captured and the rebellion finished
on march 20 ramirez y sesma and some 800 troops reached the colorado
houston 's army at this time probably outnumbered the mexicans but sam houston refused to fight for several reasons
he realized that although his army was patriotically motivated it was poorly trained
furthermore his enemy had artillery and he did not
finally santa anna 's plan allowed for rapid communication and consequent quick reinforcement
houston thought that he could not risk it for if he lost there would be nothing to stop santa anna from marching unimpeded across texas
this last consideration became all the more important after march 2 the date on which the convention approved the texas declaration of independence
in houston 's mind nothing less was at stake than independent nationhood
nevertheless disappointed that he did not attack a number of his troops began to question his leadership and a discipline problem developed that lasted all the way to san jacinto
at some point houston learned of the execution of fannin 's destruction and turned his army in full retreat northward toward the brazos river and jared groce 's plantation
he went by way of san felipe de austin which he torched
by now houston 's disgruntled force had shrunk to no more than 800 men
some allege that he wanted to retreat as far as the trinity river others that he merely intended to teach his little army the fundamentals of the drill while waiting for reinforcement
in either event captains wyly martin and moseley baker balked claiming that they would fight the enemy on their own
houston solved the problem by ordering these men and their followers to establish a rear guard to hold up a mexican advance
but discontent came not only from the ranks but from the government
houston was strongly criticized by president david g. burnetqv as well
in the meantime burnet and the cabinet fled new washington the most recent capital of the new government for harrisburg
time passed slowly at groce 's plantation but the troops did receive the rudiments of battlefield drill and formation
the weather stayed bad and disease became a problem
in these troubles houston 's command was buttressed by two loyal supporters col thomas j. rusk and col edward burleson
upon hearing of burnet 's flight santa anna also decided to move on harrisburg
because of this error he lost sight of his objective houston 's army
in addition this pursuit meant that he would be required to divide his force further
nevertheless santa anna decided on the chase and personally led the advancing force
when he arrived in harrisburg he discovered that the texas government had fled again so he ordered col juan n. almonte ahead
almonte nearly succeeded in capturing the escaping officials
by now however houston was on the move again this time to the east
at the fork between the road to nacogdoches and that to harrisburg the army swung toward the latter and the character of the campaign changed
houston who had been slow and deliberate in his manner now became swift and animated and his strike toward harrisburg resembled a forced march
on the way he intercepted mexican couriers from whom he learned the location and size of santa anna 's force
gathering his men around him houston eloquently addressed them and called upon them to remember the alamo and goliad
by now both houston and santa anna on separate roads were headed for lynch 's ferry on the san jacinto river
still concerned about reinforcement for he knew that cos would soon join his adversary houston crossed and then destroyed vince 's bridge
during the remainder of the campaign the possibility of mexican reinforcement was never far from his mind
the texans reached lynch 's ferry at the confluence of the san jacinto river and buffalo bayou first
on the banks of both bodies of water was marshland flanked by heavy foliage mostly live oak spread laterally
in the tree line beside buffalo bayou houston aligned his force on april 20
later on the same day santa anna 's force surprised by the texan presence also arrived
in the late afternoon there was a brief but sharp clash between elements of the two armies but nothing serious developed
apparently santa anna decided to await reinforcements which arrived the following morning in the form of cos 's command
meanwhile houston held his first council of war wherein the merits of an offensive or a defensive battle were debated
on the afternoon of april 21 houston ordered his small force of perhaps 900 men forward
santa anna 's army numbering somewhere around 1,300 men was resting
santa anna had concluded that the texans were on the defensive and he had decided to attack them the next day
because of this costly miscalculation houston surprised and completely overran the enemy the battle took only eighteen minutes
shouts of remember the alamo
 and remember goliad filled the air and in this charged atmosphere the killing continued for an hour after the issue was resolved
virtually the entire mexican army was killed scattered or captured including santa anna who managed to escape but was captured the following day
in effect the mexicans lost everything and the texans by comparison lost nine men
on houston 's command santa anna ordered his second­in­command gen. vicente filisola to withdraw all his troops from texas and the order was obeyed
if the mexican army had remained in texas it is probable that the war would have continued
many texans wanted santa anna 's life but houston aware of the mexican general 's value alive spared him
the war was concluded by the two treaties of velasco one public the other secret
the first was published as soon as possible and its contents held conditions very favorable to texas
by its terms texas independence was recognized hostilities were ended the mexican army was retired beyond the rio grande confiscated property would be restored and prisoners would be exchanged
the secret treaty agreed to santa anna 's release in exchange for his promise that he would do all he could to secure within the mexican government all the provisions of the public treaty without exception as well as the enforcement of them
santa anna agreed as was his perceived prerogative since by destroying the constitution of 1824 he had assumed authority over mexican foreign policy
the remaining mexican government refused to accept these terms however
nevertheless texas became not only a de facto state but also a de jure state in the eyes of many nations

texas declaration of independence- 1835 the texas declaration of november 7 1835 passed by the consultation announced that the texan war against mexico principally intended to restore the mexican constitution of 1824 abrogated by the actions of president antonio lopez de santa anna and to achieve separate mexican statehood for texas
the members of the consultation had hoped to attract popular support for the texan cause from the other mexican states
declaration of independence by the republic of texas 1836to the public
the undersigned plenipotentiaries from the republic of texas to the united states of america respectfully present to the american people the unanimous declaration of independence made by the people of texas in general convention on the 2d day of march 1836 and also the constitution framed by the same body
robert hamilton geo c. childress
washington city may 22 1836
unanimous declaration of independence by thedelegates of the people of texas
in general convention at the town of washington on the 2d day of march 1836
when a government has ceased to protect the lives liberty and property of the people from whom its legitimate powers are derived and for the advancement of whose happiness it was instituted and so far from being a guarantee for the enjoyment of their inestimable and inalienable rights becomes an instrument in the hands of evil rules for their oppression when the federal republican constitution of their country which they have sworn to support no longer has a substantial existence and the whole nature of their government has been forcibly changed without their consent from a restricted federative republic composed of sovereign states to a consolidated central military despotism in which every interest is disregarded but that of the army and the priesthood both the eternal enemies of civil liberty the ever ready minions of power and the usual instruments tyrants when long after the spirit of the constitution has departed moderation is at length so far lost by those in power that even the semblance of freedom is removed and the forms themselves of the constitution discontinued and so far from their petitions and remonstrances being regarded the agents who bear them are thrown into dungeons and mercenary armies sent forth to force a new government upon them at the point of the bayonet when in consequence of such acts of malfeasance and abdication on the part of the government anarchy prevails and civil society is dissolved into its original elements in such a crisis the first law of nature the right of self preservation the inherent and inalienable right of the people to appeal to first principles and take their political affairs into their own hands in extreme cases enjoins it as a right towards themselves and a sacred obligation to their posterity to abolish such government and create another in its stead calculated to rescue them from impending dangers and to secure their future welfare and happiness
nations as well as individuals are amenable for their acts to the public opinion of mankind
a statement of a part of our grievances is therefore submitted to an impartial world in justification of the hazardous but unavoidable step now taken of severing our political connexion with the mexican people and assuming an independent attitude among the nations of the earth
the mexican government by its colonization laws invited and induced the anglo american population of texas to colonize its wilderness under the pledged faith of a written constitution that they should continue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and republican government to which they had been habituated in the land of their birth the united states of america
in this expectation they have been cruelly disappointed inasmuch as the mexican nation has acquiesced in the late changes made in the government by general antonio lopez de santa ana who having overturned the constitution of his country now offers us the cruel alternative either to abandon our homes acquired by so many privations or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny the combined despotism of the sword and the priesthood
it hath sacrificed our welfare to the state of coahuila by which our interests have been continually depressed through a jealous and partial course of legislation carried on at a far distant seat of government by a hostile majority in an unknown tongue and this too notwithstanding we have petitioned in the humblest terms for the establishment of a separate state government and have in accordance with the provisions of the national constitution presented to the general congress a republican constitution which was without just cause contemptuously rejected
it incarcerated in a dungeon for a long time one of our citizens for no other cause but a zealous endeavor to procure the acceptance of our constitution and the establishment of a state government
it has failed and refused to secure on a firm basis the right of trial by jury that palladium of civil liberty and only safe guarantee for the life liberty and property of the citizen
it has failed to establish any public system of education although possessed of almost boundless resources the public domain and although it is an axiom in political science that unless a people are educated and enlightened it is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty or the capacity for self government
it has suffered the military commandants stationed among us to exercise arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny thus trampling upon the most sacred rights of the citizen and rendering the military superior to the civil power
it has dissolved by force of arms the state congress of coahuila and texas and obliged our representatives to fly for their lives from the seat of government thus depriving us of the fundamental political right of representation
it has demanded the surrender of a number of our citizens and ordered military detachments to seize and carry them into the interior for trial in contempt of the civil authorities and in defiance of the laws and the constitution it has made piratical attacks upon our commerce by commissioning foreign desperadoes and authorizing them to seize our vessels and convey the property of our citizens to far distant ports for confiscation
it denies us the right of worshipping the almighty according to dictates of our own conscience by the support of a national religion calculated to promote the temporal interests of its human functionaries rather than the glory of the true and living god
it has demanded us to deliver up our arms which are essential for our defence the rightful property of freemen and formidable only to tyrannical governments
it has invaded our country both by sea and by land with intent to lay waste our territory and drive us from our homes and has now a large mercenary army advancing to carry on against us a war of extermination
it has through its emissaries incited the merciless savage with the tomahawk and scalping knife the massacre the inhabitants of our defenceless frontiers
it has been during the whole time of our connexion with it the contemptible sport and victim of successive military revolutions and hath continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak corrupt and tyrannical government
these and other grievances were patiently borne by the people of texas until they reached that point at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue
they then took up arms in defence of the national constitution
they appealed to their mexican brethren for assistance
their appeal has been made in vain though months have elapsed no sympathetic response has yet been heard from the interior
they are therefore forced to the melancholy conclusion that the mexican people have acquiesced in the destruction of their liberty and the substitution therefor of a military despotism that they are unfit to be free and incapable of self government
the necessity of self preservation therefore now decrees our eternal political separation
we therefore the delegates with plenary powers of the people of texas in solemn convention assembled appealing to a candid world for the necessities of our condition do hereby resolve and declare that our political connexion with the mexican nation has forever ended and that the people of texas do now constitute a free sovereign and independent republic and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent states and conscious of the rectitude of our intentions we fearlessly and confidently commit the issue to the decision of the supreme arbiter of the destinies of nations

texas independence convention at washington on the brazos 1836)the constitutional convention of 1836 met at washington on the brazos on march 1 1836
on the first day convention president richard ellis appointed george c. childress james gaines edward conrad collin mc kinney and bailey hardeman as a committee to draft a declaration of independence
george childress the committee chairman is generally accepted as the author of the texas declaration of independence with little help from the other committee members
since the six page document was submitted for a vote of the whole convention on the following day childress probably already had a draft version of the document with him when he arrived
as the delegates worked they received regular reports on the ongoing siege on the alamo by the forces of santa anna 's troops
historic letter from william b travis at the seige of the alamo february 24 1836)i shall never surrender or retreat
then i call on you in the name of liberty of patriotism and everything dear to the american character to come to our aid with all dispatch 
victory or death
little help came
santa anna 's troops broke through on march 6 all of the defenders of the alamo died
the battle of san jacinto the battle of san jacinto was the concluding military event of the texas revolution
on march 13 1836 the revolutionary army at gonzales began to retreat eastward
it crossed the colorado river on march 17 and camped near present columbia on march 20 recruiting and reinforcements having increased its size to 1,200 men
sam houston 's scouts reported mexican troops west of the colorado to number 1,325
on march 25 the texans learned of james w. fannin 's defeat at goliad and many of the men left the army to join their families on the runaway scrape
sam houston led his troops to san felipe de austin by march 28 and by march 30 to the jared e. groce plantation on the brazos river where they camped and drilled for a fortnight
ad interim president david g. burnet ordered houston to stop his retreat secretary of war thomas j. rusk urged him to take a more decisive course
antonio lópez de santa anna decided to take possession of the texas coast and seaports
with that object in view he crossed the brazos river at present richmond on april 11 and on april 15 with some 700 men arrived at harrisburg
he burned harrisburg and started in pursuit of the texas government at new washington or morgan 's point where he arrived on april 19 to find that the government had fled to galveston
the mexican general then set out for anahuac by way of lynchburg
meanwhile the texans on april 11 received the twin sisters and with the cannon as extra fortification crossed the brazos river on the yellow stone and on april 16 reached spring creek in present harris county
on april 17 to the gratification of his men houston took the road to harrisburg instead of the road to louisiana and on april 18 reached white oak bayou at a site within the present city limits of houston
there he learned that santa anna had gone down the west side of the bayou and the san jacinto river crossing by a bridge over vince 's bayou
the mexicans would have to cross the same bridge to return
viewing this strategic situation on the morning of april 19 houston told his troops that it looked as if they would soon get action and admonished them to remember the massacres at san antonio and at goliad
on the evening of april 19 his forces crossed buffalo bayou to the west side 2½ miles below harrisburg
some 248 men mostly sick and ineffective were left with the baggage at the camp opposite harrisburg
the march was continued until midnight
at dawn on april 20 the texans resumed their trek down the bayou and at lynch 's ferry captured a boat laden with supplies for santa anna
they then drew back about a mile on the harrisburg road and encamped in a skirt of timber protected by a rising ground
that afternoon sidney sherman with a small detachment of cavalry engaged the enemy infantry almost bringing on a general action
in the clash olwyns j. trask was mortally wounded one other texan was wounded and several horses were killed
mirabeau b. lamar a private so distinguished himself that on the next day he was placed in command of the cavalry
santa anna made camp under the high ground overlooking a marsh about three fourths of a mile from the texas camp and threw up breastworks of trunks baggage packsaddles and other equipment
both sides prepared for the conflict
on thursday morning april 21 the texans were eager to attack
about nine o'clock they learned that martín perfecto de cos had crossed vince 's bridge with about 540 troops and had swelled the enemy forces to about 1,200
houston ordered erastus deaf smith to destroy the bridge and prevent further enemy reinforcements
the move would prevent the retreat of either the texans or the mexicans towards harrisburg
shortly before noon houston held a council of war with edward burleson sidney sherman henry w. millard alexander somervell joseph l. bennett and lysander wells
two of the officers suggested attacking the enemy in his position the others favored waiting santa anna 's attack
houston withheld his own views at the council but later after having formed his plan of battle had it approved by rusk houston disposed his forces in battle order about 3:30 in the afternoon while all was quiet on the mexican side during the afternoon siesta
the texans movements were screened by trees and the rising ground and evidently santa anna had no lookouts posted
the battle line was formed with edward burleson 's regiment in the center sherman 's on the left wing the artillery under george w. hockley on burleson 's right the infantry under henry millard on the right of the artillery and the cavalry under lamar on the extreme right
the twin sisters were wheeled into position and the whole line led by sherman 's men sprang forward on the run with the cry remember the alamo
 remember goliad
the battle lasted but eighteen minutes
according to houston 's official report the casualties were 630 mexicans killed and 730 taken prisoner
against this only nine of the 910 texans were killed or mortally wounded and thirty were wounded less seriously
houston 's ankle was shattered by a rifle ball
the texans captured a large supply of muskets pistols sabers mules horses provisions clothing tents and $ 12,000 in silver
santa anna disappeared during the battle and search parties were sent out on the morning of the 22
the party consisted of james a. sylvester washington h. secrest sion r. bostick and a mr. cole discovered santa anna hiding in the grass
he was dirty and wet and was dressed as a common soldier
the search party did not recognize him until he was addressed as el presidente by other mexican prisoners
