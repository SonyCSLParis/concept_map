next sunday is remembrance sunday 11/11/12
at 4.40 in the afternoon channel 4 will be broadcasting the programme we filmed at the machine gun corps training camp at belton park just outside grantham lincolnshire
i ’m not sure how this will affect the rest of the final series series 20 when it ’s eventually screened hopefully next january
maybe they ’ll repeat or re edit it maybe not
i just do n’t know
but i do know that the decision to show it on remembrance sunday is a good one
we made the film with reverence and i think that comes across certainly in phil ’s performance at the close of the film
he was genuinely very moved as was everyone who witnessed what happened
one of the things that time team does oops i should have said did to those of us who are part of the team both on and off screen could be called total immersion
yes we ’re making a film but like method actors we ’re also completely and utterly involved
you ca n’t do it any other way
you ’re either in or you ’re out and the chances are you ’re out for good if that happens
and that of course was what happened in the trenches
it really was total immersion then
in fact it made our escapades look positively superficial
plus there was the ever present element of extreme danger
death lay around every corner
and filth mud and decaying bodies everywhere
now i would n’t dream of comparing the making of a time team film to life in the trenches
that would patently be absurd but even in our very small way we found over those twenty years that the pressure of having to produce a good film in just three days was a great leveller
our shoots were n’t like feature films where the great stars retreat to their swanky trailers or as we ’d call them in the uk caravans
no we were all in it together and in the process we made life long friendships which will survive for decades to come
and these friendships ignored all barriers so archaeologists did n’t just mix with archaeologists and film crews with film crews
i ’ve made loads of friends among cameramen and sound recordists not to mention directors assistant producers researchers runners etc
in fact these friendships set me thinking when we were filming at belton
my grand father lt col walter marlborough pryor dso was for a time the commanding officer of the royal warwickshire regiment in fact he was promoted to c.o. in the trenches of the somme
in theory of course there ’s a big divide between officers and men
in camps at home they eat sleep and socialise in separate quarters
but on active service those barriers soon break down
you do n’t salute on the front line as that tells any enemy sniper that there ’s an officer present
and officers especially senior ones make better more telling targets for obvious reasons
i ’ve spoken to friends who were soldiers once and the officer men thing gets abandoned quite quickly when guns start firing in anger
so to return to my grand father his closest best friend was his batman valet servant in the trenches
after the great war he became his driver and right hand man
i ’ve never seen a less master servant type of relationship they were friends close friends
i did n’t realise it when i was a child but i was witnessing one of the long term effects of that brutal conflict the rapid breaking down of the rigid edwardian and victorian class structure
ww2 pretty much completed the job
of course that ’s not to say that british snobbery has been finished off
far from it
but at least now it ’s just based on wealth there ’s no implication that the upper echelons of society are superior in any other way
in fact i ’m far from certain i envy them their money do i honestly want endless oysters and champagne
it ’s the rarity of them in my life that makes each occasion special
i think we ’re slowly beginning to understand to what extent the great war altered the modern world
but it has been a slow process
again i used to think that you could n’t reach a balanced historical assessment of any major event for about fifty years
i wonder now whether that should n’t be seventy or eighty maybe closer to a full century
and why
because we ’re all living far longer and the one aspect of life that changes more slowly than any other stares back at us from our mirrors every morning
like it or not we are all of us making and affecting history even long after the events in question took place
and that is why the cutting short of so many young lives was and still is such an appalling tragedy

there was archaeology just below the surface where there were also loads of roots and other obstacles
