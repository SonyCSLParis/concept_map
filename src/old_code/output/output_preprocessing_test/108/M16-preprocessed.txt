belton house photo by wehha via wikipedia belton house located near grantham lincolnshire england was built between 1685 and 1688 for young sir john brownlow
brownlow was the eldest surviving son of sir richard brownlow and elizabeth freke
in 1679 he inherited the belton estates from his great uncle sir john brownlow 1st baronet of belton
the brownlow family started to acquire land in the grantham area in 1598 but did not acquired the belton manor house until 1619
when sir john inherited the property from his great uncle he decided to build a new country house on the property
the architect believed to be responsible for the initial design of the house was william winde
the house has been attributed to sir christopher wren while some believe it was designed by roger pratt
though there is the most evidence linking the design to winde it is not one hundred percent clear that he designed the house

belton house is an example of the carolean style which is also known as the restoration style
the style was popular in england following the restoration of the english monarchy and during the reign of charles ii
the style has many similarities to palladio 's designs
belton house features a double pile plan with a saloon at the center of the house
it also followed the older style of having the reception rooms and bedrooms spread throughout the house 's main floors
the floor plan followed pratt 's theory that guest and family rooms should be separated

belton house was in the brownlow family for over 300 years
alternations were made to the house and up until the 20th century the family were able to keep the house in good repair
like many members of the aristocracy the brownlows had financial problems following world war i.
it became increasing hard for the family to maintain the house and property
they attempted to open the house to the public in order to keep the house in the family but that attempt failed
in 1984 the 7th baron of belton transferred ownership to the national trust which continues to operate the house as a historic site
since becoming a national trust site belton house has been used as a film location in several mini series
it is probably best known as being the location for rosings park in the 1995 adaption of pride and prejudice
it has also been seen in bleak house 1985 2005 jane eyre 2006 and the buccaneers 1995
