written by lauren c(83)belton houselauren c(83 on 14/3/11lauren c(83 says really excellent adventure playground there s a fenced off section for little ones with a slide swings a little playhouse and see saw
and for older children there are masses of equipment including climbing frames curly slides a big fortress wooden castle an aerial slide too much to name
the adventure playground 's entrance is beautiful too you walk over a bridge with a fast running stream underneath its very safe with fences and walk into woodland where the adventure playground is
there is also a little open air train ride journey which costs £ 1 per child and the adult will need to pay £ 1 too to ride with their child
it goes the length of the playground and back again
there are picnic benches all over the adventure playground to have lunch
its a lovely place to visit
when you come out of the adventure playground there s formal gardens behind the belton house mansion where there is a massive fountain and pond and beyond that a huge original green house with lovely rare flowers in
the house is extremely interesting to visit and they open the attics and basements on special dates throughout the year
there is also a coffee shop ice cream stands a restaurant a second hand bookshop a shop that sells plants and gardening items
there are plenty of toilets baby changing facilities disabled toilets
its such a big place you can easily spend the entire day there and still not see everything
there is also a boating lake and woods to walk in
brilliant
written by catherine d(8)belton house catherine d(8 on 21/3/10catherine d(8 says went here with my husband and two kids aged 4 and 1 on a free weekend opening
it was fantastic
it is n't that far only about 40 minutes tops from oakham just through grantham town centre
the adventure playground is the biggest i 've seen about 200 m long and jammed packed full of things for every age of child even a wooden fort 
the house is stunning and so are the grounds
plenty of open space for kids to run riot take a ball picnic bikes and spend the whole day there
there is a cafe restaurant gift shop plant shop and even a discovery learning centre for kids to colour read make etc check the website for opening times and costs quite expensive
but you can just do the grounds
written by joanne m(467)belton house joanne m(467 on 4/8/08joanne m(467 says huge adventure playground which is suitable for all ages
lots of flat space for ball games also formal gardens maze woodland walk and short mini train ride costs £ 1 per person
lots of space for kids to tire themselves out in
there is a cafe on site or take a picnic and you can easily spend all day there
the only downside is that it is quite pricey to get in £ 20 family ticket for grounds only £ 25 if you want to see inside the house as well
