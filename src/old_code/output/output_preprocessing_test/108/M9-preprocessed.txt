belton house lincolnshire during medieval times the manor of belton was owned by st mary 's abbey at york but after the dissolution of the monasteries the land reverted back to the crown
no architectural evidence has been found of the original manor house if indeed there was one but the surviving gate piers of a post dissolution residence can still be seen in the north wall by the orangery
in the late 17th century having inherited most of his great uncle 's wealth as well as his estate at belton sir john brownlow decided to build a new country house for his family
several architects have been associated with belton house including sir christopher wren but it is more feasible that william winde and william stanton were largely responsible for the design and construction of the property possibly seeking advice from roger pratt
after a slow start belton house took less than four years to complete sir john and lady brownlow moving in during november 1688
initially the d√©cor and furnishings were recorded as being quite modest but it seems a more luxurious finish was created during the 1690s
the epitome of brownlow 's success is perhaps reflected in the fact that he entertained king william iii on one occasion for which he was duly honoured
two years later he had taken his own life but the reason is still a mystery
although several rooms underwent a number of functional changes throughout the 300 years it belonged to the brownlow family belton house today represents a perfect example of a neo caroline english country house
this vast h shaped residence was given a major refurbishment at the hands of sir jeffrey wyatville in the early 19th century but the 3rd earl was responsible for the remodelling programme later that century that restored much of the original caroline splendour to belton house
during the 1960s an extensive restoration of the property was carried out to prevent further deterioration of the fabric
there are over 200 pictures on public display a large proportion of them being late 17th century portraits a sizeable collection of porcelain and silver and an impressive array of regency furniture throughout the many rooms of belton house
the marble hall gives the visitor a first impression of the elegance they are about to witness and a hint of the various periods now beautifully brought together under one roof
in the east wing of belton house the chapel drawing room and gallery retain their 17th century interiors almost intact and the chapel itself contains a stunning reredos of the same period
this carved wooden masterpiece resembles a grinling gibbons altar decoration to be found at trinity college oxford and was painted to give a marble like appearance at the end of the 19th century
of particular interest is the rare example of a painted floor in the tyrconnel room the actual date of which is unknown but believed to be early 19th century
upstairs two of the bedrooms show very distinct styles
the yellow bedroom survives as one of the james wyatt interiors dating from the 1770s and the queens bedroom has been restored to its original appearance of 1841 when queen adelaide stayed at belton house
no country house worthy of note is complete without a setting of formal gardens sculptured parkland water features and parterres
little has survived of the spectacular baroque garden created for sir john brownlow but wyatville 's classical plans have left belton house with a magnificent italian garden fountain and orangery
the grounds alone require a few hours to fully appreciate their beauty and expanse but to take in a tour of belton house as well a whole day should be allowed
on the other hand this is an ideal place to re visit at different times of the year and monitor the ever changing vistas
belton house remained in the brownlow family until 1984 when it was given to the national trust
