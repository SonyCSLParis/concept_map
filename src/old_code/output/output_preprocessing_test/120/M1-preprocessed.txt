along turl street south of the east end of the chapel the entrance front was rebuilt in 1855 in an adaptation of the original homely jacobean style with a gate tower a lodge and impressively detailed chimneys faced in golden bath stone
the long south front opposite the covered market in market street was refaced in 1853 and 1875
