it is in the centre of the city on a site between turl street ship street cornmarket street and market street
the college was founded by elizabeth i on 27 june 1571 for the education of clergy though students now study a broad range of secular subjects
a major driving force behind the establishment of the college was hugh price or ap rhys a churchman from brecon in wales
the oldest buildings in the first quadrangle date from the 16th and early 17th centuries a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713 and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906
further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college in 1971 and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east oxford
the life of the college was disrupted by the english civil war
leoline jenkins who became principal after the war in 1661 put the college on a more stable financial footing
little happened at the college during the 18th century and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards
reforms of oxford university after two royal commissions in the latter half of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college 's fellowships and scholarships such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of welsh students and academics
students academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects
women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population
there are about 475 students at any one time the principal of the college is sir nigel shadbolt
former students include harold wilson who was twice british prime minister norman washington manley chief minister of jamaica t. e. lawrence lawrence of arabia angus buchanan winner of the victoria cross and viscount sankey lord chancellor
the university 's professorship of celtic is attached to the college a post held by scholars such as sir john rhys ellis evans and thomas charles edwards
past or present fellows of the college include the historians sir goronwy edwards and niall ferguson the philosopher galen strawson and the political philosopher john gray
historyfoundationsee also list of founding fellows scholars and commissioners of jesus college oxford the college 's founder queen elizabeth i shown in a portrait in the college hall jesus college was founded on 27 june 1571 when elizabeth i issued a royal charter
2 it was the first protestant college to be founded at the university and it is the only oxford college to date from elizabeth 's reign
3][4 it was the first new oxford college since 1555 in the reign of queen mary when trinity college and st john 's college were founded as roman catholic colleges
5 the foundation charter named a principal david lewis eight fellows eight scholars and eight commissioners to draw up the statutes for the college
6 the commissioners included hugh price who had petitioned the queen to found a college at oxford that he might bestow his estate of the maintenance of certain scholars of wales to be trained up in good letters
 7 the college was originally intended primarily for the education of clergy
the particular intention was to satisfy a need for dedicated learned clergy to promote the elizabethan religious settlement in the parishes of england ireland and wales
the college has since broadened the range of subjects offered beginning with the inclusion of medicine and law and now offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university
the letters patent issued by elizabeth i made it clear that the education of a priest in the 16th century included more than just theology however:[2] to the glory of god almighty and omnipotent and for the spread and maintenance of the christian religion in its sincere form for the eradication of errors and heresies for the increase and perpetuation of true loyalty for the extension of good literature of every sort for the knowledge of languages for the education of youth in loyalty morality and methodical learning for the relief of poverty and distress and lastly for the benefit and well being of the church of christ in our realms we have decreed that a college of learning in the sciences philosophy humane pursuits knowledge of the hebrew greek and latin languages to the ultimate profession of sacred theology to last for all time to come be created founded built and established —elizabeth

price continued to be closely involved with the college after its foundation
on the strength of a promised legacy worth £ 60 a year on his death approximately £ 15100 in present day terms),[8 he requested and received the authority to appoint the new college 's principal fellows and scholars
he financed early building work in the college 's front quadrangle but on his death in 1574 it transpired that the college received only a lump sum of around £ 600 approximately £ 151000 in present day terms
8][9 problems with his bequest meant that it was not received in full for about 25 years
as the college had no other donors at this time for many years the college had buildings but no revenue
10]monument to sir eubule thelwall 1630 in jesus college chapel oxford
the main benefactor other than the king was eubule thelwall from ruthin north wales who became principal in 1621 he succeeded in securing a new charter and statutes for the college from james i having spent £ 5,000 of his own money on the hall and chapel which earned him the title of its second founder
11 thelwall died on 8 october 1630 aged 68 and was buried in jesus college chapel where a monument was erected to his memory by his brother sir bevis thelwall page of the king 's bedchamber and clerk of the great wardrobe
other benefactions in the 17th century include herbert westfaling the bishop of hereford left enough property to support two fellowships and scholarships with the significant proviso that my kindred shallbe always preferred before anie others
12 sir eubule thelwall principal 1621–30 spent much of his own money on the construction of a chapel hall and library for the college
the library constructed above an over weak colonnade was pulled down under the principalship of francis mansell 1630–49 who also built two staircases of residential accommodation to attract the sons of welsh gentry families to the college

the english civil war all but destroyed the corporate life of the college
 14 mansell was removed from his position as principal and michael roberts was installed
after the restoration mansell was briefly reinstated as principal before resigning in favour of leoline jenkins
14][15 it was jenkins principal 1661–73 who secured the long term viability of the college
on his death in 1685 he bequeathed a large complex of estates acquired largely by lawyer friends from the over mortgaged landowners of the restoration period
these estates allowed the college 's sixteen fellowships and scholarships to be filled for the first time officially sixteen of each had been supported since 1622 but the college 's income was too small to keep all occupied simultaneously
13 in 1713 the bequest of welsh clergyman and former student edmund meyricke established a number of scholarships for students from north wales
16]18th and 19th centuries
an 1837 engraving of the first quadrangle the 18th century in contrast to the disruption of the 17th century was a comparatively quiet time for the college
a historian of the college j. n. l. baker wrote that the college records for this time tell of little but routine entries and departures of fellows and scholars
16 the napoleonic wars saw a reduction in the numbers of students and entries in the records for the purchase of muskets and other items for college members serving in the university corps
after the war numbers rose to an average of twenty new students per year between 1821 and 1830
however debts owed to the college had increased perhaps due to the economic effects of the war by 1832 the college was owed £ 986 10s 5d approximately £ 82700 in present day terms
16][17][8 during the first half of the 19th century the academic strength of the college diminished scholarships were sometimes not awarded because of a lack of suitable candidates and numbers fell there were only seven new entrants in 1842
17 ernest hardy wrote in his history of the college in 1899 that it had been becoming increasingly evident for years that the exclusive connection with wales was ruining the college as a place of education
 18]a royal commission was appointed in 1852 to investigate the university
the college wished to retain its links with wales and initial reforms were limited despite the wishes of the commissioners those scholarships that were limited to particular parts of wales were opened to the whole of wales and half of the fellowships awarded were to remain open only to welshmen if and so long as the principal and fellows shall deem it expedient for the interests of education in connection with the principality of wales
17 all the scholarships at the college except for two and all the exhibitions were still restricted to students from wales
19 the numbers of students at the college still fell despite prizes being awarded for success in university examinations
daniel harper principal from 1877 to 1895 noted the continuing academic decline
speaking in 1879 he noted that fewer students from the college were reaching high standards in examinations and that more welsh students were choosing to study at other oxford colleges in preference to jesus
a further royal commission was appointed
this led to further changes at the college in 1882 the fellowships reserved to welshmen were made open to all and only half instead of all of the 24 scholarships were to be reserved for welsh candidates
20][21 thereafter numbers gradually rose and the non welsh element at the college increased so that by 1914 only about half of the students were welsh
20]20th century during the first world war the college in the ordinary sense almost ceased to exist
20 from 129 students in the summer of 1914 numbers dropped to 36 in the spring of 1916
some refugee students from belgium and serbia lodged in empty rooms in the college during 1916 and officers of the royal flying corps resided from august 1916 to december 1918
after the war numbers rose and fellowships were added in new subjects history 1919 and 1933 theology 1927 physics 1934 a second fellowship in chemistry 1924 and modern languages lectureship 1921 fellowship 1944
the improved teaching led to greater success in university examinations and prizes
22]harold wilson in the inter war years 1918–39 jesus was seen by some as a small college and something of a backwater it attracted relatively few pupils from the public schools traditionally seen as the most prestigious
23 the college did however attract many academically able entrants from the grammar schools particularly those in northern england and scotland
among these grammar school boys was harold wilson who would later become prime minister of the united kingdom
24 during the second world war many of the fellows served in the armed forces or carried out war work in oxford
the college remained full of students though as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned and also housed officers on military courses
25]the college had its own science laboratories from 1907 to 1947 which were overseen for all but the last three years by the physical chemist david chapman a fellow of the college from 1907 to 1944
at the time of their closure they were the last college based science laboratories at the university
26 they were named the sir leoline jenkins laboratories after a former principal of the college
the laboratories led to scientific research and tuition particularly in chemistry becoming an important part of the college 's academic life
27
the brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates as well as attracting to jesus college graduates of the university of wales who wished to continue their research at oxford
a link between one of the college science lecturers and imperial chemical industries ici led to 17 students joining ici between the two world wars some such as john rose reaching senior levels in the company
the laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students they were closed in 1947
27]the quatercentenary of the college in 1971 saw the opening of the old members buildings in the third quadrangle
28 further student accommodation has been built at the sports ground and at a site in north oxford
29 in 1974 jesus was among the first group of five men 's colleges to admit women as members the others being brasenose wadham hertford and st catherine's;[30 between one third and one half of the undergraduates are women
31 a long standing rivalry with nearby exeter college reached a peak in 1979 with seven police vehicles and three fire engines involved in dealing with trouble in turl street
32 sir john habakkuk principal 1967–84 and sir peter north principal 1984–2005 both served terms as vice chancellor of the university from 1973 to 1977 and from 1993 to 1997 respectively
31]location and buildings the main entrance main article buildings of jesus college oxford the main buildings are located in the centre of oxford between turl street ship street cornmarket street and market street
the main entrance is on turl street
the buildings are arranged in three quadrangles the first quadrangle containing the oldest college buildings and the third quadrangle the newest
the foundation charter gave to the college a site between market street and ship street which is still occupied by the college as well as the buildings of a defunct university academic hall on the site called white hall
33 the buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s the principal 's lodgings were the last to be built
progress was slow because the new college lacked the generous endowments that earlier colleges enjoyed
34 before new buildings were completed the students lived in the old buildings of white hall
35]first quadrangle front door of the principal 's lodgings showing the shell hood of c.1700the chapel was dedicated on 28 may 1621 and extended in 1636
36 the architectural historian giles worsley has described the chapel 's east window added in 1636 as an instance of gothic revival architecture rather than gothic survival since a choice was made to use an outdated style classical architecture had become accepted as the only style in which it was respectable to build
37 jonathan edwards principal from 1686 to 1712 is reported to have spent £ 1,000 approximately £ 134,900 in present day terms)[8 during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel including the addition of a screen separating the main part of the chapel from the ante chapel at the west end in 1693
38 in 1853 stained glass by george hedgeland was added to the east window
39 in 1863 the architect george edmund street was appointed to renovate the chapel
the arch of the chancel was widened the original jacobean woodwork was removed save for the screen donated by edwards and the pulpit new seats were installed new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel and a stone reredos was added behind the altar
39][40 views of the changes have differed
on 21 october 1864 building news reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of a very spirited character
it said that the new handsome arch showed the east window to great advantage with other improvements including a handsome reredos
39 ernest hardy principal from 1921 to 1925 said that the work was ill considered",[38 described the reredos as somewhat tawdry and said that the jacobean woodwork had been sold off too cheaply
41 in contrast the architectural historian nikolaus pevsner called the reredos heavily gorgeous
42]the principal of the college resides in the lodgings a grade i listed building,[43 on the north side of the first quadrangle between the chapel to the east and the hall to the west
they were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built
44 sir eubule thelwall principal from 1621 to 1630 built the lodgings at his own expense to include in the words of the antiquarian anthony wood a very fair dining room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven
45 the shell hood over the doorway which pevsner called beautiful")[42 was added at some point between 1670 and 1740 pevsner dates it to about 1700
41][42]a detail of the hall screen
the hall has been said to be among the most impressive of all the oxford college halls with its fine panelling austere ceiling and its notable paintings
46 like the chapel it was largely built by griffith powell between 1613 and 1620 and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620
44 pevsner noted the elaborately decorated columns of the screen installed in 1634 and the dragons along the frieze and said that it was one of the earliest examples in oxford of panelling using four l shapes around a centre
36][47 in 1741 and 1742 the oak beamed roof was covered with plaster to make rooms in the roof space
48][49 pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall which contains the college crest as large and rich
50 the hall contains a portrait of elizabeth i as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors
51
there are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors charles i by anthony van dyck and charles ii by sir peter lely
52]second quadrangle the dutch gables around the top of the buildings in the second quadrangle in 1640 francis mansell appointed principal in 1630 began construction of a second quadrangle with buildings along the north and south sides further work was interrupted by the english civil war
53][54 work began again in 1676 and the library now the fellows library was completed by 1679
38][55 under jonathan edwards principal from 1688 to 1712 further rooms were built to complete the quadrangle the project was completed just after his death in 1712
38 pevsner described the second quadrangle as a uniform composition noting the regular fenestration by windows with round arched lights their hood moulds forming a continuous frieze
50 the dutch gables have ogee sides and semi circular pediments
50 the writer simon jenkins said that the quadrangle has the familiar oxford tudor windows and decorative dutch gables crowding the skyline like welsh dragons teeth and lightened by exuberant flower boxes
56]the fellows library contains bookcases decorated with strapwork dating from about 1628 which were used in an earlier library in the college
50 hardy 's opinion was that if only it had an open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling it would be one of the most picturesque college libraries
41][57 another author said in 1914 after the provision of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle that it was one of the most charming of oxford libraries and one of the least frequented
58 it holds 11,000 antiquarian printed books and houses many of the college 's rare texts including a greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by philipp melanchthon and others much of the library of the scholar and philosopher lord herbert of cherbury and 17th century volumes by robert boyle and sir isaac newton
59][60]third quadrangle the third quadrangle from the steps of the old members building looking east the ship street entrance is through the archway on the left the spire in the distance is the chapel of exeter college
the long but narrow third quadrangle adjoins ship street on the north of the site and to the west of the garden of the principal 's lodgings where the college has owned some land since its foundation
in the 18th century this was home to the college stables
a fire in 1904 led to the demolition of the stables and the gateway to ship street
61 replacement buildings adjoining ship street effectively creating a third quadrangle for the college were constructed between 1906 and 1908
62 it contained the college 's science laboratories now closed and a new gate tower as well as further living accommodation and a library for students known as the meyricke library after a major donor there had been an undergraduate library in the second quadrangle since 1865 known as the meyricke library from 1882 onwards
61][62]the old members building which contains a music room 24 study bedrooms and some lecture rooms was built between 1969 and 1971
50][63 it was built after a fundraising appeal to old members to mark the college 's quatercentenary and was opened by the prince of wales in 1971
28 the fellows garden is between the old members building and the rear of the rooms on the west side of the second quadrangle
in 2002 a two year project to rebuild the property above the college owned shops on ship street was completed
as part of the work the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new junior common room jcr to replace the common room in the second quadrangle which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students
64]other buildings the college purchased 10 acres 0.040 km2 0.016 sq mi of land in east oxford near the cowley road in 1903 for use as a sports ground
29 residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 thelwall house rebuilt in 1998 with additions between 1988 and 1990 hugh price house and leoline jenkins house
a further development known as hazel court after alfred hazel principal 1925–1944 was built in 2000 bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135
29][65]donations from edwin stevens an old member of the college enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north oxford on the woodstock road named stevens close in his honour
29 the college also owns a number of houses on ship street which are used for student accommodation
66 it has purchased a further site in ship street at a cost of £ 1.8 m which will be converted at a projected cost of £ 5.5 m to provide 31 student rooms with en suite facilities a 100 seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms
67][68 the ship street centre was officially opened by the chancellor of the university of oxford lord patten of barnes on 25 september 2010

88]the college formerly had a category of missionary fellows known as leoline fellows after their founder leoline jenkins a former principal
in his will in 1685 he stated that it is but too obvious that the persons in holy orders employed in his majesty 's fleet at sea and foreign plantations are too few
 to address this he established two fellowships at jesus college whose holders should serve as clergy in any of his majesty 's fleets or in his majesty 's plantations under the direction of the lord high admiral and the bishop of london respectively
the last of these frederick de winton was appointed in 1876 and held his fellowship until his death in 1932
this category was abolished in 1877 by the oxford and cambridge universities commission without prejudice to the rights of existing holders such as de winton
89 another category of fellowship that was abolished in the 19th century was that of the king charles i fellows founded by king charles in 1636 and tenable by natives of the channel islands in an attempt by him to reclaim the channel islands from the extreme calvinism which characterised them

124]jesus college boat club commonly abbreviated to jcbc is the rowing club for members of the college
the club was formed in 1835 but rowing at the college predates the foundation of the club a boat from the college was involved in the earliest recorded races between college crews at oxford in 1815 when it competed against a crew from brasenose college
125 these may have been the only two colleges who had boats racing at that time and the brasenose boat was usually victorious
126 neither the men 's nor the women 's 1st viiis have been head of the river during eights week the main college races but the women 's 1st viii was head of the river in the spring races torpids between 1980 and 1983
127][128][129][130 jesus boats have also had other successful seasons the 1896 jesus college boat had a reputation of being one of the faster boats in the university,[131 and the women 's 1st viii of 1993 won their blades in the first divisions of both torpids and eights week an achievement that led to the crew being described in the jesus college record as vying not just for the college team of the decade but perhaps for the team of the last three decades in any sport
132]a number of college members have rowed for the university against cambridge university in the boat race and the women 's boat race
barney williams a canadian rower who studied at the college won a silver medal in rowing at the 2004 summer olympics and participated in the boat race in 2005 and 2006
133 other students who rowed while at the college have achieved success in other fields including john sankey who became lord chancellor alwyn williams who became bishop of durham and maurice jones who became principal of st david 's college lampeter
134][135 another college rower james page was appointed secretary of the amateur rowing association and coached both the oxford and cambridge university boat clubs
136]the college boathouse which is shared with the boat club of keble college is in christ church meadow on the isis as the river thames is called in oxford
it dates from 1964 and replaced a moored barge used by spectators and crew members
the last college barge had been purchased from one of the livery companies of the city of london in 1911
it is now a floating restaurant further down the thames at richmond and for some years was painted in the college colours of green and white
137]welsh connection late 19th century stained glass in the chapel showing st david the patron saint of wales education in wales had been stimulated by the foundation of grammar schools during the reigns of henry viii and edward vi
king henry viii grammar school in abergavenny and christ college brecon were established in the 1540s and friars school bangor dates from 1557
138 however despite the numbers of welsh students coming to oxford university as a result there was no special provision for welshmen before 1571
despite the links with wales that hugh price and many of the founding fellows had neither the 1571 charter nor any of the later charters limited entry to the college to welshmen
139 nevertheless the college students were predominantly welsh from the outset,[140 and the college became the pinnacle of the academic ambition of the young men of wales
141 many of the fellows in the past were welsh since when new fellowships were created by benefactions often by people of welsh descent there was frequently a stipulation that the recipients would be related to the donor or come from a specified part of wales
these specific limitations were removed as part of reforms of oxford university during the 19th century
between 1571 and 1915 only one principal francis howell 1657–1660 was not from wales or of welsh descent
139]jesus still has a particular association with wales and is often referred to as the welsh college
the college is home to the university 's professor of celtic and a specialist celtic library in addition to the college 's normal library
meyrick scholarships from the bequest of edmund meyrick in 1713 are awarded for academic merit where the student is a native of wales or the child of a native of wales able to speak welsh or was educated for the last three years of secondary school in wales
142]the college 's undergraduate gossip sheet is entitled the sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about welsh people 's supposed penchant for sheep
furthermore the welshness of the college is self perpetuating as welsh students will often apply to jesus because it is seen as the welsh college
old members recall the college having a majority of welsh members until well into the 20th century;[143 today however around 15 of undergraduates come from wales
144 for comparison residents of wales comprise just under 5 of the united kingdom population 2.9 million[145 out of a total of 58.8 million[146 at the time of the 2001 census
in modern times the welsh roots of the college come to the fore most prominently on saint david 's day
the feast is marked by a choral evensong in the chapel decorated for the occasion with daffodils
the service including music is conducted entirely in welsh despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language
it is generally well attended by members of the welsh community in oxford
144 the college 's annual st. david 's day dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of sir watkin williams wynn 's pudding
the name recalls the welsh politician and prominent jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century
147]silverwarethe college 's collection of silverware includes a silver gilt punch bowl presented by sir watkin williams wynn in 1732
148 the bowl which weighs more than 200 ounces 5.7 kg and holds 10 imperial gallons 45 l was used at a dinner held in the radcliffe camera in 1814 to celebrate what was supposed to be the final defeat of napoleon
those present at the dinner included the tsar the king of prussia blücher metternich the prince regent the duke of york and the duke of wellington
149 there is a college tradition that the bowl will be presented to anyone who can meet two challenges
the first is to put arms around the bowl at its widest point the second is to drain the bowl of strong punch
the bowl measures 5 feet 2 inches 1.57 m at its widest point and so the first challenge has only been accomplished rarely the second challenge has not been met
150]coat of arms the college 's coat of arms in heraldic terminology is vert three stags trippant argent attired or
151][152 the arms are not those of hugh price
153 his arms according to their depiction in the margins of his will were gules red a chevron ermine between three fleurs des lis
154
the arms were not granted or authorised by the college of arms but the length of time for which they have been used has given them a prescriptive authority
154]the earliest depiction of the arms was thought to be about 1590 in a document held by the college of arms which refers to the stags appearing on a blue in heraldic terms azure background but subsequent examination of this document by peter donoghue bluemantle pursuivant shows that the arms were added c.1680
the first known appearance of the arms is therefore on john speed ’s map of oxfordshire in 1605 with a blue field
the green field made its appearance by 1619 in an armorial quarry painted by one of the van linge brothers
155
the green background became generally but not universally used by the 1730s still appearing as horizontal hatchings indicating azure were in use on bookplates for the college library as late as 1761
156]there are similarities with the arms of lincoln college oxford where one of the elements consists of three golden stags statant standing still this was derived from the coat of arms of lincoln 's so called second founder thomas rotherham
152 it was once claimed that jesus had stolen the stags from lincoln,[157 but the counter argument from an antiquarian with close lincoln connections was that the origins of each were distinct
158 one suggestion by paul langford the rector of lincoln college is that jesus college continued the arms adopted by a theological college founded by rotherham in his home town jesus college rotherham which had been suppressed in the time of edward vi
152]the arms of maud green lady parr mother of catherine parr the last of the six wives of henry viii and stepmother to elizabeth i were of three stags on an azure background and this became one of the elements of the arms of catherine parr on her marriage
159 her sister anne parr married william 1st earl of pembroke whose grandson the 3rd earl also called william became the first visitor of the college in 1622
maud green 's arms are depicted in plasterwork from about 1592 at powis castle owned by a kinsman of the earls
one writer has suggested that the college may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading welsh families of the day
154]this latter theory is not heraldically tenable as the quarters in an achievement after the first and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses can not meaningfully exist on their own to represent the person who now quarters them
it is more probable then that the arms of the college really are those of archbishop rotherham and were assumed to be those of the college by john speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map
lawrence hall in ship street was given to rotherham in 1476 and leased to jesus in 1572
it may well have displayed the archbishop ’s arms in its structure as did the building on the south side of the front quad of lincoln which he completed
these arms for jesus college could not be confused with those of lincoln as that college since 1574 already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by richard lee portcullis pursuivant in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to or gold and their attitude to statant
160]gracesgrace is said by a scholar of the college at formal hall the second more elaborate sitting of dinner
161]before dinner nos miseri et egentes homines pro cibo quem ad alimoniam corporis sanctificatum nobis es largítus ut eo utamur grati tibi deus omnipotens pater caelestis gratias reverenter agimus simul obsecrantes ut cibum angelorum verum panem caelestem verbum dei aeternum dominum nostrum iesum christum nobis impertiaris ut illo mens nostra pascatur et per carnem et sanguinem eius foveamur alamur et corróboremur
162]translation we wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks almighty god heavenly father for the food which thou hast sanctified and bestowed for the sustenance of the body so that we may use it thankfully at the same time we beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels the true bread of heaven the eternal word of god jesus christ our lord so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished sustained and strengthened
163]after dinner quandoquidem nos domine donis tuis omnipotens et misericors deus exsatiasti effice ut posthac quid per nos fieri aut secus velis diligenter observemus atque illud animo sincero effectum praestemus per iesum christum dominum nostrum
versicle domine salvam fac reginam
response et exaudi nos in die qua invocaverimus te
deus in cuius manu sunt corda regum qui es humilium consolator et fidelium fortitudo et protector omnium in te sperantium da reginae nostrae elizabethae populoque christiano triumphum virtutis tuae scienter excolere ut per te semper reparentur ad gloriam per christum dominum nostrum
162]translation
since o lord almighty and most merciful god thou hast satisfied us with thy gifts ensure from henceforth that we may diligently regard what thou wishest to be done or left undone by us and cause this to be effected with sincere heart through jesus christ our lord versicle o lord keep the queen safe
response and hear us in the day in which we call on thee
god in whose hands are the hearts of kings who art the consoler of the humble and the protector of all who hope in thee grant to our queen elizabeth and to the christian people to celebrate wisely the triumph of thy goodness so that they may be always renewed to glory through thee through jesus christ our lord
