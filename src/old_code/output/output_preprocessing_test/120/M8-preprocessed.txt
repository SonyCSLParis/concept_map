forest school forest school is an independent school on the edge of epping forest in walthamstow ne london
the school occupies a large campus around a terrace of georgian houses with nineteenth century additions
until the early eighteenth century the essex parishes of walthamstow and leyton were largely rural in character with a landscape dominated by marshland farmland and forest
georgian walthamstow was a far cry from the modern borough of waltham forest and a contemporary writer described it as“one of the largest and handsomest suburban villages near the metropolis
not surprisingly the large families of the wealthy inhabitants led to an increased demand for good schools particularly for boys in both walthamstow and leyton parish
in 1820 there were about five private schools in walthamstow and almost as many in leyton
the most famous was probably dr cogan ’s school for the sons of gentlemen at essex hall walthamstow
it was here that benjamin disraeli was a pupil until expelled for fighting
