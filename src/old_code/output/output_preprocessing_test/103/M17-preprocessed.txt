washing buddha 's faceby philip shenon;published june 21 1992in the cool bluish mist of the cambodian dawn the hand carved mountain of stone that is angkor wat appears first in silhouette the temple 's massive central towers dwarfing even the tallest of the surrounding jungle trees
down the dirt road leading to the temple the dense grove of banyan and silk cotton trees gives way to a moat 4,800 feet long wider than stretches of the mekong river crossed by a stone causeway that eight centuries ago served as the parade route for elephants that on festival days were draped with khmer silks and thick ropes of gold
beyond the water is the great temple itself
angkor wat overwhelms the eye rising in three massive square tiers each a walled sandstone gallery sheltering thousands of square feet of bas relief that are among the greatest artistic treasures of the ancient world
soaring more than 200 feet above the jungle floor are the five central towers designed it is thought to resemble lotus buds close to bloom
as the sun rises over the cambodian jungle and the first rays of sunlight strike the ancient stone a 20th century dispute over this 12th century wonder becomes clear
angkor wat is now half black and half white
angkor wat the largest religious monument on earth the grandest architectural achievement of an empire that once stretched across indochina the most important symbol of unity in a nation that has known nothing but war or genocide for a generation is being scrubbed down and partly rebuilt by a team of indian archeologists and engineers
armed with hard brushes and buckets of a solution of ammonia and water hundreds of unskilled khmer laborers working at the indians direction vigorously rub over the delicate stonework as if it were a dirty kitchen floor
other cambodian workers empty trowels of cement into cracks large and small in the ancient sandstone
small knots of khmer laborers use steel hoists to reassemble stone entryways that began to tumble down centuries ago
the indian team 's restoration work begun in 1986 and scheduled to go on for at least two years more has sparked one of the angriest debates of modern art conservation
depending on the expert asked the question angkor wat is either being restored to a lost glory or is being irreversibly damaged
the indians insist they are removing vegetation that is slowly eating away at the monument while carefully rebuilding collapsed stone structures
their critics say that the indians are using outdated cleaning techniques and dangerous abrasive chemicals to scrub away detail on some of the best preserved statuary of the ancient world while pouring cement with reckless abandon on a structure that was originally built without mortar
the furious dispute over the restoration of angkor wat is part of a larger argument among scholars and diplomats over how and whether outside nations should cooperate in preserving the complex of more than 70 major temples spread across 25 square miles of the ancient khmer capital
the united nations through its educational scientific and cultural organization or unesco is trying to come up with a blueprint for conserving all of the great stone monuments of angkor
unesco 's hope is to save the temples from the ravages of nature of looting and of unrestrained tourism
but its work has been hampered by shortage of money and by bickering among outside experts over who should do the work and who should serve on an international advisory panel that is being formed to counsel the cambodian government on the restoration
unesco 's immediate goal is to secure for angkor wat and the other angkor temples a place on its world heritage list a designation that would allow the united nations to assume a more formal role in overseeing and raising money for the restoration work
while the angkor temples are indisputably worthy of inclusion on the list they can not be added unless the cambodian government offers up a formal highly detailed plan for maintaining and policing angkor
this government is in such chaos it 's hard to imagine them coming up with a grocery list let alone a detailed plan to restore an archeological wonder like angkor says a western diplomat in phnom penh
nevertheless unesco 's local representative in cambodia richard a. engelhardt an american archeologist is patiently working with cambodian government officials in hopes of submitting the plan later this year
pich keo the director of cambodia 's national museum is one of the few cambodian experts on angkor the ancient capital of the khmer empire and home to angkor wat to have survived the khmer rouge terror of the 1970 's
pich keo says he appreciates the fact that in the early 1980 's when phnom penh made an international appeal for help in restoring the angkor monuments after a decade of neglect only india responded offering the assistance of its 130 year old archeological survey one of the world 's largest and most experienced art conservation services
but he makes clear that he is appalled at what the indians have done to angkor wat
there are areas of the temple he says where the stone has clearly been damaged by the restoration efforts and he fears what will become of the monument over time because of the indian team 's mysterious mix of chemical cleaners and preservatives
i see this work and i think no good he says
cambodia is only now emerging from the shadow of the nightmare years of the pol pot regime and of the more than 12 years of civil war that followed its ouster
in the flawed restoration of the greatest of all khmer temples pich keo says there is a disquieting metaphor for the multibillion dollar international effort launched last fall to bring a lasting peace to his tortured nation
angkor wat is a symbol of cambodia 's greatness pich keo explains
but what happens at angkor wat he says can also be a symbol of our disaster
 angkor wat was meant to be heaven on earth
it was the dream of a megalomaniacal king suryavarman ii who enslaved tens of thousands of his subjects in order to build at angkor wat an earthly replica of the hindu cosmos
the moat around the temple was designed to represent the great oceans while the tiered walls represent mountain ranges separating continents
the five central towers symbolize mount meru the olympus of the hindu gods
erected by some ancient michelangelo it is grander than anything left to us by greece or rome wrote henri mouhot the french naturalist who discovered angkor wat in 1861
his discovery was the start of france 's century long romance with angkor
before the french were forced to leave cambodia in the early 1970 's because of the fighting generations of french scholars had lived at angkor working to conserve the temples of the great khmer kings
that indian archeologists would want to take up the work of their french counterparts is not surprising
as an historical and cultural artifact angkor wat wat means temple is the asian equivalent of the great pyramids of egypt or chartres in france
it is in fact a contemporary of the french cathedral
for india angkor wat holds special significance since it is a tribute to the abiding influence of indian culture on its asian neighbors
at the time of suryavarman the state religion of the khmer empire was hinduism a legacy of the peaceful indian traders who centuries before had traveled to cambodia in search of spices and gems
most of all the indian restoration of angkor wat was born of cold war geopolitics
in 1978 vietnam had invaded cambodia ending the genocidal rule of the chinese backed khmer rouge
taking their cue from the united states virtually all the non communist countries in the world shunned cambodia as a vietnamese puppet state
the exception was india which has close ties to vietnam in part because the two nations share a traditional adversary china
it became the only major nation outside the soviet bloc to recognize the phnom penh government
the indians were given their pick of angkor monuments to restore and they chose the largest and most important angkor wat
we were very clear that we wanted to do the work at angkor wat says m. s. nagaraja rao an archeologist trained in india and at cambridge who was then the director general of the archeological survey
india is emotionally attached to the monument
there is so much indian inspiration
 the central structure of angkor wat he discovered had not been badly damaged during the khmer rouge years with the notable exception of several bullet holes left in the temple walls by soldiers who had used the national landmark for target practice
but the khmer rouge had at the same time done almost nothing to conserve angkor wat
the temple had been left to the ravages of the fecund all devouring jungle for more than a decade and it was overgrown with vegetation that the indians describe as a type of stone cancer
in april 1986 india and cambodia reached agreement on the restoration with india providing the technical expertise archeologists architects engineers masons and chemists in teams of about 15 that rotate annually
the cambodians provide the laborers and many of the materials
the project 's cost to india has been estimated at about $ 3 million
the pact created an uproar in the small worlds of archeology and stone conservation
in the most sacred place the stone sanctuary where eight centuries ago the high priests of the khmer empire congregated at dawn to pray before the gilded shrine of the hindu god vishnu there is now only the sound of the gentle jungle breeze and of the scrubbing
dozens of young cambodian women sit precariously on metal scaffolding set against a massive 40 foot stone stairway leading to the pyramidical sanctuary of angkor wat
some of them clutch bundles of thin stiff coconut wood sticks bound by a rubber band others hold wooden handled brushes with firm plastic bristles
and they are rubbing down the stone hard
every few minutes the women pause to throw cups of an ammonia and water solution against the stairway waiting a moment for the ammonia to seep into the porous stone killing and dislodging a velvety coat of black moss
they begin to scrub again slowly revealing the pinkish white stone beneath
a large ammonia scented puddle forms beneath the scaffolding and it is thick with the pulverized vegetation scrubbed from the stone and with grains of the stone itself
like ruins throughout the tropics angkor wat is covered with layers of humidity loving vegetation black moss whitish spots of fungus leafy plants and even small trees that eat away at the surface with the weak acids they produce or that grow so thick that the stone simply cracks open
using a variety of chemicals as well as the basic ammonia and water the indians are trying to kill the vegetation and scrub it off filling the cracks that are revealed with cement
the chemicals we use are not controversial says v. r. mangiraj who has led the three man team of indian chemists working at angkor wat this year
he watches as dozens of khmer women their clothes drenched with the cleaning solution scamper up and down the metal scaffolding to wash the delicately carved walls in a shadowy enclosure known as the gallery of the 1,000 buddhas
buddhism eventually replaced hinduism as the dominant khmer religion
archeologists do n't like chemicals adds mangiraj pulling off a white cap and wiping his brow against the jungle heat
they think that the vegetation forms some sort of protective patina but they are wrong
the vegetation destroys the stone and must be removed
 to a layman watching the indians bravely toil away at angkor wat despite oppressive heat and wretched working conditions there is little question of the indian team 's dedication to the project
the cosmetic change is obvious and many visitors say an improvement
but also obvious is the damage that is being done to the stone
few of the cambodian laborers pay attention to their work and they seem neither to notice nor to care when fingernail size chunks of the carved sandstone give way and tumble down the stone mountain
the indian team insists that it keeps watch on the workers to prevent damage but the khmers outnumber the indians by more than 25 to one making close supervision impossible
there are more than 400 laborers
a layman visiting the sight is also left to wonder about the need for cleaning the ancient stone since the vegetation will inevitably return
dark patches have already reappeared on walls bleached in 1988 the result of a shortage of chemical preservatives that year
some experts who recently visited the site say they have detected serious damage
this is housekeeping not conservation says eleanor mannikka an art historian at the university of michigan who visited angkor last year and came away outraged
the ancient stone is being eroded
 patrick matthiesen a london art dealer who trained in stone conservation with the victoria and albert museum in london has visited angkor twice since the indians began their work
he says he was horrified by the chemical washing
he recalls one relief that he says had lost all definition because of the scrubbing
quite clearly it was the chemicals that had attacked the stone and removed the whole surface as it was rubbed he says
i tried to photograph it but there was so little definition left it was futile
 he worries about the long term effect as the fungicides and preservatives settle into the stone
it is a question that can not be answered for now since the indians are keeping the full list of chemicals a secret
the rumors about the indians restoration work began to spread almost as soon as the first indian team arrived in cambodia in 1986
rumors were all that most archeologists and other scholars had to go on since the war raging between the vietnamese backed government and the rebel forces made travel to angkor difficult sometimes dangerous
the most feverishly circulated rumor was that the indians had washed down the temple with agent orange the herbicide that has been linked to cancer in american veterans of the vietnam war
the indians deny it
the dispute over the indians work reflects a larger division within archeology and art conservation
it can be split roughly into two schools of thought those who believe a monument should be returned as much as possible to its original appearance and those in the so called do no harm school who believe the goal is only to prevent further decay
the french who oversaw the conservation of angkor for most of the century fall today into the latter category
at ta prohm one of the largest of the angkor monuments the french abandoned conservation altogether and left the temple to the elements as a sort of object lesson in the battle between stone and jungle
the scene of creepers and thick tree trunks entwined violently with the stone walls is something out of indiana jones and it makes ta prohm today the most romantic and in many ways the most beautiful of the angkor temples
the archeological survey of india is admired for its scholarship and many of its senior archeologists and stone conservators are ranked among the best in the world
but it is a massive bureaucracy made up of thousands of employees and others at the survey are not so widely respected
the organization is sometimes criticized for taking conservation too far for trying too often to make monuments look like new
there are disputes in india periodically over whether the survey has damaged fragile national treasures with restoration projects that were either too ambitious or relied on techniques that were insufficiently tested
i have many friends in india and i want to keep them says jacques dumarcay a french architect long affiliated with the ecole francaise d'extreme orient
but he ca n't find anything friendly to say about the indians work at angkor wat
i do n't like it he says
barkur narasimhaiah the archeologist who is head of this year 's 15 member indian team says criticism of the indian work is misplaced and he and his colleagues wonder how much of the criticism is based on jealousy
the cleaning and restoration techniques he says have been tested on the great monuments of india and proved safe
as long as this monument stands our work will stand he says brushing sandstone dust from the pajamalike indian style trousers he wears on his daily inspections
in 1989 unesco decided to find out for itself what was going on at angkor wat and dispatched yoshiaki ishizawa director of asian cultural studies at sophia university in tokyo
ishizawa returned from cambodia with a report in which he described elements of the indian work as unsuitable and even primitive and urged unesco to step in
his view is shared by other specialists who describe the indians work as often slapdash
ishizawa for example found that to deal with water drainage problems in one portion of the temple the indians had dug a large hole into the soft sandstone
other stone specialists and engineers say they are startled by the indians liberal use of cement
the amount of cement is crazy says jean e. launay a french engineer who worked at angkor a quarter century ago
the cement ages at a different rate than the sandstone creating a jarring two tone effect over time
in some instances the indians have replaced original stone pillars with crude concrete replicas even though specialists say the originals could have been repaired and restored
the cambodian laborers criticize the work as well
we are not doing a good job says one worker as he uses a mud encrusted wooden stick to mix a bucket of gray cement
we are just told to put cement when we see a hole
there are uneducated teen agers doing this work who do not appreciate the monument
they do not know what is ugly and what is beautiful
so their work is ugly
 the cement masks what many archeologists and art conservators believe is the largest problem at angkor wat a foundation of sand and reddish laterite stone that goes spongy in the annual monsoons
there is an endemic failure in the structure which you can blame on the khmers of the 12th century says john sanday a british architect who is a consultant to the world monuments fund a new york based conservation group
there comes a time in any old building when it reaches a point where something desperate has to be done
angkor wat is reaching that critical stage
 launay the french engineer detected serious shifting of the stones when he worked at angkor in the 1960 's
he proposed recently that whole galleries of angkor wat be taken apart and reassembled atop a new cement foundation a project that could easily cost tens of millions of dollars
the indians say it is unnecessary that the archeological survey tested the foundation in the early 1980 's and found it solid
there is no danger to the foundation narasimhaiah contends
we tested and we know
 asked about french architectural drawings from 20 years ago showing dangerous faults in the foundations he replies the french had misunderstood
 french scientists say they have asked to see the indians research reports on the foundation
they say they never received a reply
if the tools used by the indians at angkor wat it is the chemicals that most frighten many stone conservators
the indian chemists store their supplies in the temple 's uppermost sanctuary in the shaded colonnaded sandstone gallery perhaps 20 feet high that once held a grand statue of vishnu and that today contains a towering wooden image of the buddha
there are six small stone steps leading to the shrine they are worn down from the bare feet of centuries of visiting faithful and they are covered with the chemists paraphernalia plastic tubes funnels and bottles fungicide sprayers and a metal lock box
the smell of ammonia from black plastic jugs a few feet away overwhelms the sweet incense that is burning at the buddha 's feet
western art conservators tend to reject the claim of the indian team that it is using sodium hydroxide only to test acid samples
what seems more likely the conservators say is that the indians are using sodium hydroxide as a dangerous shortcut for cleaning stone
in 1988 japanese scholars obtained a partial list of the chemicals
frank d. preusser an art conservator at the getty conservation institute in marina del rey calif. who holds a doctorate in chemistry says the list contained chemicals that were outdated ineffective and had the potential of doing serious damage to the stone
zinc silicofluoride a preservative for instance can create a thick surface layer on stone that has a tendency to slough off taking stone with it
 what is worse says preusser is the threat to the health of workers using the chemicals which include sodium pentachlorophenate a fungicide toxic methyl alcohol and benzene a carcinogen preusser who spent a week at angkor in march says he witnessed dozens of khmer workers applying a noxious layer of chemical preservatives to the stone
they were not provided with gloves or masks or any other sort of protection
it was very disturbing he says recalling how the cambodians stood in pools of the chemical solvents
these women were just sitting there in the full heat breathing in those vapors
no one seemed to be concerned for their safety
 the relationship between the indians and the cambodian laborers is poor in part a reflection of the difficult working conditions that both face at angkor wat
for the indians angkor is a hardship post and few volunteer to return for a second seven month tour
while in cambodia the indians have almost no contact with their families in india
medical care is essentially nonexistent
the indians permit only women to do the actual scrubbing of angkor wat an effort they say to protect the temple 's delicate stonework
because the girls have weaker arms there 's no problem for the stone says ravi kant an indian chemist
away from the indian team many of the women laborers a large number are teen agers say they are frightened by their work
the chemicals make your hands feel hot and they turn red says a 17 year old cambodian
why should they be so red
but the laborers say they are dependent on the salaries they are paid by the phnom penh government 450 riel about 50 cents a day
it is a reasonable salary in a nation in which the per capita income is about $ 170 a year
the indians working at angkor wat do not speak khmer and none of the cambodian workers speak more than a few words of english or hindi so there is little communication apart from hand signals
furthermore no effort is being made to train the cambodians to take over detailed restoration work after the indians leave even though some sort of training program is badly needed during the anti intellectual purges of the khmer rouge most of cambodia 's archeologists and art historians were killed or driven from the country
in phally a lanky 31 year old cambodian working with the indian team as an english khmer translator recalls how one morning in 1977 his father who had worked at angkor conservation for 20 years was taken into custody by khmer rouge soldiers and placed in chains and dragged away
i could not yell out because the khmer rouge would have killed me says in phally who to this day has no idea why his father was arrested
i never saw my father again
 while fighting rages on in areas of central cambodia the civil war is formally over ended on paper by a peace settlement brokered last fall by the united nations
the peace process may be fragile but it has benefited angkor wat and the other monuments of the ancient khmer empire by allowing foreign archaeologists and art historians to visit freely for the first time in more than two decades
the french may soon be back at angkor in force
they have been invited by the cambodians to complete work on the baphuon an 11th century temple that french conservators were restoring when they fled in the early 1970 's
japanese conservators are planning to restore a smaller 12th century temple
the task of organizing the international conservation effort at angkor falls largely to richard engelhardt the unesco representative
unesco is also assisting in the selection of an international advisory board to review restoration proposals and prevent what engelhardt describes as a disneyland effect in which each donor nation carries out its own interpretation of what the angkor monuments should look like
it could also he says prevent a repetition of the sort of controversy created by the indian project
yet the creation of the advisory board has been hampered by angry feuding among archeologists and art historians over its membership and its authority
the french do n't want the japanese on the board and the japanese certainly do n't want the french says a diplomat involved in the discussions
and the french and the japanese do n't want the indians
 the board will report to cambodia 's newly restored head of state prince norodom sihanouk who before he was forced into exile in 1970 was a regular visitor to angkor
even as the united nations prepares to spend more than $ 2 billion on the peacekeeping operation engelhardt 's job is to raise a few million dollars to begin surveying the monuments at angkor and he hopes to begin educational programs that one day might allow cambodians to take over the preservation work themselves
among his priorities is the creation of a professional force of guards to prevent the still widespread looting
each month two or three major pieces of statuary disappear from angkor wat and the other temples often stolen with the help of cambodian guards bribed with the equivalent of $ 5 or $ 10
security is also needed to deal with the growing number of tourists
although the cambodian government has no reliable figures on tourism the daily flights between phnom penh and siem reap the cambodian city nearest to angkor are usually jammed with foreign sightseers and there is talk of charter flights from bangkok to siem reap within a year
although he praises the indians commitment to restoring angkor engelhardt describes their work as a cosmetic quick fix that appears to be removing some of the stone 's delicate outer layer
he worries too that the indians are not dealing with what could prove to be catastrophic structural flaws
engelhardt 's phnom penh office overlooks the royal palace from the top floor of a graceful turn of the century french colonial town house that has an ugly past
because it was one of the few buildings in the capital with a basement the house is said to have been used by the khmer rouge as a torture center in the late 1970 's
aware of what went on two floors below his elegantly decorated office engelhardt acknowledges his fear that angkor wat and the nation it symbolizes could be plunged into another generation of neglect and violence
in the end he says angkor wat will survive whatever damage may result from a flawed restoration attempt
the better question is how and whether the great stone temple would survive another round of a vicious civil war
no one he says wants to take that risk
