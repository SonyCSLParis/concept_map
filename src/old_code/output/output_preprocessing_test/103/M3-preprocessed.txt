travelour visit to the largest religious monument in the world angkor wat
now i understand people from all corners of the world travel miles to see angkor wat
this awe inspiring structure is unique and beyond stunning
many go there at dawn to catch the sunrise spectacle which is apparently a mind blowing once in a lifetime experience
you just have to wake up at 4 am in order to get there in time and get a good spot
angkor wat is photogenic but inorder to get those good shots try to avoid the crowds by visiting earlier rather than later in the day
it is also nice and cool hence hiking is less tiring and more gratifying
there are direct flights from bangkok to siem reap
so if you are visiting bangkok and have a day or two to spare
go visit the angkor temples
focus on the major ones bayon angkor wat and ta prohm
we did bayon and angkor wat in a day but with comfortable walking shoes it is possible to do all the three of them
hubby and i had an amazing time
we highly recommend visiting angkor wat
it is the heart and soul of cambodia
if you have nâ€™t been there then your trip is incomplete
