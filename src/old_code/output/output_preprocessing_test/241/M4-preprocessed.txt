the gray area is the later timurid empire
the mongol empire mongolian mongolyn ezent güren or m ikh mongol uls 1206–1405 was the largest contiguous empire and the second largest empire overall in world history
at its greatest extent it stretched from moscow to the south china sea
it emerged from the unification of mongol and turkic tribes in modern day mongolia and grew through invasions after genghis khan had been proclaimed ruler of all mongols in 1206
by 1279 the mongol empire covered over 33,000,000 km² 12,741,000 sq mi 22 of the earth 's total land area
it held sway over a population of over 100 million people
however by that time the empire had already partly fragmented with the golden horde and the chagatai khanate being de facto independent and refusing to accept kublai khan as khagan
by the time of kublai khan 's death with no accepted khagan in existence the mongol empire became divided into four separate khanates

he quickly came into conflict with the jin dynasty empire of the jurchens and the western xia of the tanguts in northern china
under the provocation of the muslim khwarezmid empire he moved into central asia as well devastating transoxiana and eastern persia then raiding into kievan rus a predecessor state of russia belarus and ukraine and the caucasus
before dying genghis khan divided his empire among his sons and immediate family but as custom made clear it remained the joint property of the entire imperial family who along with the mongol aristocracy constituted the ruling class

organizationmilitary setup the mongol military organization was simple but effective
it was based on an old tradition of the steppe which was a decimal system known in iranian cultures since achaemenid persia and later the army was built up from squads of ten men each called an arbat ten arbats constituted a company of a hundred called a zuut ten zuuts made a regiment of a thousand called myanghan and ten myanghans would then constitute a regiment of ten thousand tumen which is the equivalent of a modern division
unlike other mobile only warriors such as the xiongnu or the huns the mongols were very comfortable in the art of the siege
they were very careful to recruit artisans and military talents from the cities they conquered and along with a group of experienced chinese engineers and bombardier corps they were experts in building the trebuchet xuanfeng catapults and other machines with which they could lay siege to fortified positions
these were effectively used in the successful european campaigns under general subutai
these weapons may be built on the spot using immediate local resources such as nearby trees
within a battle mongol forces used extensive coordination of combined arms forces
though they were famous for their horse archers their lance forces were equally skilled and just as essential to their success
mongol forces also used their engineers in battle
they used siege engines and rockets to disrupt enemy formations confused enemy forces with smoke and used smoke to isolate portions of an enemy force while destroying that force to prevent their allies from sending aid
the army 's discipline distinguished mongol soldiers from their peers
the forces under the command of the mongol empire were generally trained organized and equipped for mobility and speed
to maximize mobility mongol soldiers were relatively lightly armored compared to many of the armies they faced
in addition soldiers of the mongol army functioned independently of supply lines considerably speeding up army movement
skillful use of couriers enabled these armies to maintain contact with each other and with their higher leaders
discipline was inculcated in nerge traditional hunts as reported by juvayni
these hunts were distinct from hunts in other cultures which were the equivalent to small unit actions
mongol forces would spread out on line surrounding an entire region and drive all of the game within that area together
the goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all
all military campaigns were preceded by careful planning reconnaissance and gathering of sensitive information relating to the enemy territories and forces
the success organization and mobility of the mongol armies permitted them to fight on several fronts at once
all males aged from 15 to 60 and capable of undergoing rigorous training were eligible for conscription into the army the source of honour in the tribal warrior tradition
another advantage of the mongols was their ability to traverse large distances even in debilitatingly cold winters in particular frozen rivers led them like highways to large urban conurbations on their banks
in addition to siege engineering the mongols were also adept at river work crossing the river sajó in spring flood conditions with thirty thousand cavalry in a single night during the battle of mohi april 1241 defeating the hungarian king bela iv
similarly in the attack against the muslim khwarezmshah a flotilla of barges was used to prevent escape on the river
law and governance the mongol empire was governed by a code of law devised by genghis called yassa meaning order or decree
a particular canon of this code was that the nobility shared much of the same hardship as the common man
it also imposed severe penalties e.g. the death penalty was decreed if the mounted soldier following another did not pick up something dropped from the mount in front
on the whole the tight discipline made the mongol empire extremely safe and well run european travelers were amazed by the organization and strict discipline of the people within the mongol empire
under yassa chiefs and generals were selected based on merit religious tolerance was guaranteed and thievery and vandalizing of civilian property was strictly forbidden
according to legend a woman carrying a sack of gold could travel safely from one end of the empire to another
the empire was governed by a non democratic parliamentary style central assembly called kurultai in which the mongol chiefs met with the great khan to discuss domestic and foreign policies
genghis also demonstrated a rather liberal and tolerant attitude to the beliefs of others and never persecuted people on religious grounds
this proved to be good military strategy as when he was at war with sultan muhammad of khwarezm other islamic leaders did not join the fight against genghis it was instead seen as a non holy war between two individuals
throughout the empire trade routes and an extensive postal system yam were created
many merchants messengers and travelers from china the middle east and europe used the system
genghis khan also created a national seal encouraged the use of a written alphabet in mongolia and exempted teachers lawyers and artists from taxes although taxes were heavy on all other subjects of the empire
at the same time any resistance to mongol rule was met with massive collective punishment
cities were destroyed and their inhabitants slaughtered if they defied mongol orders
religionspersian miniature showing ghazan 's conversion from buddhism to islam mongols were highly tolerant of most religions and typically sponsored several at the same time
at the time of genghis khan virtually every religion had found converts from buddhism to christianity and manichaeanism to islam
to avoid strife genghis khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom though he himself was a shamanist
under his administration all religious leaders were exempt from taxation and from public service
initially there were few formal places of worship because of the nomadic lifestyle
however under ögedei several building projects were undertaken in karakorum
along with palaces ogodei built houses of worship for the buddhist muslim christian and taoist followers
the dominant religion at that time was shamanism tengriism and buddhism although ogodei 's wife was a christian
later three of the four principle khanates embraced islam
buddhismogedei 's son and guyuk 's younger brother khoten kötön became the governor of ningxia and gansu
he launched a military campaign into tibet under the command of generals lichi and dhordha
the marauding mongols burned down tibetan monuments such as the reting monastery and the gyal temple in 1240
prince kötön was convinced that no power in the world exceeded the might of the mongols
however he believed that religion was necessary in the interests of the next life
thus he invited sakya pandita to mongolia
prince kötön was impressed by sakya pandita 's teachings
then he became the first known buddhist prince of mongol empire
khatun chabi influenced kublai to be converted to buddhism
she received the hévajra tantra initiations from phagspa and was very impressed
khubilai offered phagpa rule over the thirteen trikhors of tibet
on the completion of the second stage khubilai offered phagpa a white dharma conch shell and rule over all the three provinces of tibet
the third stage of the initiation was followed by khubilai taking a vow to renounce the yearly mass sacrifices of his chinese subjects
the sacrifices involved an annual ritual of throwing a large number of chinese subjects into lake miyou to check the growth of the chinese population in his empire
scientists says hulagu and abaqa were buddhists
and their religion flourished in persia until ghazan 's reign
tokhta of golden horde also encouraged lamas to settle in russia
christianitynestorian tombstone found in issyk kul dated 1312
some mongols had been proselytized by christian nestorians since about the 7th century and a few mongols were converted to catholicism esp
by john of montecorvino
some of the major christian figures among the mongols were sorghaghtani beki daughter in law of genghis khan and mother of the great khans möngke kublai hulagu and ariq boke sartaq khan of golden horde doquz khatun the mother of the ruler abaqa kitbuqa general of mongol forces in the levant who fought in alliance with christians
marital alliances with western powers also occurred as in the 1265 marriage of maria despina palaiologina daughter of emperor michael viii palaeologus with abaqa
the 13th century saw attempts at a franco mongol alliance with exchange of ambassadors and even military collaboration with european christians in the holy land
the nestorian mongol rabban bar sauma visited some european courts in 1287 1288
at the same time however islam began to take firm root amongst the mongols as those who embraced christianity such as tekuder became muslim
islammongols employed many muslims in various fields and increasingly took their advice in administrative affairs
muslims became a favored class of officials as they were well educated and knew turkish and mongolian
notable mongol converts to islam include nogai khan oljeitu tuda mengu negudar and berke who was the first muslim leader of any the mongol khanates
ghazan was the first muslim khan to adopt islam as national religion of ilkhanate followed by uzbek who urged his subjects to accept the religion as well
though in moghulistan mongols continued their nomadic lifestyle as buddhism and shamanism flourished until the 1350 's
while three out of the four mongol khanates converted to islam mongol men did not fully prohibit women 's political influence
though the yuan dynasty was the only khanate not to convert to islam there had been many muslim foreigners since the khans were tolerant of other religions
contact between yuan emperors in china and papal states and other muslim states lasted until the mid-14th century
but chingisid princes maintained contact with muslims in central asia and northwestern china so long during the post imperial period
according to jack weatherford there were more than one million muslims in yuan dynasty
tengerism shamanism)shamans which practics a form of animism with several meaning and with different characters was popular religion in ancient central asia and siberia
the central in the raltionship between humen and nature will be the worship of the blue mighty eternal heaven blue sky 
there are a total of 99 tengris sky spirits or heavenly creatures in the lower and upper world
in which köke möngke tengri eternal blue heaven is the higest
he is the creator of the visible and invisible world
in the asian mythologies it is referred to such as a monotheistic world with multiple gods tengris burkhans and lords
the next to köke möngke tengri is the qurmusata king
there were famous shamans in mongol empire such as teb tengri and khorchi
and most of early great khagans except kublai and khans of golden horde and chagatai khanate such as batu tokhta chagatai duwa and kebek were shamanists
while ghazan converted to islam he still practiced some elements of mongol shamanism
the yassa code remained in place and mongol shamans were allowed to remain in the ilkhanate empire and remained politically influential throughout his reign as well as oljeitu 's
however ancient mongol shamanistic traditions went into decline with the demise of oljeitu and with the rise of rulers practicing a purified form of islam
trade networks mongols prized their commercial and trade relationships with neighboring economies and this policy they continued during the process of their conquests and during the expansion of their empire
all merchants and ambassadors having proper documentation and authorization traveling through their realms were protected
this greatly increased overland trade
during the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries european merchants numbering hundreds perhaps thousands made their way from europe to the distant land of china marco polo is only one of the best known of these
well traveled and relatively well maintained roads linked lands from the mediterranean basin to china
the mongol empire had negligible influence on seaborne trade
mail system letter of oljeitu to philippe le bel 1305
the huge roll measures 302x50 cm
the mongol empire had an ingenious and efficient mail system for the time often referred to by scholars as the yam which had lavishly furnished and well guarded relay posts known as örtöö set up all over the mongol empire
the yam system would be replicated later in the u.s. in the form of the pony express
a messenger would typically travel 25 miles 40 km from one ordu to the next and he would either receive a fresh rested horse or relay the mail to the next rider to ensure the speediest possible delivery
the mongol riders regularly covered 125 miles per day which is faster than the fastest record set by the pony express some 600 years later
military conquests central asia mongol invasion of central asia initially was composed of genghis khan 's victory over and unification of the mongol and turkic central asian confederations such as merkits tartars mongols uighurs that eventually created the mongol empire
it then continued with invasion of khwarezmid empire in persia
middle east the mongol invasion of the middle east consists of the conquest by force or voluntary submission of the areas today known as iran iraq syria and parts of turkey with further mongol raids reaching southwards as far as gaza into the palestine region in 1260 and 1300
the major battles were the battle of baghdad 1258 when the mongols sacked the city which for 500 years had been the centre of islamic power and the battle of ain jalut in 1260 when the muslim egyptian mamluks with some unusual provisioning assistance from the christian european crusaders were for the first time able to stop the mongol advance at ain jalut in the northern part of what is today known as the west bank
due to a combination of political and geographic factors such as lack of sufficient grazing room for their horses the mongol invasion of the middle east turned out to be the farthest that the mongols would ever reach towards the mediterranean and africa
east asia mongol invasion of east asia refers to the mongols 13th and 14th century conquests under genghis khan and his descendants of mongol invasion of china the invasion of korea which forced korea to become a vassal and attempted mongol invasion of japan and it also can include mongols attempted invasion of vietnam
the biggest conquest was the total invasion of china in the end
europemongol invasion of europe largely constitute of their invasion and conquest of kievan rus much of russia invasion of poland and hungary among others
pope ’s envoy to mongol khan giovanni de plano carpini who passed through kiev in february 1246 wrote:"they
the mongols attacked russia where they made great havoc destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men and they laid siege to kiev the capital of russia after they had besieged the city for a long time they took it and put the inhabitants to death
when we were journeying through that land we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground
kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town but now it has been reduced almost to nothing for there are at the present time scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery
after genghis khanögedei khan genghis khan 's son and successor kublai khan genghis khan 's grandson and founder of the yuan dynasty hulagu genghis khan 's grandson and founder of the il khanat first the mongol empire was ruled by ögedei khan genghis khan 's third son and designated heir but after his death in 1241 the fractures which would ultimately crack the empire began to show
enmity between the grandchildren of genghis khan resulted in a five year regency by ögedei 's widow until she finally got her son guyuk khan confirmed as great khan
but he only ruled two years and following his death he was on his way to confront his cousin batu khan who had never accepted his authority another regency followed until finally a period of stability came with the reign of mongke khan from 1251 1259
the last universally accepted great khan was his brother arigboh aka
arigbuga or arigbuha
his elder brother kublai khan dethroned him with his own supporters after some extensive battles
kublai khan ruled from 1260 1294
despite his recognition as great khan he was unable to keep his brother hulagu and their cousin berke from open warfare in 1263 and after kublai 's death there was not an accepted great khan so the mongol empire was fragmented for good
genghis khan divided his realm into four khanates subdivisions of a single empire under the great khan khan of khans
the following khanates emerged after the regency following ögedei khan 's death and became formally independent after kublai khan 's death blue horde under batu khan and white horde under orda khan would soon be combined into the golden horde with batu khan emerging as khan
il khanate hulegu khan empire of the great khan china kublai khan mongol homeland present day mongolia including kharakhorum tolui khan chagatai khanate chagatai khan the mongol empire and its successor khanates the empire 's expansion continued for a generation or more after genghis 's death in 1227
under genghis 's successor ögedei khan the speed of expansion reached its peak
mongol armies pushed into persia finished off the xia and the remnants of the khwarezmids and came into conflict with the song dynasty of china starting a war that concluded in 1279 with the conquest of populous china which then constituted the majority of the world 's economic production
in the late 1230s the mongols under batu khan invaded russia and volga bulgaria reducing most of its principalities to vassalage and pressed on into eastern europe
in 1241 the mongols may have been ready to invade western europe as well having defeated the last polish german and hungarian armies at the battle of legnica and the battle of mohi
batu khan and subutai were preparing to start with a winter campaign against austria and germany and finish with italy
however news of ögedei 's death spared western europe as batu had to turn his attentions to the election of the next great khan
it is often speculated that this was one of the great turning points in history and that europe may well have fallen to the mongols had the invasion gone ahead
during the 1250s genghis 's grandson hulegu khan operating from the mongol base in persia destroyed the abbasid caliphate in baghdad and destroyed the cult of the assassins moving into palestine towards egypt
the great khan möngke having died however he hastened to return for the election and the force that remained in palestine was destroyed by the mamluks under saif ad din qutuz in 1261 at ayn jalut
vassalsthe mongol empire included china most of russia siberia parts of burma and all of georgia armenia cilicia anatolia iraq persia central asia ukraine and belarus
european vassals kingdom of lithuania the nominal vassal
however mongols under orda and burundai successfully invaded southern regions of lithuania in 1241 and in 1259 later nogai the grand duke jogaila officially acknowledged tokhtamysh as overlord in 1382
mongols of golden horde always counted lithuanians as a part of their subjects but there is no evidence of a tributary relationship between them
a number of russian states incl
the republic of novgorod pskov batu khan could not reach northern part of russia due to the marshlands surrounding city states such as novgorod and pskov in 1239
but combined effects of alexander nevsky 's diplomacy mongol threats and teutonic order invasion forced novgorod and later pskov accepted the term of vassalage
according to book mongol tatars in asia europe by mongolian and russian scientists bichigechi berkhchir who was an envoy of kublai khan had worked novgorod for a while
second bulgarian empire during the end of mongol invasion of europe balkan bulgars tried to destroy mongol tumen
but kadan 's raids through bulgaria on his retreat from central europe induced the young kaliman i of bulgaria to pay tribute and accept mongol suzerainty
according to a letter of bela iv to the pope written in 1254 indicates that at that time the bulgarians were still paying tribute to the mongols kingdom of serbia
around 1288 milutin launched an invasion to pacify two bulgarian nobles in today 's north east serbia in the branicevo region but those nobles were vassals of the bulgarian prince of vidin shishman
shishman attacked milutin but was defeated and milutin in return sacked his capital vidin
but shishman was a vassal of nogai khan de facto ruler of the golden horde
nogai khan threatened to punish milutin for his insolence but changed his mind when the serbian king sent him gifts and hostages
among the hostages was his son stefan decanski who managed to escape back to serbia after nogai khan 's death in 1299
southeast asian vassals annamchampakhmer empire sukhotaimiddle east vassals the principality of antioch and tripoli
the small crusader state paid annual tributes for many years
the closest thing to actual frankish cooperation with mongol military actions was the overlord subject relationship between the mongols and the franks of antioch and others
empire of trebizond the seljuks and the military forces of trebizond were defeated by the mongols in 1243
after that kaykhusraw ii the sultan of iconium was compelled to relieve himself by paying tribute and supplying annually horses hunting dogs and jewels
the emperor manuel i of trebizond realizing the impossibility of fighting the mongols made a speedy peace with them and on condition of paying an annual tribute became a mongol vassal
the empire reached its greatest prosperity and had opportunity to export the produce of its own rich hinterland during the era of ilkhans
but with the decline of mongol power in 1335 trebizond suffered increasingly from turkish attacks civil wars and domestic intrigues
tributary states small states of malay goryeo present day korea byzantine empire
in the winter of 1265 nogai led a mongol raid on byzantine thrace with his vassal balkan bulgars
in the spring of 1265 he defeated the armies of michael viii palaeologus
instead of fighting most of the byzantines fled due to powerful mongol army
michael managed to escape with the assistance of italian merchants
after this thrace was plundered by nogai 's army and the byzantine emperor signed a treaty with berke khan of golden horde giving his daughter euphrosyne in marriage to nogai
michael also sent much valuable fabric to the golden horde as a tribute thereafter areas that avoided mongol conquest essentially only five areas accessible to the mongols avoided conquest by them indochina south asia japan western europe and arabia
also two important cities that evaded the mongol conquest were vienna and jerusalem
both evaded the conquest because of the death of a great khan
western europe while the mongolian empire extended into poland and threatening present day austria the mongols were not able to push into western europe
the most popular explanation was the fact that on 11 december 1241 during pre emptive operations by mongol reconnaissance forces inside austria for the invasion of vienna news came that ogedei khan died and bound by mongol tradition all mongol commanders and princes had to report back to the capital of karakorum to elect a new khan
it was believed that the mongol abandonment of the european campaign was only temporary but in fact the mongols had committed no further campaigns into europe in earnest
some western historians attribute european survival to mongol unwillingness to fight in the more densely populated german principalities where the wetter weather affected their bows
but the same weather did not stop them from devastating russia or the campaigns against the southern song and europe was less densely populated than china
the probable answer for the mongol 's stopping after the mohi river and the destruction of the hungarian army was that they never intended to advance further at that time
batu khan had made his russian conquests safe for the next 10 generations and when the great khan died he rushed back to mongolia to put in his claim for power
upon his return relations with his cousin guyuk khan had deteriorated to the point that open warfare between them came shortly after guyuk 's death
the point is that the mongols were unable to bring a unified army to bear on either europe or egypt after 1260
batu khan was in fact planning invasion of europe all the way to the great sea the atlantic ocean when he died in 1255
his son inherited the khanate but also died in a short time and batu 's brother berke became khan of the kipchak khanate
he was far more interested in fighting with his cousin hulagu than invading the remainder of europe which was no threat to him
vietnam and japan another area not conquered by mongols was vietnam under the tr?n dynasty which repelled mongol attacks in 1257/1258 1284/1285 and 1287/1288
but around 1288 annam and champa started to pay tributary to the emperors of the yuan dynasty
that is why the two states of vietnam are considered vassals of the mongol empire
japan also repelled massive mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281
japan 's ruler hojo tokimune first sent back the emissaries time and time again without audience in kamakura and then after the first invasion was so bold as to behead kubilai 's emissaries twice
in both japan and vietnam kublai sent part of the mongol armies instead of concentrating on vietnam first and then japan
furthermore the splitting of resources left the mongols with a fleet that was not readily equipped for the storms that plagued the sea of japan
a great storm sank the primary invasion fleet and killed most of the mongol army during the 1281 invasion
southeast asia many other kingdoms in indochina could counter the mongol invasion such as the maoluang kingdom or kingdom of mong mao in northern thailand shan and kachin in today 's northern and northeastern myanmar as well as assam in eastern india and southwestern china
sa khaan pha or si ke fa king of maoluang kingdom was able to negotiate a treaty after he defeated the mongols three times during the period of kublai khan
he received authority over the land south of the sang city which is now kunming in the yunnan province of china
mongol led yuan forces attacked champa in southern vietnam with large scale of army once in 1287
lanna and sibsongpanna in present northern thailand northern laos and southern china lan xang in present laos the siamese kingdoms of chiang saen or chieng saeng lavo haripunjai phyao and sukhotai never invaded by the mongols due to the rough terrain
however the burmese pagan dynasty was destroyed in 1287 by kublai khan as well as the northern vietnamese empire of viet
sodu sent also 100 mongols to raid on khmer empire while he was fighting with champa
but yuan later made most of southeast asian states tributary vassals somehow except java where they failed
south asia south asia was also able to withstand the advance of the mongols
at this time northern india was under the rule of the delhi sultanate
though the mongols raided into the punjab and besieged delhi itself unsuccessfully the sultans mostly notably ghiyasuddin balban were able to keep them at bay and roll them back
historian john keay credited the successful combination of the indian elephant phalanx and maneuverable central asian cavalry operated by the rulers of northern india
ironically 300 years later babar a timurid scion who claimed descent from genghis khan would go on to conquer northern india and found the mughal empire
arabia and egypt the final area which would withstand the mongols was the levant
the mamluks successfully defended the holy land with the aid of berke khan who allied himself with them after his cousin enraged him by sacking baghdad berke was a muslim and sent word to the great khan that he would call him to account hulagu khan for he has murdered the caliph in baghdad and killed all the faithful
this mongol against mongol fighting after the mamluks defeated the mongols at ain jalut in 1260 ultimately brought down the mongol empire
mamluks also repelled mongol attacks in syria in 1271 1281 1299/1300 1303/1304 and 1312
disintegrationwhen genghis khan died a major potential weakness of the system he had set up manifested itself
it took many months to summon the kurultai as many of its most important members were leading military campaigns thousands of miles from the mongol heartland
and then it took months more for the kurultai to come to the decision that had been almost inevitable from the start that genghis 's choice as successor his third son ögedei should become great khan
ögedei was a rather passive ruler and personally self indulgent but he was intelligent charming and a good decision maker whose authority was respected throughout his reign by apparently stronger willed relatives and generals whom he had inherited from genghis
after the initial massive campaigns at the beginning of the conquest of europe where the mongol war machine handily defeated the hungarian and polish armies the hospitallers the teutonic knights as well as the slaughtering of countless many civilians ögedei khan suddenly died in 1241 just as the mongol forces under general subutai were preparing an all out assault on vienna austria
this sudden vacuum of power is seen as the beginning of the events that led to the decline of the mongol empire
as customary to mongol military tradition all generals and princes and thus the tumens had to report back to the capital karakorum thousands of miles away the relocation of the capital to dadu would add to this difficulty under kublai khan for the election of a successor to the throne
pending a kurultai to elect ögedei 's successor his widow toregene khatun assumed power and proceeded to ensure the election of her son guyuk by the kurultai
batu bitterly disappointed by the postponement of the european campaign was unwilling to accept guyuk as great khan but lacked the influence in the kurultai to procure his own election
therefore while moving no further west he simultaneously insisted that the situation in europe was too precarious for him to come east and that he could not accept the result of any kurultai held in his absence
the resulting stalemate lasted four years
in 1246 batu eventually agreed to send a representative to the kurultai but never acknowledged the resulting election of guyuk as great khan toregene khatun and guyuk were also less in favour of the mandarin officials installed by genghis khan himself most notably chancellor yeh lu ch'u ts'ai who were so instrumental in the successful administration of mongol conquests choosing instead to place muslim administrators from the new domains to help run mongol politics
guyuk died in 1248 only two years after his election on his way west apparently to force batu to acknowledge his authority and his widow oghul ghaymish assumed the regency pending the meeting of the kurultai unfortunately for her she could not keep the power
batu remained in the west but this time gave his support to his and guyuk 's cousin möngke who was duly elected great khan in 1251
möngke khan assigned his brother kublai or qubilai to a province in north china which would unwittingly provide kublai with a chance to become khan in 1260 shortly after möngke 's death in 1259
kublai expanded the mongol empire and became a favorite of möngke
kublai 's conquest of china is estimated by holworth based on census figures to have killed over 18 million people
as pointed out by rummel these figures are probably highly exaggerated although a large number of people died in the course of the conquest
later though when kublai began to adopt many chinese laws and customs his brother was persuaded by his advisors that kublai was becoming too sinicized and would be considered treasonous
möngke kept a closer watch on kublai from then on but died campaigning against southern song china at the fishing town in chongqing
after his older brother 's death kublai placed himself in the running for a new khan against his younger brother and although his younger brother won the election kublai defeated him in battle and kublai became the last great khan
note among historians there is no consensus who was the last true great khan
many scholars believe that möngke was the last because after his death the great empire fell apart into 4 khanates
he proved to be a strong warrior but his critics still accused him of being too closely tied to chinese culture
when he moved his headquarters to beijing there was an uprising in the old capital that he barely staunched
he focused mostly on foreign alliances and opened trade routes
he dined with a large court every day and met with many ambassadors foreign merchants and even offered to convert to christianity if this religion was proved to be correct by 100 priests
by the reign of kublai khan the empire was already in the process of splitting into a number of smaller khanates
after kublai died in 1294 his heirs failed to maintain the pax mongolica effective
inter family rivalry compounded by the complicated politics of succession which twice paralyzed military operations as far off as hungary and the borders of egypt crippling their chances of success and the tendencies of some of the khans to drink themselves to death fairly young causing the aforementioned succession crises hastened the disintegration of the empire
another factor which contributed to the disintegration was the difficulty of the potential two weeks extra transit time of officials and messengers and a general decline of morale when the capital was moved from karakorum to dadu the yuan name for the modern day city of beijing by kublai khan as kublai khan associated more closely to chinese culture
kublai concentrated on the war with the song dynasty assuming the mantle of ruler of china while the khanates to the west gradually drifted away
the four descendant empires were the mongol founded yuan dynasty in china the chagatai khanate the golden horde that controlled central asia and russia and the ilkhanate that ruled persia from 1256 to 1353
the conflict between kublai khan and the khanates in central asia led by kaidu qaidu had lasted for a few decades until the beginning of the 14th century when both of them had died
of the ilkhanate their ruler ilkhan ghazan was converted to islam in 1295 and renounced all allegiance to the great khan
he actively supported the expansion of this religion in his empire
the mongol empire was never again under one rule though the other three khanates negotiated peace with temür khan of yuan dynasty and acknowledged him as their nominal overlord in 1304 in order to maintain trade and diplomatic relations
during 1330 's bishop probably hungarian from soltaniyeh described their relationship in his letter to the pope the king of cathay i.e. china is one of the most powerful kings
he is a lord of all tatars ilkhan abusay ozbek khan and a khan of moghulistan send him precious stones furs and animals to show him their respect every year
but most of the khanates began to fall during the middle of the century
silk road the mongol expansion throughout the asian continent from around 1215 to 1360 helped bring political stability and re establish the silk road vis à vis karakorum
the 13th century saw a franco mongol alliance with exchange of ambassadors and even military collaboration in the holy land
the chinese mongol rabban bar sauma visited the courts of europe in 1287 1288
with rare exceptions such as marco polo or christian missionaries such as william of rubruck few europeans traveled the entire length of the silk road
instead traders moved products much like a bucket brigade with luxury goods being traded from one middleman to another from china to the west and resulting in extravagant prices for the trade goods
the disintegration of the mongol empire led to the collapse of the silk road 's political unity
also falling victim were the cultural and economic aspects of its unity
turkic tribes seized the western end of the silk road from the decaying byzantine empire and sowed the seeds of a turkic culture that would later crystallize into the ottoman empire under the sunni faith
turkic- mongol military bands in iran after some years of chaos were united under the saffavid tribe under whom the modern iranian nation took shape under the shiite faith
meanwhile mongol princes in central asia were content with sunni orthodoxy with decentralized princedoms of the chagatay timurid and uzbek houses
in the kypchak- tatar zone mongol khanates all but crumbled under the assaults of the black death and the rising power of muscovy
in the east end the chinese ming dynasty overthrew the mongol yoke and pursued a policy of economic isolationism
yet another force the kalmyk oyrats pushed out of the baikal area in central siberia but failed to deliver much impact beyond turkestan
some kalmyk tribes did manage to migrate into the volga north caucasus region but their impact was limited
after the mongol empire the great political powers along the silk road became economically and culturally separated
accompanying the crystallization of regional states was the decline of nomad power partly due to the devastation of the black death and partly due to the encroachment of sedentary civilizations equipped with gunpowder
ironically as a footnote the effect of gunpowder and early modernity on europe was the integration of territorial states and increasing mercantilism
whereas along the silk road it was quite the opposite failure to maintain the level of integration of the mongol empire and decline in trade partly due to european maritime trade
the silk road stopped serving as a shipping route for silk around 1400
legacythe mongol empire was the largest contiguous empire in human history
the 13th and 14th century when the empire came to power is often called the age of the mongols
the mongol armies during that time were extremely well organized
the death toll by battle massacre flooding and famine of the mongol wars of conquest is placed at about 40 million according to some sources
many ancient sources described genghis khan 's conquests as wholesale destruction on an unprecedented scale in their certain geographical regions and therefore probably causing great changes in the demographics of asia
for example over much of central asia speakers of iranian languages were replaced by speakers of turkic languages
the eastern part of the islamic world experienced the terrifying holocaust of the mongol invasion which turned northern and eastern iran into a desert
between 1220 and 1260 the total population of persia may have dropped from 2,500,000 to 250,000 as a result of mass extermination and famine
non military achievements of the mongol empire include the introduction of a writing system based on the uyghur script that is still used in inner mongolia
the empire unified all the tribes of mongolia which made possible the emergence of a mongol nation and culture
modern mongolians are generally proud of the empire and the sense of identity that it gave to them
some of the long term consequences of the mongol empire include the yuan dynasty the part of mongol empire in china is traditionally given credit for reuniting china and expanding its frontiers
the use of paper money reached its peak under the mongol emperors in china however later administration 's wrong policy caused hyperinflation
the language chagatai widely spoken among a group of turks is named after a son of genghis khan
it was once widely spoken and had a literature but eventually became extinct in russia
moscow rose to prominence during the mongol tatar yoke some time after russian rulers were accorded the status of tax collectors for mongols which meant that the mongols themselves would rarely visit the lands that they owned
the russian ruler ivan iii overthrew the mongols completely to form the russian tsardom after the great stand on the ugra river proved the mongols vulnerable and led to the independence of the grand duke of moscow
europe ’s knowledge of the known world was immensely expanded by the information brought back by ambassadors and merchants
when columbus sailed in 1492 his missions were to reach cathay the land of the genghis khan
some research studies indicate that the black death which devastated europe in the late 1340s may have reached from china to europe along the trade routes of the mongol empire
in 1347 the genoese possession of caffa a great trade emporium on the crimean peninsula came under siege by an army of mongol warriors under the command of janibeg
after a protracted siege during which the mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon
the corpses were catapulted over the city walls infecting the inhabitants
the genoese traders fled transferring the plague via their ships into the south of europe whence it rapidly spread
the total number of deaths worldwide from the pandemic is estimated at 75 million people there were an estimated 20 million deaths in europe alone
it is estimated that between one quarter and two thirds of the of europe 's population died from the outbreak of the plague between 1348 and 1350
among the western accounts r. j. rummel estimated that 30 million people were killed under the rule of the mongol empire
the population of china fell by half in fifty years of mongol rule
before the mongol invasion chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants after the conquest was completed in 1279 the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people
david nicole states in the mongol warlords terror and mass extermination of anyone opposing them was a well tested mongol tactic
 about half of the russian population died during the invasion
historians estimate that up to half of hungary 's two million population at that time were victims of the mongol invasion
genghis khan founder of the mongol empire and mongol nation
one of the more successful tactics employed by the mongols was to wipe out urban populations that had refused to surrender
in the invasion of kievan rus almost all major cities were destroyed
if they chose to submit the people were spared and treated as slaves which meant most of them would be driven to die quickly by hard work with the exception that war prisoners became part of their army to aid in future conquests
in addition to intimidation tactics the rapid expansion of the empire was facilitated by military hardiness especially during bitterly cold winters military skill meritocracy and discipline
subutai in particular among the mongol commanders viewed winter as the best time for war while less hardy people hid from the elements the mongols were able to use frozen lakes and rivers as highways for their horsemen a strategy he used with great effect in russia
the mongol empire had a lasting impact unifying large regions some of which such as eastern and western russia and the western parts of china remain unified today albeit under different rulership
the mongols themselves were assimilated into local populations after the fall of the empire and many of these descendants adopted local religions for example the eastern khanates largely adopted buddhism and the western khanates adopted islam largely under sufi influence
the last khan who was the ruler of south asia bahadur shah zafar was deposed by the british after the collapse of the 1857 uprising and exiled to rangoon where he lies buried
his sons were killed by the british in humayun 's tomb the burial place of their ancestor in delhi
the influence of the mongol empire may prove to be even more direct zerjal et al
2003 identify a y chromosomal lineage present in about 8 of the men in a large region of asia or about 0.5 of the men in the world
the paper suggests that the pattern of variation within the lineage is consistent with a hypothesis that it originated in mongolia about 1,000 years ago
such a spread would be too rapid to have occurred by diffusion and must therefore be the result of selection
the authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male line descendants of genghis khan and that it has spread through social selection
mongolia today
in addition to the khanates and other descendants the mughal royal family of south asia are also descended from genghis khan
babur 's mother was a descendant whereas his father was directly descended from timur tamerlane
at the time of genghis khan 's death in 1227 the empire was divided among his four sons with his third son as the supreme khan and by the 1350s the khanates were in a state of fracture and had lost the order brought to them by genghis khan
eventually the separate khanates drifted away from each other becoming the il khans dynasty based in iran the chagatai khanate in central asia the yuan dynasty in china and what would become the golden horde in present day russia
