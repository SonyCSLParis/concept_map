christian mongol crusader alliance
first the mongols attacked russia quote:1237 40 mongols invade russia destroying all of its main cities except novgorod and pskov tatars establish the empire of the golden horde in southern russia
bbc)then christians attacked russia a couple of years later quote the battle of the ice was a battle between the republic of novgorod and the livonian branch of the teutonic knights whose army consisted mostly of estonians on april 5 1242 at lake peipus
the battle was a significant defeat sustained by roman catholic crusaders during the northern crusades which were directed against pagans and eastern orthodox christians rather than muslims in the holy land
the crusaders defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the orthodox novgorod republic and other russian territories for the next century
wikipedia)and then mongols attacked iraq with christian assistance cp khan hulagu 's wife was christian some years thereafter quote the siege of baghdad which occurred in 1258 was an invasion siege and sacking of the city of baghdad the capital of the abbasid caliphate at the time and the modern day capital of iraq by the ilkhanate mongol forces along with other allied troops under hulagu khan
the invasion left baghdad in a state of total destruction
baghdad remained depopulated and in ruins for several centuries and the event is widely regarded as the end of the islamic golden age
the mongol army contained a large contingent of various units from christian vassals chief among them apparently the georgians who were eager to avenge the sacking of their capital tiflis decades earlier by jalal al din khwarazmshah
other participating christian forces were the armenian army led by their king and some frankish troops from the principality of antioch wikipedia)note that the ilkhanate initially embraced many religions but was particularly sympathetic to buddhism and christianity wikipedia
question does the above suggest any kind of loose coordination of action between christians and their mongol allies in the mid-13th century ad sure there was some sort of christian mongol alliance at the time

a century later quote the battle of kulikovo was a battle between tatar mamai and muscovy dmitriy and portrayed by russian historiography as a stand off between russians and the golden horde
the battle took place on september 8 1380
tatar mamai reflected economic and political interests from outside particularly western europe which in the battle were represented by numerous genoese mercenaries wikipedia)another centuries later still mongols christian crusaders attacked russia again quote the great standoff on the ugra river was a standoff between the forces of akhmat khan of the great horde and the grand prince ivan iii of russia in 1480
in early 1480 the teutonic order of livonia subjected the western borders of russia to multiple attacks
in january 1480 ivan 's brothers boris volotsky and andrey bolshoy turned against him
akhmat khan decided to take advantage of the political discontent and in june 1480 sent a reconnaissance unit to investigate the right bank of the oka river
in autumn his army started to advance towards moscow he passed through the lithuanian territories of his ally king casimir and stood on the lithuanian muscovite border on the river ugra wikipedia)and then a group of mongols who had become muslims by this point formed an alliance with the christian poles and lithuanians against the teutonic knights
the teutonic knights eventually suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of grumwald in 1410

interesting letter from queen russudan of georgia to the pope
we were preparing for crusade when jebe and subutai invaded
raided georgia killed king georgi iv lasha and then went north
they were carrying nine tailed yak banners and we thought they were christians
+ we knew they invaded khwarezmid empire)it worked the other way around as well i seem to remember the crusaders allowing a lorge muslim army from egypt pass unmolested through their territory to defeat the mongols in iraq
it was a little earlier than that 1260 to be exact
the mulmaks seeked permision to pass unmolested through the crusader kingdoms even stopping to resupply outside of acre
they were able to meet the mongols in battle and effect the first milatry defeat on them at battle_of_ain_jalut
battle_of_ain_jalut
i do n't think they were allies
the crusaders and the mongols simultaneously and independently waged wars against arabs on the middle east and russians on eastern europe which is the corollary from the mongol expansion in asia and the european medieval circumstances
please elaborate on this if you know more dates and which crusade was taking place at the time + combatants
i have been told that if the crusaders had jioned forces with the mongols and attacked the muslim army then there was a good chance that the entire islamic faith would crumble
