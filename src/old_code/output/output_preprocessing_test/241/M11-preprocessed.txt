prester john the franco mongol alliance say what
perhaps it ’d be better if i explain this in reverse order the franco mongol alliance fma prester john
so first the fma
since when did france ever ally with the mongols
well technically they never did
in the 13th and 14th centuries ~7th crusade or so muslims and asians considered all western europeans as franks and the western europeans called those from the ilkhanate in persia as mongols in hindsight the europeans kind of win this one as the ilkhanate was a breakaway state of the great mongol empire and was ruled by the mongol house of hulagu but that ’s like saying australians are british or something
anyways both sides had a common interest in defeating the mamluks and the muslims that ruled the holy lands in between them the mongols were mainly in it for the lands not the holy
as the common saying goes the enemy of my enemy is my friend
at first communication between the two did n’t go so well when they started around 1220 ce
the franks requested that the mongols convert to western christianity while the mongols responded in turn by demanding for tribute and submission i ’m honestly unsure what is more stereotypical
as the mongols continued their domination westward towards the mediterranean they actually started to be perceived as the greater threat in the region by the middle eastern christian kingdoms
it was around 1265 ce however when the franks suddenly had a paradigm shift
what if we get all this oriental negative energy of pillaging and destruction and instead we channel it towards the muslims
yeah
let ’s turn that frown upside down
many gifts delegations and messages later the mongols loosely agree to help the franks squash the muslims and promise to give jerusalem back to the christians once it has been reconquered
but the fma was never really firmly established even after much negotiations through the decades talking to the ilkhanate ’s founder his son and his grandson and his great grandson and his other slightly younger great grandson yep
apparently ally was a very foreign concept in categorizing non empire lands the mongols would label them as enemies conquered or in rebellion
once in a while though a mongol army would indeed be sent to join with a frank army to beseige a city only to arrive a few months before or after because you know communication and transportation was super slow back then
eventually the crusaders lost the holy lands and the ilkhanate dissolved into several warring states
a true fma never succeeded and historians today still debate on how significant such an alliance would ’ve been against the muslims
so then who ’s this prester john guy remember that whole paradigm shift thing the franks had a paragraph ago
well it ’s slightly because of him that they had that whole self reflective experience
prester john
the descendant of one of the magi benevolent ruler of a christian stronghold amongst the lands of the muslims and pagans defender of the gates of alexander guardian of the fountain of youth neighbor of the garden of eden seer of all
yeah
that prester john
first in india then in central asia then in ethiopia his much sought after kingdom migrated thousands of kilometers throughout the centuries as the franks learned of new lands
well it gets deeper than that
after surviving and returning from the horrendous loss that was the 5th crusades in 1221 the bishop of acre began spreading some good news and hope for the dispirited christians
prester john ’s son king david of india who had just conquered muslim persia was setting his sights on pillaging baghdad and restoring jerusalem to its former glory
the holy lands will be won with help from the east
now comes one of those majorly odd coincidences or plot twists embedded in history perhaps on par with conquistador cortés and aztec god quetzalcoatl
for the most part the bishop of acre was right
the khwarazmian empire in persia was invaded and conquered by an army of the east and that army did seek to control more muslim lands farther west
however the bishop of acre did get one thing wrong really wrong
turns out that his legendary savior was not king david of india but in fact ruthless militant horde leader genghis khan
oh boy
but despite genghis khan ’s immense empire destroying power and atrociousness he was no match against prester john
instead of killing the legend poor genghis became part of it
he was continued to be seen as the son of prester john who then simply took on the carnal form of genghis ’s foster father
it did n’t really help genghis that said foster father was indeed a nestorian christian ruler which only affirmed the legend even more
gradually the kingdom of prester john slowly moved from india into central asia as more christian ambassadors explored the well protected roads of the mongol empire
and as it did the stories of the john family became less otherworldly and more soap opera ly family fights arguments over hands in marriage etc
if anything genghis just stripped the more fantastical elements from the original legend making it even more believable
and so to come full circle one of genghis khan ’s many grandsons eventually grows up to become that ally”-ignorant founder of the ilkhanate meaning he was the great grandson of prester john which was a close enough famial relation to give the franks hope to seek out a franco mongol alliance which ended up never happening anyways
the fma http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-mongol_allianceprester john http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prester_johnso what ’s up with prester john in ethiopia
ethiopia has deep christian roots dating back to the 1st century ce and this was known by the europeans even then
however after the rise of islam contact between the two was mostly severed
this most likely gave rise to mystery and exocitism and soon enough ethiopia was strangely described by franks to be one of the three indias like today influential people back then wrote about things they absolutely had no clue about in this case franks writing about the indian ocean
since the legend of prester john started out with him ruling some obscure vague notion of a land called india ethiopia was the perfect setting for him when actual india and central asia did n’t really pan out so well for possible locations after the collapse of the mongol empire
and like with genghis khan and his foster father the mythos again morphed and assumed new characters to survive the test of time
this ethiopian arc of the legend became so strong and widely accepted that when emperor zara yaqob attended the council of florence in 1441 the europeans kept calling him prester john utterly confusing the ethiopian delegation as nowhere in the designated list of official regnal names for the emperor was there a prester john
mind you this was more than 100 years after the dissolution of the ilkhanate and 200 years after the death of the previous prester john genghis khan ’s foster father
but legends keep on living
