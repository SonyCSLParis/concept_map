arghunarghun khan aka argon mongolian cyrillic c. 1258 march 7 1291 was the fourth ruler of the mongol empire 's ilkhanate from 1284 to 1291
he was the son of abaqa khan and like his father was a devout buddhist although pro christian
he was known for sending several embassies to europe in an unsuccessful attempt to form a franco mongol alliance against the muslims in the holy land
it was also arghun who requested a new bride from his great uncle kublai khan
the mission to escort the young kökötchin across asia to arghun was reportedly taken by marco polo
arghun died before kökötchin arrived so she instead married arghun 's son ghazan
biographyarghun was born to abaqa khan and his christian princess wife haimash khatun
arghun himself had multiple wives and his mother in law bulughan khatun raised arghun 's two sons ghazan whose birth mother was qutlugh and öljeitü whose birth mother was uruk khatun both of whom later succeeded him and eventually converted to islam
arghun had öljeitü baptized as a christian at birth and gave him the name nicholas after pope nicholas iv
according to the dominican missionary ricoldo of montecroce he was a man given to the worst of villainy but for all that a friend of the christians
one of the sisters of arghun oljalh was married to the georgian prince wakhtang iii
arghun was a buddhist but as did most turco mongols he showed great tolerance for all faiths even allowing muslims to be judged under koranic law
his minister of finance sa'ad ad dawla was a jew
sa'ad was effective in restoring order to the ilkhanate 's government in part by aggressively denouncing the abuses of the mongol military leaders
conflictsarghun 's reign was relatively peaceful and there were few conflicts with his fellow mongols
he did fight a brief campaign against the chagatai khanate in khorasan
in 1289 1290 he had to deal with an upheaval of the oirat emir nauruz who had to flee to transoxonia
in 1288 and 1290 he repelled invasion forces of the golden horde under tulabuga in the area of the caucasus twice
during arghun 's reign the egyptian mamluks continuously reinforced their power in syria and the mamluk sultan qalawun re captured crusader territories some of which such as tripoli had been vassal states of the turco mongols
the mamluks captured the northern fortress of margat in 1285 lattakia in 1287 and completed the fall of tripoli in 1289
relations with christian powers arghun was one of a long line of genghis khanite rulers who endeavoured to established a franco mongol alliance with the europeans against their common enemies the egyptian mamluks
arghun even promised that if jerusalem were conquered he would have himself baptised
but by the late 13th century western europe was no longer as interested in the waning crusades and arghun 's missions were ultimately fruitless
first mission to the pope in 1285 arghun sent an embassy and a letter to pope honorius iv a latin translation of which is preserved in the vatican
arghun 's letter mentioned the links that arghun 's family had to christianity and proposed a combined military conquest of muslim lands:"as the land of the muslims that is syria and egypt is placed between us and you we will encircle and strangle estrengebimus it
we will send our messengers to ask you to send an army to egypt so that us on one side and you on the other we can with good warriors take it over
let us know through secure messengers when you would like this to happen
we will chase the saracens with the help of the lord the pope and the great khan
 extract from the 1285 letter from arghun to honorius iv vatican second mission to kings philip and edward apparently left without an answer arghun sent another embassy to european rulers in 1287 headed by the ongut turk nestorian monk from china rabban bar sauma with the objective of contracting a military alliance to fight the muslims in the middle east and take the city of jerusalem
the responses were positive but vague
sauma returned in 1288 with positive letters from pope nicholas iv edward i of england and philip iv the fair of france
third mission in 1289 arghun sent a third mission to europe in the person of buscarel of gisolfe a genoese who had settled in persia
the objective of the mission was to determine at what date concerted christian and mongol efforts could start
arghun committed to march his troops as soon as the crusaders had disembarked at saint jean d'acre
buscarel was in rome between july 15 and september 30 1289 and in paris in november december 1289
he remitted a letter from arghun to philippe le bel answering to philippe 's own letter and promises offering the city of jerusalem as a potential prize and attempting to fix the date of the offensive from the winter of 1290 to spring of 1291:"under the power of the eternal sky the message of the great king arghun to the king of france
said i have accepted the word that you forwarded by the messengers under saymer sagura bar sauma saying that if the warriors of il khaan invade egypt you would support them
we would also lend our support by going there at the end of the tiger year 's winter worshiping the sky and settle in damascus in the early spring
if you send your warriors as promised and conquer egypt worshiping the sky then i shall give you jerusalem
if any of our warriors arrive later than arranged all will be futile and no one will benefit
if you care to please give me your impressions and i would also be very willing to accept any samples of french opulence that you care to burden your messengers with
i send this to you by myckeril and say all will be known by the power of the sky and the greatness of kings
this letter was scribed on the sixth of the early summer in the year of the ox at ho'ndlon
 letter from arghun to philippe le bel 1289 france royal archives buscarello was also bearing a memorandum explaining that the mongol ruler would prepare all necessary supplies for the crusaders as well as 30,000 horses
buscarel then went to england to bring arghun 's message to king edward i.
he arrived in london january 5 1290
edward whose answer has been preserved answered enthusiastically to the project but remained evasive about its actual implementation for which he deferred to the pope
assembly of a raiding naval force in 1290 arghun launched a shipbuilding program in baghdad with the intent of having war galleys which would harass the mamluk commerce in the red sea
the genoese sent a contingent of 800 carpenters and sailors to help with the shipbuilding
a force of arbaletiers was also sent but the enterprise apparently foundered when the genoese government ultimately disowned the project and an internal fight erupted at the persian gulf port of basra among the genoese between the guelfe and the gibelin families
fourth mission arghun sent a fourth mission to european courts in 1290 led by andrew zagan or chagan who was accompanied by buscarel of gisolfe and a christian named sahadin
in 1291 pope nicolas iv proclaimed a new crusade and negotiated agreements with arghun hetoum ii of armenia the jacobites the ethiopians and the georgians
on january 5 1291 nicolas addressed a vibrant prayer to all the christians to save the holy land and predicators started to rally christians to follow edward i in a crusade
however the efforts were too little and too late
on may 18 1291 saint jean d'acre was conquered by the mamluks in the siege of acre
in august 1291 pope nicolas wrote a letter to arghun informing him of the plans of edward i to go on a crusade to recapture the holy land stating that the crusade could only be successful with the help of the powerful arm of the mongols
nicolas repeated an oft told theme of the crusader communications to the mongols asking arghun to receive baptism and to march against the mamluks
however arghun himself had died on march 10 1291 and pope nicholas iv would die in march 1292 putting an end to their attempts at combined action
edward i sent an ambassador to arghun 's successor gaikhatu in 1292 in the person of geoffrey de langley but extensive contacts would only resume under arghun 's son ghazan
according to the 20th century historian runciman had the mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the west the existence of outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged
the mameluks would have been crippled if not destroyed and the ilkhanate of persia would have survived as a power friendly to the christians and the west"deatharghun died on march 7 1291 and was succeeded by his brother gaykhatu
the 13th century saw such a vogue of mongol things in the west that many new born children in italy were named after genghis khanite rulers including arghun names such as can grande great khan alaone hulagu argone arghun or cassano ghazan are recorded with a high frequency
