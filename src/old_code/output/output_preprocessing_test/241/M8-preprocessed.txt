the mongol invasion and the destruction of baghdad the 1200s started out looking good for the islamic world
the crusaders had been defeated and jerusalem liberated in 1187 the ismaili fatimids had finally been removed from harassing the muslim world in the mid-1100s and a powerful khwarazmian empire had emerged in persia
however all that would soon turn around when the ruthless mongols would make their way into southwest asia
the destruction and devastation they left in their path has scarcely been seen anywhere else in history
who are the mongols
the mongols were a tribe of nomads from central north asia
they lived on the steppe of that region relying on a nomadic lifestyle of constant movement as a way of life
they were forever dependent on and attached to their horses which was their main mode of transportation
religiously they were polytheistic animists
they never established a large organized empire and instead stayed as a loose coalition of tribes north of china
throughout history they were usually at war with their neighbors
china to the south in fact built the great wall of china during the reign of emperor shi huang 247 221 bc as a means to keep the mongols and others away from their villages
the mongols also feuded with other tribal groups in central asia such as turkic tribes and the tatars
genghis khan mongolian and world history changed forever during the rule of genghis khan
he was a tribal chief for the mongols from 1206 1227
during his reign he managed to unite the many mongol tribes along with numerous turkic tribes as well
with a large unified group he set about conquering any and all land the mongol horsemen could reach
he conquered most of northern china in the 1210s
in doing so he destroyed the xia and jin dynasties as well as conquered beijing
he also managed to conquer most of the turkic tribes of central asia leading all the way into persia
this led him to send armies into eastern europe as well attacking russian lands and even the borders of central europe ’s german states
by the 1220s genghis khan ’s armies had ravaged much of asia and even europe
dark history of terror as a weapon of war more important than what genghis khan conquered was how he conquered
he deliberately used terror as a weapon of war
if a city he was besieging gave up without a fight its people would usually be spared but would have to go under mongol control
if the city fought against the mongols everyone including civilians would be massacred
this reign of terror is a large part of why he was such a successful conqueror
people were more willing to give up than to suffer massacres at his hand
for example when he besieged the city of herat in present day afghanistan he killed over 1,600,000 people
the invasion of the muslim world besides some raids and massacres on the borderlands of islam genghis khan did not invade far into the muslim world
under his successor ogedei the muslim world continued to be spared mongol wrath
in 1248 however genghis khan ’s grandson möngke became great khan of the mongols and resolved to extend his sway to the middle east and beyond that if possible to syria and egypt
ten years later mesopotamia was overrun by a mongol horde under his brother hulagu
hulagu was born to tolui one of genghis khan 's sons and sorghaghtani beki
hulagu 's mother successfully navigated mongol politics arranging for all of her sons to become mongol leaders
she was a christian of the church of the east often referred to as nestorianism and hulagu was friendly to christianity
hulagu 's favorite wife doquz khatun was also a christian as was his closest friend and general kitbuqa
it is recorded however that he converted to buddhist as he neared death against the will of his wife dokuz khatun
due to his close affinity to christianity he was supported by crusaders in his military endeavors
the campaign ’s goal appears to be a complete destruction of islam
hulagu himself even had a very deep hatred for everything attached to islam
much of this came from his buddhist and christian advisors who influenced his policies
baghdad before and during 12th century baghdad had been established in 762 by the abbasid caliph al mansur
throughout its history it had been the capital of the muslims as well as the world in general
the libraries of baghdad were unrivaled
the house of wisdom established soon after the city was built was a magnet for the most intelligent scientists thinkers mathematicians and linguists of the world
the caliphs were patrons of literature science and the arts
although by the mid-1200s much of the glamour and importance of baghdad was gone
the caliphs were figureheads more interested in worldly pleasures than serving god through serving the people
the abbasid army was effectively non existent and only served as bodyguards of the caliph
and the scientific achievements of the muslim world were now centered in places such as cairo muslim spain and india
power a cause of divide al-'alqami a shiite was a minister in the court of the caliph al musta'sim
like chalabi al-'alqami had desires of leadership of the land and like chalabi he was not above soliciting the assistance of foreign powers to help even if that assistance would come at great cost to his people or his nation
america was not a superpower in al alqami 's time so he turned his attentions to the mongols
al-'alqami wrote a number of letters to the leader of the mongols hulagu khan inviting him to invade the land promising his support and offering intelligence on the caliph 's armies their strengths and weaknesses and the overall lay of the land
it would he assured the mongols be a cakewalk and within a short space of time the mongol empire could be extended into the previously impervious core of the muslim caliphate
at the same time al-'alqami used his position to influence the caliph to reduce the size of the army thus ensuring that the mongol invasion would be guaranteed little resistance
he also lied to the caliph about the severity of the invasion assuring al musta'sim that if the capital of the caliphate was endangered by a mongol army the islamic world would rush to its aid
the caliph had also been deluded by promises from his greedy wicked vizier al alqami that the mongols could be driven off literally by the women of the city throwing stones at them
on the other hand hulagu accepted al-'alqami 's generous invitation to attack pillage and massacre
the muslim world at this time was in no position to resist the mongol attacks
the abbasid caliphate was nothing but a shell of its former self having no power outside of baghdad
most of persia was disunited as the khwarazmian empire had mostly deteriorated by then
the ayyubid state established by salah al din was only in control of small parts of iraq and syria
in egypt a recent revolution had overthrown salah al din ’s descendants and brought to power the new mamluk sultanate
with his giant army of hundreds of thousands hulagu did not encounter much resistance
the force to eliminate islam was supplemented by a de facto alliance between mongols and christian forces including the king of armenia and his army a frankish contingent from the principality of antioch and a georgian force seeking revenge on the muslim abbasids for the sacking of their capital tiflis decades earlier by the khwarazm shahs
about 1,000 chinese artillery experts also accompanied the army
the crusaders and the armenians also attacked in northern syria diverting some of the turkish contingents that might have been available for the defense of baghdad
as per mongol custom he first issued a written threat to the caliph when i lead my army against baghdad in anger whether you hide in heaven or in earth i will bring you down from the spinning spheres i will toss you in the air like a lion
i will leave no one alive in your realm i will burn your city your land your self
if you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence
if you do not you will see what god has willed
 the mongol army besieging baghdad
the caliph refused the mongol offer to surrender and decided to defend his city against their onslaught
it was at this historic and landmark city that the mongols arrived in 1258
scholars debate the exact size of hulagu ’s force but it was enormous by the standards of the time
the ordu army in turkic from which comes the english horde comprised approximately 300,000 warriors all master horsemen and archers
their training discipline reconnaissance mobility and communications far surpassed those of any contemporary force
organized in units based on factors of 10 they could cover 100 miles in a day
including women children and other noncombatants the entire host numbered by conservative estimates about two million
this massive army stood before the city that was just a shadow of the great capital of the muslim world of the 800s
the siege began in mid january and only lasted two weeks
on january 29 the mongol army began its siege of baghdad constructing a palisade and a ditch around the city
employing siege engines and catapults the mongols attempted to breach the city 's walls and by february 5 had seized a significant portion of the defenses
five days later on february 10 the city surrendered
while the muslim armies put up a good fight the reduced size of the army due to the machinations of al-'alqami meant that they were no match militarily for the mongols
the attacking mongols broke dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliph 's army trapping them
much of the army was slaughtered or drowned
on february 10th 1258 the mongols entered the city of the caliphs
a full week of pillage and destruction commenced
no description can do justice to the horrors that followed
the mongols showed no discretion destroying mosques hospitals libraries and palaces
the grand library of baghdad containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy was destroyed
survivors said that the waters of the tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed
the world will never truly know the extent of what knowledge was lost forever when those books were thrown into the river or burned
the dams on the tigris and the euphrates that the abbasids had built up over a period of five centuries were demolished
the destruction of dams throughout central asia depressed agriculture and slowed population and economic recovery for many centuries
more important than the books however was the loss of life
citizens attempted to flee but were intercepted by mongol soldiers who killed in abundance sparing neither women nor children
martin sicker writes that close to 90,000 people may have died sicker 2000 p. 111
other estimates go much higher
wassaf claims the loss of life was several hundred thousand
ian frazier of the new yorker says estimates of the death toll have ranged from 200,000 to a million
the muslim women who used to hide behind the veils of the great harem were dragged through the streets and alleys each of them becoming a plaything
baghdad was left completely depopulated and uninhabitable
ibn kathir one of the scholars of islamic history noted in his magnum opus bidaaya wa nihaya that the mongols killed so many people that blood would be running down the street like rainwater
after massacring entire towns and villages they assembled huge pyramids of human skulls as a reminder and warning that the mongols were passing through
it would take centuries for baghdad to regain any sort of prominence as an important city
the siege is considered to mark the end of the islamic golden age during which the caliphates had extended their rule from the iberian peninsula to sindh and which was also marked by many cultural achievements
destruction killings and the aftermath after taking baghdad the decision had to be made as to what would be done with the caliph
it is narrated that upon finding the caliph 's great stores of treasure which could have been spent on the defense of his realm hulagu khan locked him in his treasure room without food or water telling him eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt since thou art so fond of it
 the mongols had a superstition which prevented them from spilling the blood of kings onto the earth
al-'alqami had no such qualms and suggested that rather than kill his leader with a sword they should roll him and his family in carpet and then kick them to death
al- alqami volunteered for the task and proceeded to kick his former employer till he died
the mongol coalition of the willing became strained at this brazen rejection of mongol international law
the death of the caliph ushered in a new era of mongol imposed brutality on the majority sunni population back then the shi'a were still a minority in iraq
however for all their cruelty viciousness and relatively barbaric rules of engagement the mongols were pragmatic
they realized that men like al-'alqami that would sell their people and nation to a foreign invader could n't be trusted
if a man holds no loyalty to his own people then how can he be trusted to hold loyalty to an invader and occupier al-'alqami had hoped to be the mongol 's vicegerent in the region but instead he became their slave
any effort to dilute or subvert the practice of islam in the lands under occupation was seen by the mongols as a pre requisite to maintaining the occupation
they therefore imposed a law over their subjects which like present day reformists of islam was essentially non islamic but couched into vague references and pseudo islamic terminology
the mongols called their law al yasiq
in their controlled lands they also started to weaken affiliation of muslims to arabic language
under hulagu 's dynasty iranian historians began writing in persian rather than arabic
the fall of syria after baghdad the mongols continued on westward
hulagu established himself in hamadan from where he organized more expeditions
all of iraq was subjugated
in 1260 mongol forces combined with those of their christian vassals in the region including the army of cilician armenia under hetoum i and the franks of bohemond vi of antioch
this force conquered muslim syria a domain of the ayyubid dynasty
they took the city of aleppo and under the christian general kitbuqa took damascus on march 1 1260
a christian mass was celebrated in the grand mosque of the umayyads and numerous mosques were profaned
the invasion effectively destroyed the ayyubid dynasty theretofore powerful ruler of large parts of the levant egypt and arabia
the last ayyubid king an nasir yusuf was killed by hulagu in 1260
with the islamic power center of baghdad gone and damascus weakened the center of islamic power transferred to the egyptian mamluks in cairo
the reformer and mujaddid ibn taymiyah it is against this backdrop of occupation and foreign laws imposed on the population that one of the most influential and important figures in islamic history would emerge
his name was ibn taymeeyah the sheikh ul islam the scholar of islam as he has been affectionately known throughout the ages
when faced with the imposition of the mongol 's foreign systems of government and laws on the muslim population he rallied against the mongols and those who had supported them declaring that whoever implemented such laws was a disbeliever in islam whoever does this is an infidel who must be fought until he returns to the rule of allah and his messenger
so no one other than he should rule neither minorly or majorly
 this was the first time that a foreign system of belief had been forced on the heartland of the muslim world and ibn taymiyah 's lengthy fatwa provides the theological underpinning for muslim resistance to man made laws in every country in the muslim world
he concluded by stating that defending the muslim lands and expelling the occupying army is the second most important obligation of a muslim after believing in allah
encounter with mamluks hulagu intended to continue south through palestine towards cairo to engage the mamluks
meanwhile in 1252 berke khan converted to islam and in 1257 he assumed power in the golden horde after the death of ulaghchi
like his brother batu he was loyal to the great khan mongke during this time
although aware of berke 's conversion to islam hulagu after conquering persia did n't stop himself from destroying baghdad in 1258 and committing such atrocities
regardless of berke 's affiliation with islam hulagu added iraq to the mongol empire in the cruelest of manners and advanced towards syria and mamluk sultanate to begin a war of attrition against the mamluk sultanate
berke became enraged with hulagu 's rampage through muslim lands and as a preparatory step directed his nephew nogai khan to collect finances for a war with hulagu
berke then struck an alliance with the mamluk sultan qutuz and later sultan baibars of egypt
the mongols for their part attempted to form a franco mongol alliance with or at least demand the submission of the remnant of the crusader kingdom of jerusalem now centered on acre but pope alexander iv had forbidden this
tensions between franks and mongols had also increased when julian of sidon caused an incident resulting in the death of one of kitbuqa 's grandsons
angered kitbuqa had sacked sidon
the barons of acre contacted by the mongols had also been approached by the mamluks seeking military assistance against the mongols
although the mamluks were traditional enemies of the franks the barons of acre recognized the mongols as the more immediate menace
instead of taking sides the crusaders opted for a position of cautious neutrality between the two forces
in an unusual move however they agreed that the egyptian mamluks could march north through the crusader territories unmolested and even camp to resupply near acre
the defeat of mongols the turning point for the mongol occupation came in september 1260 when they had moved into palestine and encountered the mamluks a muslim nation based in egypt
hulagu sent a threatening letter to mamluk sultan qutuz in cairo
he demanded that qutuz open cairo or it would be destroyed like baghdad
that same year mongke died in a military campaign in china
this situation resulted in recalling hulagu back to mangolia as an heir and potential great khan to mongolia in order to elect a new khan
rashid al din quotes berke khan as sending the following message to mongke khan protesting the attack on baghdad not knowing mongke had already died in china
he hulagu has sacked all the cities of the muslims and has brought about the death of the caliph
with the help of god i will call him to account for so much innocent blood
 history proved his words correct in not more than a few years time
while leaving hulagu left behind only two tumens 20,000 men under the leadership of his favorite general naiman kitbuqa noyan a nestorian christian
upon receiving news of hulagu 's departure qutuz quickly assembled a large army at cairo and invaded palestine
qutuz allied with a fellow mamluk baibars who wanted to defend islam after the mongols capture of damascus sacking of baghdad and subjugation of bilad al sham
when news arrived that the mongols had crossed the jordan river sultan qutuz and his forces mainly egyptians proceeded southeast toward the spring of goliath at ayn jalut in the jezreel valley
they met the mongol army in the battle of ayn jalut and fought relentlessly for many hours
mamluk leader baibars mostly implemented hit and run tactics in an attempt to lure the mongol forces into chasing him
baibars and qutuz had hidden the bulk of their forces in the hills to wait in ambush for the mongols to come into range
the mongol leader kitbuqa already provoked by the constant fleeing of baibars and his troops decided to march forwards with all his troops on the trail of the fleeing egyptians
when the mongols reached the highlands egyptians appeared from hiding and the mongols found themselves surrounded by enemy forces as the hidden troops hit them from the sides and qutuz attacked the mongol rear
estimates of the size of the egyptian army range from 24,000 to 120,000
the mongols broke free of the trap and even mounted a temporarily successful counterattack but their numbers had been depleted to the point that the outcome was inevitable
when the battle finally ended the egyptian army had accomplished what had never been done before defeating a mongol army in close combat
almost the whole mongol army that had remained in the region including kitbuqa were either killed or captured that day
the battle of ayn jalut established a low water mark for the mongol conquest
the mongol invasion east and south came to a stop after ayn jalut
this defeat sent shockwaves throughout the mongol empire
it was a turning point for the muslims and broke the spell of mongol invincibility
after the captured leader of the mongol armies was brought to quduz he told him:"despicable man you have shed so much blood wrongfully ended the lives of champions and dignitaries with false assurances and overthrown ancient dynasties with broken promises
now you have finally fallen into a snare yourself
 this prevented a mongol invasion of the holy lands of makkah madinah and jerusalem
this also ensured the safety of the only remaining powerful muslim empire of the time the mamluks
further decline of mongols after the issue of succession was settled and hulagu 's brother kublai khan was established as great khan hulagu returned to his lands by 1262
hulagu sent multiple communications to europe in an attempt to establish a franco mongol alliance against the muslims
on april 10 1262 hulagu sent a letter through john the hungarian to the french king louis ix offering an alliance
it is unclear whether the letter ever reached louis ix in paris the only manuscript known to have survived was in vienna austria
the letter stated hulagu 's intention to capture jerusalem for the benefit of the pope and asked for louis to send a fleet against egypt:"from the head of the mongol army anxious to devastate the perfidious nation of the saracens with the good will support of the christian faith so that you who are the rulers of the coasts on the other side of the sea endeavor to deny a refuge for the infidels your enemies and ours by having your subjects diligently patrol the seas
 letter from hulagu to saint louis
when he massed his armies to attack the mamluks and avenge the defeat at ain jalut he was instead drawn into civil war berke ghengis khan 's grandson and muslim convert from the rank of mongols who promised in his letter to mongke about the revenge for innocent blood shed in baghdad
berke khan allied himself with the mamluks
he initiated a series of raids on hulagu 's territories led by nogai khan
hulagu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the caucasus in 1263
this was the first open war between mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire
berke also dispatched negudar to eastern afghanistan and ghazni recovering lands under il khanate control
berke was responsible for the first official establishment of islam in a khanate of the mongol empire
lessons only the ganges plains of india escaped the mongol conquests thanks to the resistance of the mamluke sultans of india and the statesmanship of altumish and his daughter razia sultana
despite ultimately being unsuccessful in their attempt to destroy islam the mongols left a deep political economic and military scar in the heart of the muslim world
entire regions were depopulated
irrigation canals fields of crops and economic infrastructure were destroyed beyond repair
the political institutions such as the caliphate that held the muslim world together for centuries were simply abolished
the empire established by hulagu stretched over most of muslim southwest asia
the mongol il khanate established by hulagu ’s descendants would rule over persia iraq and anatolia for over 100 years
over decades and centuries the mongols in southwest asia slowly converted to islam and became absorbed in a persian turkish culture
but there is no denying the immense negative effect the mongols had on the muslim world in the 1200s
the death and destruction of the 1200s has not yet been seen again in the muslim world
the muslim world was largely unable to repel the mongol invasion due to disunity and weak political and military institutions
throughout islamic history disunity has always led to invasion and defeat while unity has led to great islamic empires that benefited the entire world
