the cottingley fairies the best hoaxes are the ones that have unforeseen results and this one is no exception
this hoax began in 1917 as just some fun for two girls and ended up being an international hoax that lasted for 65 years
in 1917 two girls ten year old frances griffiths and her cousin sixteen year old elsie wright had just moved from south africa to england specifically to the village of cottingley
the two of them often played outside by a stream called cottingley beck much to the annoyance of their parents since they were always coming in wet and dirty
they claimed they enjoyed playing by the stream because that 's where the fairies and gnomes were
naturally the parents thought of this as nonsense
elsie 's father was a photographer with a darkroom inside his house so to prove what the had claimed to see elsie and frances took a camera near the stream
they brought the camera back and when elsie 's father developed the photograph it showed frances by a bush with a couple fairies dancing on it
her father immediately dismissed it as a fake
a couple months later the girls brought the camera back with a picture of elsie holding out her hand to a foot high gnome
her father was so annoyed that he refused to let them borrow the camera anymore
on the other hand elsie 's mother saw the photos and thought they were authentic
in 1919 elsie 's mother attended a meeting of the theosophical society that discussed fairies
after the meeting was over she showed the photos to the speaker who was so impressed with them that the photos made their way to the large conference of the theosophical society which was held a few months later
it was there that the photos gained the attention of a head member of the society edward gardner
he thought the photos were important for the future of the society and for the future life of humanity in general
he took the photos to a photography expert who authenticated the photos as being real and unfaked
it was around this time that sir arthur conan doyle most known for being the author of the sherlock holmes stories became aware of the photos
doyle was an avid spiritualist and he desired to view the photos to see if he could figure out if they were fake or not
gardner invited doyle to view the photos which doyle ended up feeling had to be authentic
once the photos had doyle 's approval then they must be real in the minds of those involved
doyle and gardner went on to find other expert opinions such as to have the kodak company look at the photos
kodak agreed that the photos were n't faked but the company also said that they could n't be real photos of fairies and that photographic interpretation should n't be the only way of authentication
doyle showed the photos to a physicist friend who said they had to be faked
in 1920 gardner went to meet the family and try to get more photos
he found the family respectable even though elsie 's father still believed the photos to be fake although he could n't prove it
gardner brought his own equiptment
frances and elsie took three more photos each one having fairies
doyle wrote a few articles over the next year publishing the photos from the girls but changing their names to alice and iris
the public 's reaction was mixed with some believing the photos to be real and others believing they were fake
in 1921 gardner went to visit the family one more time
this time he brought equiptment and a clairvoyant named geoffrey hodson
the girls were n't able to create any more photos of fairies but hodson claimed to see fairies everywhere
gardner published the event
frances and elsie were tired of the whole thing by that time
public interest also soon faded however they were never quite gone from the public consciousness
in 1966 elsie was interviewed and she said that they were photographs of her imagination but she did n't say whether the photos were real or not
in the early 1980 's a scientific study was done on the validity of the photos
the results came back that they had to be fakes
the largest criticism of the photos was that the fairies looked like fairies from nursery rhyme books
that criticism was still around in the 1980 's when the study was performed
in an article published in 1983 frances and elsie finally admitted that the photos were fake and they could n't understand why anyone would have believed such a silly story although once doyle announced they had to be real then they felt they could n't tell the truth
frances died in 1986 and elsie died in 1988
they both claimed to have seen fairies but admitted that the photos were faked using copies from a book called princess mary 's gift book
the two cousins quickly grew to hate the fairies when they were children mostly because of the media circus that they created
they fairy pictures still exist and sell for high dollar amounts
bet you did n't know that
