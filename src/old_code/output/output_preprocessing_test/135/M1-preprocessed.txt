cottingley fairies for the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children
truth magazine on the cottingley fairies 5th janurary 1921 the cottingley fairies was a hoax which demonstrates that being a famous novelist does n't prevent you from being credulous
in short elsie wright a wacky art college student persuaded her ten year old cousin frances griffiths to pose with some cardboard cut out fairies for a photo in 1917
later photographs were taken using a double exposure technique to super impose fairy like creatures onto photographs
five photographs were taken in total
reactionword got out and arthur conan doyle who also believed in spiritualism,[1 declared them genuine
he even wrote a book the coming of fairies which explained the photographs in detail what the fairies are doing their rank in fairy society
many other spiritualists and paranormal lovers of the day were also happy to indulge the girls and themselves that the photos were real even the obviously faked ones
edit]the hoax revealed doubts about the reality of the photographs were raised almost immediately although many were still suckered in
the fate of the hoax seemed sealed when a book was discovered that featured line drawings of dancing girls with remarkable similarity to the fairies in the photos but this still did n't dissuade the true believers
over the years the little fib and simple childish prank grew and grew until it was too embarrassing to admit the truth in a manner reminiscent of the fox sisters saga
ever since the photos have been held up as incontrovertible proof that there really are fairies at the bottom of the garden despite the cousins admission in 1981 that they were faked

edit]footnotesâ†‘ it should be noted that conan doyle 's obsession with christian spiritualism was the result of losing his son during the first world war along with several close relatives shortly after
doyle also believed that stage illusionist harry houdini had supernatural powers despite houdini 's open insistence that he did n't
at one point doyle and his wife claimed to have received messages from houdini 's deceased mother
although houdini humored them for the sake of their friendship he privately stated that he could n't accept their claim as his mother had never mastered the english language in life
the creator of sherlock holmes seems to have been so credulous as to defy imagination though this credulity was probably in proportion to the personal loss he suffered in his advancing years
his desire to prove the existence of the invisible world eventually led him to the cottingley fairies providing some degree of relief from the grief he was still experiencing
