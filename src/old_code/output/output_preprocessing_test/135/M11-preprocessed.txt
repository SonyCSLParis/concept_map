1917 july the cottingley fairies the legend in july 1917 16 year old elsie wright and her 10 year old cousin frances griffiths were tired of being chided by elsie 's father over their claims of seeing fairies
so they took a photograph of some to prove their existence
the girls lived together in cottingley on the outskirts of bradford west yorkshire england
they often played together in the small wooded creek behind elsie 's home and this is where they saw the fairies
on a day in july elsie tired of her father 's dismissive attitude to her and frances claims borrowed her father 's camera to take a picture
when the film was developed later in her father 's dark room elsie 's parents were in for a surprise the picture that she had taken was of frances with a troop of fairies dancing in front of her
elsie 's parents were flabbergasted but her father was n't convinced
so a month later frances took a picture of elsie which clearly showed her playing with a gnome
mr. wright still was n't convinced and there the matter settled
the girls showed the pictures to their friends but no particular interest was ever raised by them at least not until two years had passed
elsie 's mother had developed an interest in things supernatural and took the pictures to share with a theosophist meeting in bradford one evening
in no time at all the pictures were the center of attention and argument
of the people who believed the fairies were real the most prominent and vocal was sir arthur conan doyle creator of sherlock holmes
sir arthur printed the first two pictures in strand magazine in 1920 to help support his argument for the existence of fairies this article made the story a worldwide sensation
in 1920 sir arthur arranged for elsie and frances to once again be given a camera and left on their own in the small creek
the results were three more photos of the fairies the last to be made for shortly after elsie and frances moved away from one another and stopped seeing fairies
sir arthur later printed these three pictures in a sequel to his earlier article and in 1922 he expanded the two articles into a book the coming of the fairies
