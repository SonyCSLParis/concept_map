the mystery of the cottingley fairies09:30 arthur conan doyle elsie wright fairies frances griffiths history
it is hard to believe that the man who gave the world the smartest most rational detective of all times could be taken in by an hoax
but that 's exactly what happened to sir arthur conan doyle and more than once too
his belief in the supernatural was so strong that he allowed his wishes and emotions to overrule his head
like in the case of the cottingley fairies the most famous and remarkable hoax doyle and half the world fell for
in the middle of 1917 nine year old frances griffiths and her mother left south africa for the uk
once arrived they moved in with frances aunt polly wright her husband and their 16th year old daughter elsie
the wrights lived in the village of cottingley in west yorkshire where belief in fairies was still very much alive
the two young cousins often played beside the stream at the bottom of the garden hoping to see fairies
elsie was so determined to prove that fairies really existed that one day she borrowed her father 's camera and together with her cousin set out for the stream
the two girls came back 30 minutes later triumphant
they rushed into mr wright 's darkroom he was an amateur photographer and had set up one in his house and developed the picture they had taken
it showed little frances standing behind a bush on which four fairies were dancing
knowing his daughter 's artistic abilities arthur dismissed the photo as fake
undaunted two months later the girls borrowed the camera again
once again they were lucky
the picture they took showed elsie with a winged gnome
arthur thought the prank had now gone too far and forbade the girls from ever playing with his camera again
but his wife believed both pictures were authentic
two years later she attended a meeting of the theosophical society and at the end of it showed the pictures to the speaker who in turn displayed them in a conference
now that the pictures were out in the public eye proving their authenticity was more important than ever
edward gardner a leading member of the society sent the pictures and negatives to photographer expert harold snelling who declared that the two negatives are entirely genuine unfaked photographs
with no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models
however he did n't go as far as admit the pictures showed fairies but simply that these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time
it was good enough for gardner who started selling the pictures at his lecture
soon they caught the attention of sir arthur conan doyle
commissioned by the strand magazine to write an article on fairies he decided to use the pictures to accompany it
but first both men sought a second opinion on the authenticity of the photos this time from the photographic company kodak
although they said the photos showed no signs of being faked they also believed that this could not be taken as conclusive evidence that they were authentic photographs of fairies and therefore refused to issue a certificate of authenticity
ilford another photographic company who had examined the photos was clearer the pictures showed some evidence of faking
but this opinion was quickly dismissed
next gardner went to visit the wrights and found them an honest and respectable family
he encouraged the cousins to take more pictures of the fairies and they readily complied
one of the new pictures showed frances standing very close to a fairy another fairy offering elsie a flower and a final one a bunch of fairies
both garden and doyle were ecstatic
doyle who hoped the pictures may convince people that psychic phenomena were real published his articles on fairies in the december 1920 issue of the strand
it quickly sold out
the pictures were received with a mixture of embarrassment and puzzlement
many thought they were fake because the fairies looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales and sported very fashionable hairstyles
but many others were willing to believe in their authenticity
but elsie and frances were by now tired of this fairy business and after 1921 so was the public
interest started to wane
elsie and frances both married and for many years they lived abroad
elsie was back in england in 1966 when a reporter from the daily express newspaper tracked her down
this time elsie said the pictures were photographs of figments of our imagination
public interest was rekindled and although the girls stated they had n't fabricated the photos these were examined again and found to be fake
finally in 1983 the cousins admitted the pictures were fakes
they had copied illustrations of dancing girls from princess mary 's gift book a popular children 's book of the time and drew wings on them
then they cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with hatpins
once the photos were taken the fake fairies were thrown in the stream
however they both insisted they had really seen fairies and frances even claimed the last photo showing only the fairies was indeed real
they agreed though on why they allowed the hoax to go on for so long two village kids and a brilliant man like conan doyle well we could only keep quiet
 frances added i never even thought of it as being a fraud it was just elsie and i having a bit of fun and i ca n't understand to this day why they were taken in they wanted to be taken in
