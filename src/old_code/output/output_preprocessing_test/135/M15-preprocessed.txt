natural history creation and religious conflicts wednesday 3 june 2015 sherlock holmes fairies and our imagination sherlock holmes is the most famous fictional detective in the world first appearing in a series of short stories in the strand magazine
as a result his inventor sir arthur conan doyle is afforded the respect of a near infallible sleuth
however there was one case reported by conan doyle that showed some flaws his support for the reality of the cottingley fairies named after the village in yorkshire where they were supposedly seen
in 1920 conan doyle wrote an article in the strand magazine 1 supporting the view that two photographs of fairies taken by two young girls were real and not faked
to protect the identity of the girls he used pseudonyms in his article and thus in the captions to the two photographs shown below
one is labelled alice and the fairies taken in july 1917 and the other iris and the dancing gnome taken in september 1917 when frances griffiths alice who was just 10 years old was staying with her 16 year old cousin elsie wright iris
elsie used her father 's recently acquired plate camera to take the first photograph and the second was taken using the same camera presumably by frances
the images intrigued conan doyle when he saw them three years later prompting his article
he was convinced that the fairies in the photographs were real and three further plates taken later gave further evidence for his conviction
conan doyle summarised his views and those of others in his book the coming of the fairies
2 that appeared in 1922 and contains the article from the christmas 1920 edition of the strand magazine
several points from the article that i have read in the original are worth elaborating
much centres on a report by mr edward l gardner a member of the executive committee of the theosophical society who met with the girls and other members of the family after he was shown the photographs in 1920
mr gardner consulted experts in photography who confirmed that they were genuine he visited the spots where they were taken and he met members of the family
his conclusion was extraordinary and amazing as these photographs may appear i am now quite convinced of their entire genuineness as indeed would everyone else be who had the same evidence of transparent honesty and simplicity that i had
that was good enough for conan doyle who as a spiritualist wanted to accept the evidence at face value
however the investigative side of his nature so evident in sherlock holmes provided a note of caution
this was his conclusion after seeing the two photographs there is one point of mr gardner 's investigation that should be mentioned
it had come to our knowledge that iris
16 year old elsie could draw and had actually at one time done some designs for a jeweller
this naturally demanded caution though the girl 's own frank nature is i understand a sufficient guarantee for those who know her
mr gardner however tested her powers of drawing and found that while she could do landscapes cleverly the fairy figures which she had attempted in imitation of those she had seen were entirely uninspired and bore no possible resemblance to those in the photograph other well authenticated cases will come along
these little folk who appear to be our neighbours with only some small difference of vibration to separate us will become familiar the thought of them even when unseen will add a charm to every brook and valley and give romantic interest to every country walk
the recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud and will make it admit that there is a glamour and a mystery to life
like many adherents of clairvoyance etc conan doyle suggests that those with supernatural powers are able to see such apparitions when those without such skills can not 2
a propensity to see things is thus a prerequisite for witnessing them and this must apply to all apparitions whether they are ghosts little people or even the virgin mary
there are still those who believe the cottingley fairies existed and plenty more that have sympathy with the views expressed in the last paragraph above
however the photographs were the result of a hoax as revealed in an interview by joe cooper with elsie and frances a few years ago 3
it is interesting that conan doyle himself was close to solving the mystery
in the strand magazine article he writes this about the first photograph 
the two upheld hands of the elves in the first photograph seen under a high power do not appear to be human nor does the left foot of the figure capering on the right
the hands seem furred at the edges and the fingers to be in a solid mass
this also may be due to movement and position but it is curious that both hands give the same impression
the figures were cut out from a book and it was not possible to cut round each finger so the whole hand appeared rather solid
each figure was then fastened to a hat pin and inserted into the ground in front of frances
conan doyle 's deduction did not go this far as he wanted the fairies to be real and this overcame his doubt
according to experts fairies come in many forms 4,5 in addition to those like the cottingley fairies that are the common type of benevolent creatures made popular in countless illustrations and films
as katharine briggs remarks in a section of her book dealing with whimsy 4]:when they were given butterfly and dragonfly wings they were reduced to almost the status of insects and in the sheltered days of the early twentieth century every care was taken to render them unalarming
briggs remarks that this tradition of fairies being winged had been in existence for over 200 years and probably originated when insects were being observed and human imaginations then left to run riot
an example can be given in a quote from a correspondent in seeing fairies by marjorie t. johnson 5]:my sister was standing near the snapdragon plant in our garden when she saw a movement on it and a tiny fairy flew out and settled on her arm for an instant perhaps trying to show her gratitude to my sister for putting the stake
that supported the plant there in the first place
when i asked for a description my sister said she did n't look more than one and a half inches high and was silvery with small silver wings 
so in the view of those that believe in fairies where do they fit into evolution conan doyle gives us the opinion of edward gardner the theosophist fairies are not born and do not die as we do though they have their periods of outer activity and retirement
allied to the lepidoptera or butterfly genus of our familiar acquaintance rather than to the mammalian line they partake of certain characteristics that are obvious
there is little or no mentality awake simply a gladsome irresponsible joyousness of life that is abundantly in evidence in their enchanting abandon
the diminutive human form so widely assumed is doubtless due at least in a great measure to the powerful influence of human thought the strongest creative power in our cycle 
the wings are a feature that one would hardly expect to find in conjunction with arms
in this respect the insect type with its several limbs and two or more wings is a nearer model
but there is no articulation and no venation and moreover the wings are not used for flying
in contrast one of marjorie johnson 's correspondents reports that wingless fairies can soar through the air quite effortlessly but 
it is possible that they fairies have evolved from butterflies since they attach so much importance to the use of their wings 
fairies which are fully materialized fly like butterflies by the power of their densified wings
conan doyle 1 wrote that a 
general observation is that the elves are a compound of the human and the butterfly while the gnome has more of the moth
 confusing is n't it there seems to be agreement that fairies evolved from butterflies but what about the fairies with dragonfly wings
what were the steps in evolution that led to these insects creatures having the appearance of a human body
we know that it is impossible for human like figures to fly with insect wings just as it is for angels to fly with bird wings
6 so do those that believe in wood and water spirits of which fairies are a part view them as part of evolution on earth or as something completely supernatural like angels
for those that do not believe in a supernatural there is no problem except puzzlement at the level of imagination shown by all humans in what we believe
