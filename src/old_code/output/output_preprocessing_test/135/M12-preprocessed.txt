welcome to the official frances griffiths site
an official book has just been published containing the memoir ’s of frances griffiths the nine year old girl in the famous photograph named by sir arthur conan doyle as the fairy ring
frances was nine in the summer of 1917 and twelve in 1920 when she saw fairies in the beck that ran behind the house in cottingley where she was living with her mother her aunt polly cousin elsie and uncle arthur wright
this is a first hand account of that momentous event
the first time that either frances or her cousin elsie have put down their experiences in writing and this is also the very first time that the fifth photograph the only ever photograph taken of real fairies the fairy bower has been seen in colour
the fairy bower in colour was made from one of the 15 lantern slides tinted in 1920 by a photographic studio in wealdstone middlesex owned by a mr snelling on the instructions of sir arthur conan doyle and edward gardner
the loveliest of the five fairies in that extraordinary photograph can be seen on the front cover of the book reflections of the cottingley fairies frances griffiths in her own words
it was taken at a distance of only three feet
the fairy can be seen looking directly at frances although she was not aware of it
frances only saw what looked like a cocoon in the middle of a nest of grass when she took a snap with the camera given her by sir arthur conan doyle
when the negative reached snelling ’s studio misty images on the plate were strengthened and to the astonishment of everyone five transparent images of fairies were discovered
even more amazing wings can be seen outlined against the skyline
there appear to be many more fairies deeper into the grasses and harebells
this extraordinary coloured photograph will soon be available on an a3 poster check back soon for more details
