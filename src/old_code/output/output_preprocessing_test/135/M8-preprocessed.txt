transcriptsletter one dear miss elsie wrighti have seen the wonderful pictures of the fairies which you and your cousin frances have taken and i have not been so interested for a long time
i will send you tomorrow one of my little books for i am sure you are not too old to enjoy adventures
i am going to australia soon but i only wish before i go that i could get to bradford and have half an hours chat with you for i should like to hear all about it
with best wishes yours sincerely arthur conan doyle mr gardner told me about it
letter two
dear mr. wright i have seen the very interesting photos which your little girl took
they are certainly amazing
i was writing a little article for the strand upon the evidence for the existence of fairies so that i was very much interested
i should naturally like to use the photos along with other material in my article but would not of course do so without your knowledge and permission
it would be in the xmas number
i suggest1
that no name be mentioned so that neither you nor your daughter be annoyed in any way
2 that the use be reserved for the strand only until xmas
after that it reverts of course to you
3 that either £ 5 be paid to you by the strand for the temporary use or that if you do n't care to take money you be put on the free list of the magazine for five years
the articles appear in america in connection with the strand publication
i would if you agree try to get you another £ 5 from that side
if this is all agreeable to you i or my friend mr gardner would try to run up have half an hours chat with the girls yours sincerelya conan doyle
