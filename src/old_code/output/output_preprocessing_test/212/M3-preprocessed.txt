adebayo oyagbola rated it although we know from the get go the name of the man who fired the fatal shot that killed spencer perceval this is a whodunit in the classical sense
it sets out to discover the shadowy figures behind the presumed conspiracy to assassinate the prime minister
as conspiracy theories go it is a highly unlikely story one that converts the possible at every turn into not only the plausible or probable but indeed the proven
the narrative turns logic upside down and decides that because a scenario could have transpired it did happen unless proof is shown that it did not
nevertheless the book has indisputable and unalloyed benefit
it sets out as no other book i have read has done an account not only of the parliamentary battles that led to the abolition of slavery but indeed of the practical steps that were required to give effect to the abolitionist 's humane and providential fervour
it also shows how a humourless and witless belief in predestination may have been responsible for the defeat of the peril that napoleon constituted
all told it is a book replete with arcane historical titbits but one that tells a weak story
nevertheless well worth reading
