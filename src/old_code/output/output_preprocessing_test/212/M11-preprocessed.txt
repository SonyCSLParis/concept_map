blood in the house of commons
two hundred years on the shocking story of spencer perceval the only british pm to have been assassinated by miles goslettpublished 13:54 gmt 1 may 2012 | updated 06:33 gmt 2 may 2012
at around 5 o'clock on the afternoon of may 11 1812 the tory prime minister spencer perceval walked into the lobby of the palace of westminster for what would be the last time
his family he had six sons and six daughters with his wife jane had begged him not to go to parliament that day
perhaps they had had some premonition of the horror to come
but perceval a conscientious deeply honourable man felt that he had a duty to attend a debate being held in the house of commons into the conduct of the government
as he entered the lobby on his way to the chamber his colleague lord osborne walking a few steps behind him a man who had been sitting quietly next to a fireplace nearby suddenly stood up and approached perceval
when he neared him the man reached into a pocket of his overcoat and whipped out a pistol
before the startled perceval had time to react the man had shot him through the heart at point blank range
according to eyewitness accounts perceval a tiny man of five feet four inches lurched forward a few steps uttering murder or i am murdered in a barely audible gasp
he then fell flat on his face at the feet of william smith the mp for norwich who had been speaking to a colleague nearby
smith later admitted that he did not recognise perceval until he knelt down to help him
as the stricken prime minister lay there a few convulsive sobs escaping from his mouth blood seeped through his clothing and on to the floor
seeing how seriously perceval was hurt smith and another man picked him up and carried him to the speaker ’s apartments
smith recalled at the inquest into perceval 's death we set him on a table he resting on our arms
i think he was not only speechless but perfectly senseless and blood came from his mouth
his pulse in a few minutes ceased and he soon died
someone had sent for a surgeon mr lynn of neighbouring great george street but by the time he arrived it was too late
it is highly unlikely he could have done anything for perceval in any case
the musket ball was so large it had passed completely through perceval ’s heart making him the only premier in british history to be assassinated in office
downstairs in the lobby meanwhile about 30 or 40 people had gathered at the scene having heard the pistol ’s report
all of parliament ’s doors had been locked to prevent the gunman escaping
but there was no need
the assassin having discharged his shot had walked calmly back to the fireplace and sat down again
as the contemporary journalist edward baines noted when a spectator at last exclaimed where is the villain who fired a person who had remained unobserved stepped forward and coolly said i am the unfortunate man he was seized and his pistol was taken
another pistol was also found on him primed and loaded presumably in case the first had misfired
now the assassin ’s coolness appeared to desert him
as a small crowd surrounded him he began sweating profusely and appeared to have difficulty breathing
some in the crowd recognized him
was he not the man who had been in the gallery some weeks before asking the identities of various ministers as they spoke had he not been hanging around the lobby accosting ministers as they walked through slinking away disappointed when they brushed off his entreaties
he was soon identified as john bellingham a bankrupt businessman who bore a deep grudge against the government which he felt had betrayed him
with that single shot he plunged britain into shock turned perceval ’s wife into a widow and left his twelve children without a father
amazingly however for an institution which prides itself on tradition and in so many respects keeps history alive four patterned floor tiles at the place where perceval fell are the sole commemoration to his killing within the palace of westminster identifiable only because they face in the opposite direction to the rest of the tiling in that part of the commons
apart from these obscure markings there is not so much as a discreet plaque there to inform people of this momentous event let alone a statue of the diminutive perceval earning him the nickname the forgotten prime minister
now as the 200th anniversary of his death approaches it has come to light that today ’s westminster authorities are no keener than their predecessors to pay a meaningful tribute to the only british leader of modern times who has made the ultimate sacrifice
a group of parliamentarians including poignantly the assassin 's ancestor henry bellingham a tory mp have been forced to organise their own special ceremony for perceval this month after learning that official plans to remember him on may 11 centre around updating the parliamentary twitter feed and posting some new pages on the parliamentary website
crossbench peer lord laird of artigarvan who is finalising the details of a more meaningful event for perceval has dismissed parliament ’s electronic offerings as completely inappropriate
lord laird told the mail a group of us believe that this anniversary calls for a little more than a twitter feed
we 're proposing to hold a ceremony at midday on may 11 so we can lay a wreath at the place where spencer perceval was shot
we 're going to mark his death in the appropriate way
perceval was the only prime minister to be assassinated in office
he died serving his country
it 's a very poor show to remember him by a few floor tiles and the very ephemeral medium of twitter
longer term i would like to see a plaque or statue for perceval
henry bellingham supports laird ’s desire to honour the man whom his own relative murdered saying john bellingham did n’t have children but we share a common ancestor
so i feel strongly about this and the point that lord laird makes is a good one
spencer perceval was cut down in his prime
it ’s pretty shabby not to have anything more substantial to commemorate his premiership and two hundred years on seems a good time to correct this
on may 11 i intend to be at the ceremony
it ’s a time for the percevals to forgive the bellinghams and to make sure that spencer perceval is properly recognised
ironically henry bellingham is now a minister for the foreign office the very government department whose callous treatment of john bellingham provoked him to commit murder
at his trial at the old bailey just a few days after the crime 35 year old bellingham revealed that he had harboured a grievance against the british government because while working in the city of archangel in russia in 1804 he was imprisoned for around four years as a result of his involvement in a shipping dispute
the british ambassador in russia lord granville leveson gower failed to come to his aid although the charges were almost certainly trumped up
bellingham was a british subject falsely imprisoned his life in danger
yet the british embassy ignored his plight leaving him to rot for nearly six years in a rat infested cell surviving on bread and water
unsurprisingly when he was finally released in 1809 bellingham was imbued with bitterness against the foreign office and the government as a whole who had abandoned him to his fate
during his time in prison his business had collapsed and he became bankrupt
for more than two years he petitioned the foreign office demanding financial compensation from the government for failing to support or repatriate him
but his pleas were ignored or rejected
in desperation he visited the house of commons and hung about the lobby where he would accost mps and ask for their help but few bothered to listen to him let alone help him
he is thought to have approached spencer perceval several times but perceval a busy man did not stop to listen to him
snubbed frustrated desperate and obsessed at what he saw as his betrayal by the highest in the land bellingham began to harbour thoughts of revenge
in march 1812 he told police magistrates that if he was again refused help by the government he would feel justified in executing justice myself
they ignored him
after petitioning the foreign office for a final time in april 1812 bellingham began to plot perceval ’s murder
he acquired the pair of pistols and asked a london tailor to make a secret nine inch deep pocket in his overcoat where he could conceal them
then he went to parliament and lay in wait
straight after the murder bellingham was arrested and held in the parliament prison cell
within a few hours he was transferred to newgate prison
his trial on may 15 was a swift affair
the jury took just over ten minutes to find him guilty
he was sentenced to death by hanging and executed publicly in london on may 18 only a week after the crime
while perceval ’s family had seen justice done his death left them almost destitute
although perceval was the younger son of the earl of egmont he had not been a wealthy man
on his death it was discovered that the 49 year old had only £ 106 5s 1d in the bank so parliament voted to award his 12 surviving children a grant of £ 50,000 and an annual sum of £ 2,000 to his widow
his eldest son also called spencer was given £ 1,000 yearly
perceval ’s official title was first lord of the treasury the title of prime minister was not then in use and although not an outstanding premier he was a competent decent man who had steered the country through the upheaval of the napoleonic wars abroad and social instability at home brought on by the industrial revolution
after his murder public monuments to him were erected in northampton his parliamentary seat at lincoln ’s inn where he was called to the bar in 1786 and in westminster abbey
his friends among them william wilberforce the anti slavery campaigner wanted to erect a monument to him in the house of commons but some members of the whig party opposed it and in the end nothing was done
according to henry bellingham he deserves better
he has gone down in history as the man who never had the chance to prove his great potential
we hope there will be a way of securing funding for a statue or plaque and advancing this cause
surely henry bellingham argues even perceval 's detractors would admit that he should be more than just a footnote in history and is deserving of a proper acknowledgement at westminster on the anniversary of his assassination
mr bellingham said perceval had n’t really had time to get going but he wasn‘t a bad prime minister
it ’s odd it ’s a big oversight not to have any formal commemoration to him
there may have been something in the old house of commons before 1834 when the big fire took place but this should be addressed soon
it ’s completely inadequate not to have some sort of memorial to him
as well as updating its twitter feed and website on may 11 the parliamentary archives which is in charge of the perceval commemoration for both houses will mark the assassination with a display of records and artwork in the royal gallery between may and mid august
and on the anniversary itself there will also be a lunchtime talk by the clerk of the records
but lord laird and the rest of his cross party group says it is important to dignify perceval with a proper personal ceremony on may 11 and he would like to hear from anyone who believes they might be related to perceval so that they can attend it
lord laird said i 'm appealing to anyone who thinks they are a descendant of spencer perceval to contact me at the house of lords
bellingham 's relation will be there
it would be a very nice touch if some of perceval 's relatives could come too
it 's a great pity that parliament has failed to understand the full significance of this
perceval paid the greatest price for being prime minister
we will seek permission to start at st stephen 's entrance and walk up to the tiles and lay flowers where perceval fell
as for the future we believe he should be remembered more permanently
