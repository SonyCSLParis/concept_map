archaeologists in jerusalem may have just solved one of the city 's greatest geographical mysteries
excavators recently unearthed what they think are the ruins of the acra a fortress constructed more than 2,000 years ago by the greek ruler antiochus iv epiphanes 215 164 b.c.
at one time mercenary soldiers and hellenized jews controlled the ancient fortress enforcing a brutal rule over jerusalem 's residents
the acra 's existence is recorded in historical documents but archaeologists and historians have debated its location
see images of the greek citadel and relics]the religious book of maccabees and a work by historian flavius josephus seemed to point to the city of david
flavius josephus in his antiquities of the jews 12:252â€“253 wrote and when he had overthrown the city walls he built a citadel
greek acra in the lower part of the city for the place was high and overlooked the temple on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a garrison of macedonians
 even so experts argued that flavius interpretation of the city of david may not be the modern city of david which is considered the eastern hill in jerusalem where the temple mount sits
jerusalem 's western hill is the larger of the city 's two main hills
and until now archaeologists and historians had remained unsure about where in the ancient city they might unearth the massive citadel
in recent months excavators working at the city of david archaeological site in jerusalem walls national park uncovered a huge section of wall as well as a 65 foot tall 20 meters tower
they also excavated a sloping embankment at the base of the wall known as a glacis the embankment was designed to keep attackers away from the base of the acra
relics from ancient battles surrounded the unearthed ruins
lead slingshots bronze arrowheads and ballista stones all stamped with a trident the symbol of antiochus epiphanes reign were dug up next to the massive wall
these small artifacts tell the story of the animosity between ancient jerusalem 's jewish residents and the greek controlled citadel
the archaeologists involved in the excavation including doron ben ami of the israel antiquities authority iaa invited other archaeologists to visit the site and offer their comments
we were very interested in their opinions and once we had everything presented in front of all our colleagues and experts and we had many conversations they felt confident in presenting their discovery to the public ben ami said
i must admit that there was one historian that in 1989 bezalel bar kochba who based on historical and linguistic and other documentation suggested this location exactly where we found it today he told live science
the acra was built specifically to control access to the temple mount a jewish holy site said ben ami yana tchekhanovets and salome cohen excavation directors with the iaa
the stronghold controlled all means of approach to the temple atop the temple mount and cut the temple off from the southern parts of the city they said in a statement
coins found within the acra 's unearthed wall show that the citadel remained intact from the reign of antiochus iv epiphanes until the reign of antiochus vii 139 129 b.c.
but the mercenaries and the hellenized jews who resided in the acra were defeated in 141 b.c. after a prolonged siege which left the greek garrison without access to food
simon maccabeus one of the brothers in the hasmonean family who led the maccabean revolt against the greeks spearheaded this celebrated siege
the discovery of the acra is a dream come true for archaeologists who have been speculating on the citadel 's location for 100 years the iaa said
not only have they found the elusive fortress but the discovery also reveals what jerusalem was like before the hasmoneans took over after the revolt
because we have located the acra on the city of david the implication is that the city was not larger than the city of david and the acra dominated the entire city the entire eastern hill ben ami said
the archaeologists will continue to excavate and investigate the ruins
in addition because the site is so large ben ami said they can also dig to deeper layers in other areas of the site
that way the archaeologists can look even further back in time in the same area
