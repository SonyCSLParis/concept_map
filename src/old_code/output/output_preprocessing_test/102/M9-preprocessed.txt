simon maccabeus by richard gottheil samuel krauss hasmonean prince and high priest died 135 b.c. second son of mattathias
in i macc
ii 3 he is called thassi in josephus ant xii 6 31 thatis with the variant matthes
the meanings of these names are obscure
his father when dying praised him as a man of counsel and exhorted his four brothers to heed his advice
simon justified his father 's high opinion of him and proved himself uniformly sagacious and circumspect
even during the lifetime of his brothers judah and jonathan simon took a prominent part in the war of liberation waged against the syrians he succored the hard pressed jews in galilee avenged in conjunction with jonathan the death of his brother john and fought successfully against bacchides i macc

strategus
the successes of the jews rendered it expedient for the pretenders to the throne of syria to show them special favor and therefore antiochus vi appointed simon strategus or military commander of the coast region from the ladder of tyre to egypt
as strategus simon conquered the cities of beth zur and joppa garrisoning them with jewish troops and built the fortress of adida in the plain i macc

after the capture of jonathan simon was elected leader µe by the people assembled at jerusalem he at once completed the fortification of the capital and made joppa secure by expelling its gentile inhabitants and filling it with jews i macc xiii

at hadid he blocked the advance of the treacherous trypho who was attempting to enter the country and seize the throne of syria
since trypho could gain nothing by force he craftily demanded a ransom for jonathan and the surrender of jonathan 's sons as hostages
although simon was fully aware that trypho would deceive him he acceded to both demands so that the people might see that he had done everything possible for his brother
jonathan was nevertheless treacherously assassinated and the hostages were not returned
simon thus became the sole leader of the people
he had jonathan 's remains buried with honor at modin where he subsequently erected a monument to him i macc xiii

coins
as the opponent of trypho simon had every reason to side with demetrius ii to whom he sent a deputation requesting freedom from taxation for the country
the fact that his request was granted implied the recognition of the political independence of judea
thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from israel in the hundred and seventieth year of the seleucid era 143 142 b.c. i macc xiii

the statement found in a rabbinical work meg ta'an
2 that judah and jerusalem were released from the payment of the crown tax st?fa on iyyar 27 may refer to this event
the jews then introduced a new era dating all their instruments and contracts according to the years of simon
the independence of simon may be indicated also by the coins which he minted for many jewish shekels and half shekels bear in old hebrew characters the inscription holy jerusalem and are dated variously the year 1 2 3 4 or 5 these dates being referred by many scholars to the era of simon
but it is strange that there are no coins so far as known of the years 6 and 7 although simon was ruling then
these coins which are somewhat crude andprimitive are differentiated from other maccabean coins by the absence of the name of the ruling prince see illustrations in jew encyc s.v numismatics it is therefore not certain that they were struck by simon and schürer is particularly disinclined to ascribe them to his reign gesch

simon was still confronted with the task of securing his position in the country
he therefore laid siege to the old and powerful city of gazara and captured it after which he expelled the pagan inhabitants removed the idols from the houses purified the city and placed such men there as would keep the law i macc xiii 43 48 comp xiv 34 ant xiii 6 7 strabo p. 759
he then attacked the last bulwark of the syrians in judea the acra of jerusalem which was taken on the 23d day of the second month 142 b.c. and entered by the jews chanting hymns of thanksgiving to the sound of harps and bearing palm branches i macc xiii 49 52 comp xiv 7 36 37 ant l.c
merited punishment was visited on the hellenists called children of the acra in meg ta'an

in this connection although the actual work was probably done at a later time josephus speaks ant l.c comp

it is hardly likely that the fortifications were permitted during this time to command the temple yet they must have remained standing for simon is said to have garrisoned them i macc xiv 37 comp xv 28
at the same time he placed his son john who resided at gazara in charge of a portion of the army ib xiii 53
alliance with rome
the country now enjoyed a lasting peace and the author of the first book of maccabees xiv 8 15 describes the felicity of the people in glowing colors adhering closely to the accounts of the blessings promised in the bible and carefully including simon 's services to religion
he then speaks of the honor shown the jewish people by other nations declaring xiv 16 19 that the romans renewed their friendship with the jews on their own initiative although this is improbable and that the spartans at the request of the jews made a documentary declaration of their friendship xiv 20 23
willrich regards this record as spurious like others of a similar nature
the statement xiv 24 that simon sought to win the favor of the romans by rich gifts through the agency of numenius is apparently incorrect for the friendship of rome has already been noted in a previous passage
an alliance amicitia between the romans and the jews is however mentioned in other sources justin apologia xxxvi 3 9
hereditary prince
the high esteem in which simon was held by foreign powers impelled the people to show their appreciation of him and on elul 18 141 b.c. the assembly of the priests the people the leaders of the people and the elders of the land resolved that simon should be the high priest strategus and ethnarch of the jews forever until there should arise a faithful prophet i macc
xiv 41
by this phrase they probably intended to imply that the time would come when the spirit of prophecy would again appear in israel enabling them to learn the will of god or they may have meant to express their conviction that the prophet elijah would announce the messiah who would belong to the house of david and in that case there could of course be no ruler but him
this resolution was inscribed upon brass tablets and set up in the court of the temple
according to willrich this record can not have been quoted in the original text of the maccabees since the inscription states that simon sent his deputation to rome before he was recognized by demetrius and regards the roman alliance as the motive for this confirmation whereas xiv
3 asserts that demetrius was taken prisoner by the parthians before the embassy went to rome furthermore numenius is said xv 15 to have returned in 139 138 when antiochus sidetes was already on the throne
whether the inscription is authentic or not it is at least certain that simon bequeathed his dignities to his children and thus became the founder of the hasmonean dynasty
war with the syrians
once more simon became involved in the syrian imbroglio
antiochus vii sidetes the brother of the captive demetrius attempted to seize the throne of syria in a letter written at rhodes before he landed on the asiatic coast he confirmed simon in all the privileges granted him by previous kings especially in the prerogative of coinage i macc xv
1 9 although this was apparently a mere sanction of the actual state of affairs
but as soon as antiochus felt secure from trypho he changed his attitude
at the siege of dora he rejected the reenforcements sent by simon and demanded either that simon should surrender joppa gazara and the acra which he alleged had been wrongfully taken by the jews or that he should pay an indemnity of one thousand talents
the result was a war in which the syrians under cendebeus were defeated by simon 's sons judah and john 136 b.c.
the age of simon had led him to entrust this war to his sons but the hope which he may have cherished that in his old age at least he would be able to enjoy the reward of his deeds was doomed to disappointment
in 135 b.c. simon the last of the maccabean brothers died by violence
according to his custom he was traveling through the country holding court when in the fortress of docus near jericho he and his sons mattathias and judah were slain by his son in law ptolemeus at a banquet prepared by the last mentioned i macc xvi

the seven short years of his reign prepared the way for the events of the following one hundred years
he was succeeded by his son john hyrcanus i.
