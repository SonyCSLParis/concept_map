antiochus iv epiphanes greek god manifest also called antiochus epimanes the mad born c. 215 bc died 164 tabae iran seleucid king of the hellenistic syrian kingdom who reigned from 175 to 164 bc
as a ruler he was best known for his encouragement of greek culture and institutions
his attempts to suppress judaism brought on the wars of the maccabees
early career antiochus was the third son of antiochus iii the great
after his father ’s defeat by the romans in 190–189 he served as hostage for his father in rome from 189 to 175 where he learned to admire roman institutions and policies
his brother king seleucus iv exchanged him for demetrius the son of seleucus and after seleucus was murdered by heliodorus a usurper antiochus in turn ousted him
during this period of uncertainty in syria the guardians of ptolemy vi the egyptian ruler laid claim to coele syria palestine and phoenicia which antiochus iii had conquered both the syrian and egyptian parties appealed to rome for help but the senate refused to take sides
in 173 antiochus paid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the romans on antiochus iii at the treaty of apamea 188
antiochus forestalled an egyptian expedition to palestine by invading egypt
he defeated the egyptians between pelusium and mount kasion conquered pelusium and in 169 occupied egypt with the exception of alexandria the capital
ptolemy vi was antiochus nephew antiochus sister cleopatra i had married ptolemy v and antiochus contented himself with ruling egypt as ptolemy ’s guardian giving rome no excuse for intervention
the citizens of alexandria however appealed to ptolemy viii the brother of ptolemy vi and to his sister cleopatra ii to form a rival government
disturbances in palestine forced antiochus to return to syria but he safeguarded his access to egypt with a strong garrison in pelusium
in the winter of 169/168 perseus of macedonia in vain begged antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that rome presented to all of the hellenistic monarchs
in egypt ptolemy vi made common cause with his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to rome for aid and antiochus prepared for battle
the fleet of antiochus won a victory at cyprus whose governor surrendered the island to him
antiochus invaded egypt again in 168 demanded that cyprus and pelusium be ceded to him occupied lower egypt and camped outside alexandria
the cause of the ptolemaeans seemed lost
but on june 22 168 the romans defeated perseus and his macedonians at pydna and there deprived antiochus of the benefits of his victory
in eleusis a suburb of alexandria the roman ambassador gaius popillius laenas presented antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate egypt and cyprus immediately
antiochus taken by surprise asked for time to consider popillius however drew a circle in the earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before antiochus left the circle
dismayed by this public humiliation the king quickly agreed to comply
roman intervention had reestablished the status quo
by being allowed to retain southern syria to which egypt had laid claim antiochus was able to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm
efforts to hellenize the kingdom both economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom inhabited in the main by orientals non greeks of asia minor and persia)—by founding and fostering greek cities
even before he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of zeus in athens and to the adornment of the theatre
he enlarged antioch on the orontes by adding a section to the city named epiphania after him
there he built an aqueduct a council hall a marketplace and a temple to jupiter capitolinus babylon which revered him as soter liberator or saviour of asia was given a greek colony that was granted freedom of the city
another epiphania was founded in armenia
ecbatana in persia was also named epiphania and became a greek city
many of these cities were granted the right to coin their own municipal currency
the mint of antioch on the persian gulf served the trade along the sea route between india and the district at the mouth of the great mesopotamian rivers
antiochus hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous oriental temple organizations and particularly with the jews
since antiochus iii ’s reign the jews had enjoyed extensive autonomy under their high priest
they were divided into two parties the orthodox hasideans pious ones and a reform party that favoured hellenism
for financial reasons antiochus supported the reform party and in return for a considerable sum permitted the high priest jason to build a gymnasium in jerusalem and to introduce the greek mode of educating young people
in 172 for an even bigger tribute he appointed menelaus in place of jason
in 169 however while antiochus was campaigning in egypt jason conquered jerusalem with the exception of the citadel and murdered many adherents of his rival menelaus
when antiochus returned from egypt in 167 he took jerusalem by storm and enforced its hellenization
the city forfeited its privileges and was permanently garrisoned by syrian soldiers
the revolt of judas maccabeus the greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of antiochians the worship of yahweh and all of the jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death
in the temple an altar to zeus olympios was erected and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the king
against that desecration judas maccabeus leader of the anti greek jews led the aroused hasideans in a guerrilla war and several times defeated the generals antiochus had commissioned to deal with the uprising
judas refused a partial amnesty conquered judaea with the exception of the acra in jerusalem and in december 164 was able to tear down the altar of zeus and reconsecrate the temple
antiochus apparently had underestimated the strength of the hasidean movement which was behind the success in maintaining an independent judaean state for about a century
the fighting spirit of the jews was all the more impressive because at the beginning of their rebellion in 166 antiochus had just demonstrated his might to the world at daphne near antioch with a grand review of his army 46,000 foot soldiers were on parade among them a macedonian phalanx of 20,000 men and 500 mercenaries equipped with roman arms followed by 8,500 horsemen and 306 armoured elephants
antiochus then mounted a campaign against the parthians who were threatening the empire in the east recovered the income from that area forced artaxias of armenia who had defected to recognize his suzerainty founded the city of antioch on the persian gulf set out on an expedition to the arabian coast and at the end of 164 died of an illness at tabae or gabae probably present isfahan in persis
many believers saw his death as a punishment for his attempt to loot the shrine of nanaia in elam in modern iran
