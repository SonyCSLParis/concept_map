castlesthe term castle has been applied to structures as diverse as ancient hill forts and renaissance country houses
over the millennium that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features but in the popular mind castles feature a range of elements including battlements drawbridges and arrow slits
in its simplest terms the definition of a castle accepted amongst academics is a private fortified residence
this contrasts with earlier fortifications such as anglo saxon burhs and walled cities such as constantinople and antioch in the middle east castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lords either for themselves or for their monarch
historians enjoy debating the scope of the word but usually accept a castle to be the private fortified residence of a monarch or nobleman
this definition excludes fortresses which were not homes and also fortified towns which were public defences rather than private residences
taking a little licence we can extend the definition to buildings that might not technically qualify under this definition for example those built for show rather than defence those in which the nobleman rarely or never lived and those built by military orders
the word castle is derived from the latin word castellum which is a diminutive of the word castrum meaning fortified place
the old english castel french château spanish castillo italian castello and a number of other words in other languages also derive from castellum
the word castle was introduced into english shortly before the norman conquest to denote this type of building which was then new to england
although these various terms derive from the same root they are not universally applied to the same types of structures
for example the french château is used to describe a grand country house at the heart of an estate regardless of the presence of fortifications and a castle is denoted by the term chateau fort
the term castle has been used to refer to structures such as iron age fortifications for example maiden castle dorset
many castles were originally built from earth and timber but had their defences replaced later by stone
early castles often exploited natural defences and lacked features such as towers and arrow slits and relied on a central keep
castles served a range of purposes the most important of which were military administrative and domestic
during the first crusade 1096–1099 frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately referred to as castles but which would not be considered as such under the modern definition
in the late 12th and early 13th centuries a scientific approach to castle defence emerged
this led to the proliferation of towers with an emphasis on flanking fire
castles were established by norman invaders of england for both defensive purposes and to awe the country 's inhabitants
as william the conqueror advanced through england he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken
between 1066 and 1087 he established 36 castles to discourage rebellion
a castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a lord could entertain his peers
over time the aesthetics of the design became more important as the castle 's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant
comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls
towards the end of the middle ages castles tended to lose their military significance because of the advent of powerful cannons
although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences
most castles as we know them are found in europe and the middle east and date from the middle ages
the word castle comes from the latin castellum denoting a type of fortified structure
a european innovation castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the fall of the carolingian empire its territory being divided among multiple lords and princes
castles controlled the area immediately surrounding them and were offensive as well as defensive structures they provided a secure base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies
medieval warfare including the crusades featured many more sieges of castles than open battles
castle architecture evolved radically in step with evolving siege technology
although their military origins are often emphasised the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power
urban castles controled bothl important travel routes and the local populace
rural castles were often situated near to features that were integral to life such as ponds mills and fertile land
in some countries before a castle could be built it was necessary to obtain the permission of the king through a licence to crenellate or else the builder risked it being seized or slighted deliberately damaged to such an extent that the castle was indefensible
this practice was not universal in some countries the monarch had little control over lords or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission as was the case in england after 1066 and the holy land during the crusades
in england licences to crenellate were granted not only by the monarch but also other powerful rulers notably the prince bishop of durham in his position as prince of the palatinate of durham the earl of chester in his position as ruler of the palatinate of cheshire and after the formation of the palatinate of lancashire in 1351 the duke of lancaster
switzerland without a soveriegn monarch and a centralised state is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles and as a result there were 4,000 in the country
before the 12th century castles were as uncommon in denmark as they had been in england before the norman conquest
many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle 's firepower
these changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the crusades and inspiration from earlier defences such as roman forts
not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature and even those that were often become decorative symbols of power for example moats and machicolations
some grand castles had long winding approaches intended dominate the landscape and impress visitors
although gunpowder was introduced to europe in the 14th century it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls
while castles continued to be built well into the 16th century new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live
as a result true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration and by country houses that were generally indefensible
from the 18th century onwards there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles part of a romantic revival of gothic architecture but they had no military purpose
