the castles that we know today really began appearing from around 800 1000ad in europe
as more countries took on a feudal structure local lords and nobles began building castles to secure their hold over their particularl fiefdom
later castles began to be constructed in a more connected fashion by increasingly powerful kings developing more cohesive military systems a good example of this trend was seen after the norman conquest of england in 1066ad
castles were used to secure a military hold over an area as well as providing a base to both defend and launch attacking raids in un subdued territory
however these fortifications were also used as status symbols grand residences and even became vital administrative centres
in time castles sprang up throughout europe and with the advent of the crusades castles were increasingly common in the middle east and north africa
however the development of gunpowder based weaponry particularly artillery meant that the military importance of the castle declined and soon castles became militarily defunct
however the cachet associated with castles remained and many of the wealthier classes continued to build castles as grand private homes ensuring that the list of castles of the world we have today kept growing throughout the centuries
