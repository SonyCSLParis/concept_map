harewood castle the oldest building at harewood is harewood castle
a major programme of repair and consolidation of the surviving structure took place during 2004 and 2005 with financial support from english heritage and the harewood estate
a considerable body of new information both architectural and archaeological was gathered which has prompted a number of new interpretations as well as challenging some of the existing theories
a license to crenellate to fortify was granted to sir william de aldeburgh in 1366 shortly after he became lord of the manor of harewood
substantial earthworks around the ruins of the castle still only partially explored indicate there were earlier buildings on the site but de aldeburgh made a decision to demolish and replace whatever was there with something brand new fore shadowing gawthorpe hall and harewood house some 400 years later
harewood castle was designed to strike a balance between security and comfort a mixture of convenience and magnificence more accurately described as a fortified tower house than a castle
some of its features the portcullis over the main entrance the narrow arrow slit windows the remains of metal grilles over the larger windows indicate a concern for defence
others were primarily about comfort aesthetics or status
the mullioned and transomed window frames for example are fine examples of 14th century mason ’s skills and though the massively thick walls would have made the castle eminently defensible they also contained an elaborate network of internal walkways stairs and flues
even the dramatic setting on a steep north facing slope with spectacular views up and down wharfedale was as much about status as security early sighting of any approaching trouble certainly but also dominating the immediate landscape in a way designed to impress
surrounding it or attached to it would have been other buildings such as barns and stables as well as landscaped gardens designed for leisure as much as practicality
when de aldeburgh ’s son died in 1391 he left no male heir and the estate passed to his two daughters sybil and elizabeth
they and their husbands sir william ryther and sir richard redmayne shared occupation of the castle either simultaneously or in a 14th century version of time share an arrangement the two families continued for more than 200 years
the last resident was robert ryther who retired to his wife ’s family ’s estate in lincolnshire around 1630
by 1657 when the amalgamated harewood and gawthorpe estates were bought by sir john cutler the castle was falling down and uninhabitable
did the rythers simply lock the door and walk away leaving the building to its fate its stone and timbers to be cannibalized for use elsewhere on the estate its gardens to become neglected and overgrown its ornamental ponds to silt up and drain away
perhaps it had simply become too old fashioned unmanageable and uncomfortable to live in any more
nobody knows
