castlesearly castles were made of wood
during the 10th century people started to make them out of stone
the walls could be up to 30 feet thick
some castles had a moat around them and a draw bridge that would be let down if you wanted to get into or out of the castle
the bailey was the closed place around the inner part of a castle
if you wanted to attack a castle you would have to get by the bailey first
some castles were built on high mountains
this made it even harder for enemies to attack them
castles were also built along rivers at the shores of lakes and on hilltops
some castles were built near the sea so that defenders could see enemies who came by boat
there were holes in the walls of a castle so that the archers could shoot arrows at an enemy
the doors were made out of heavy iron so it was very difficult to open them
later on castles often had round walls which made them harder for the enemy to hit
