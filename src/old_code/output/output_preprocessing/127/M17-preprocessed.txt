medieval warfare how to capture a castle with siegecraft6/12/2006 gear mhqthe present day notion of medieval warfare is of longbowmen standing shoulder to shoulder loosing arrows and knights charging across open fields before engaging in brutal hand to hand battle
hastings bannockburn and agincourt come to mind
such battles however were the exception for during the middle ages warfare was a much more complicated affair that more often than not involved siegecraft
after his 1066 victory at hastings william the conqueror initiated a massive castle building program in england that was instrumental in completing the normans subjugation of the anglo saxons
throughout medieval europe and the middle east the castle functioned as a private fortress that among its other roles physically and symbolically proclaimed the status and strength of its lord to all comers friend or foe
even the simplest earth and timber motte and bailey castle used to great effect by the norman kings of england validated the power of the conquering force
during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries castles evolved into powerful fortresses capable of defying intensive assaults
at the same time in order to combat strengthened castle defenses siegecraft developed
by the late middle ages few major campaigns took place without at least one castle siege
indeed while battles such as crcy 1346 have gleaned all the glory it was not until the siege of calais in the following year that the english made significant progress in their fight against france
the successful castle siege skillfully combined sophisticated science with specific standards of conduct known to but not always practiced by the participants
ultimately the siege dominated medieval warfare for at least as long as the castle dominated the social and political order of the day
besieging a castle was a much more complicated affair than simply rushing into the breach as shakespeare ’s henry v exhorted his troops before the 1415 siege of harfleur
sieges likewise involved much more than bombarding a fortress until either the garrison surrendered or the defenses were overcome
in fact the medieval siege was a complex highly choreographed process that ended with a castle assault only when other tactics had failed to force a surrender
besieging a castle involved assembling and paying an army gathering supplies and hauling them to the siege site
because the costs were so high military leaders normally did not rush into a siege
indeed if a besieging army lost too many men in an initial onslaught it was often forced to retreat or give up the siege entirely
if it was successful enough to gain control of the castle the army ’s now weakened troops might not be capable of repulsing a renewed attack by forces sent to relieve the garrison
consequently the full out siege was normally a last resort unless of course the attacking king or lord had a particular investment in breaking his opponent
early medieval sieges were generally directed against towns or major cities which were often fortified rather than at individual castles
as castle sieges became more commonplace besiegers devised methods to overcome increasingly complex defenses
until about 1100 tactics mainly consisted of using firepower to break through the castle ’s physical defenses or of starving out the defenders by blockade
during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries siege warfare became increasingly sophisticated and by the mid fourteenth century enormous timber war machines had become the mainstay of virtually every investment
at the same time specific conventions for conducting a siege were well established
the most practiced soldiers followed traditional protocol which encouraged honorable negotiation and surrender before an attacker pummeled the garrison into submission
commanders first had to devise an overall strategy for taking the castle
they had to consider from where in the realm the best archers skilled carpenters blacksmiths sappers and engineers could be drawn
if a king was contemplating launching a siege he would consider which lords owed him knights service and how many men at arms they would provide knights normally were obligated to serve for forty days during the course of a year
other considerations included how much timber lead tools nails food drink livestock and other provisions were required for the duration of the siege and where they could be acquired
the preparations undertaken prior to the 1224 siege of bedford castle by hubert de burgh for king henry iii provide a case in point
first the archbishop of canterbury the king ’s advocate excommunicated the castle ’s garrison hoping to demoralize the defenders into surrendering
in the meantime the besiegers began to assemble vital materials laborers including miners carpenters and masons knights and other fighters
among the items required for the siege were iron hides charcoal leather and some nineteen thousand crossbow quarrels
the king ordered protective screens bolts hammers mallets wedges tents wax and a variety of spices
he also made sure that several siege engines were readied and that gynours or gunners were on hand to operate the machines
the most satisfying way to successfully conclude a battle was without fighting
indeed many more sieges were settled by negotiation bribery or forms of intimidation than open warfare
given the huge effort involved in coordinating a siege and assembling an army potential besiegers made at least cursory efforts to convince the garrison the constable or the lord of the castle to surrender peaceably
surrender under honorable terms was a common way out of a siege
in many cases the besiegers allowed the defenders a period of time ranging from a week to forty days to decide whether or not to give in
truces effectively delayed a full blown assault so that the constable could contact his lord for directions on how to handle the situation or to gain assistance at the castle
lengthy truces could also lead to the deterioration of the attacking army particularly when knights forty day service obligations neared completion and no reinforcements showed up to replace them
if members of a beleaguered garrison knew they had enough food and drink to carry them at least forty days or had notice that relief was on its way they knew they might survive the investment
truces also gave the defenders time to construct their own siege engines shore up their defenses and build wooden hoards or fighting platforms on the battlements
if the garrison refused surrender demands the siege began with an overt act by the attackers a symbolic sign of intent
at the siege of rhodes in 1480 for example muslim forces hoisted a black flag to warn their opponents that they would attack
at times attackers threw javelins or shot crossbow bolts at the castle gateway to signal their intentions
on occasion siege engines hurled missiles
by the late middle ages cannon fire signaled the beginning of sieges
when a garrison refused to surrender the balance of besieging forces would trek to the siege site set up their encampment and construct some basic defenses of their own not too far from the castle ’s walls
engineers would also begin erecting bulky intimidating siege engines
other soldiers fomented dissent in the surrounding countryside in an effort to recruit supporters and seize control of crops and other resources assuming landowners and peasants had not already torched them
it was common for inhabitants of an area to use a’scorched earth policy to sabotage an impending siege
after gathering food livestock and other items for their own use they intentionally burned their own lands to prevent the enemy from gaining any benefit from them
often the resulting famine left the besiegers no alternative but to retreat
in order to ease access to the castle attackers might first fill the strongpoint ’s surrounding dry ditch or wet moat with tree branches gorse heather loose earth or whatever else was available
alternatively they might sail a barge to the base of the castle ’s outer or curtain wall
once the ditch could be crossed or the moat forded the initial offensive could proceed rapidly
often relatively light the early assault primarily featured an escalade an attempt to scale the curtain wall by ladders
the key to an escalade was for the attackers to climb the ladders as quickly as possible leap onto the battlements and begin fighting the defenders
during this effort archers crossbowmen and slingers outside the castle provided protective fire for their comrades while shielding themselves behind screens known as pavises
the onrush would take place at several spots along the curtain wall in hopes of splitting up the garrison diverting attention and gaining access at whatever point might weaken
at the same time the besiegers assaulted the main gate ’s heavy timber doors and attempted to set afire any timber rooftops shielding castle towers
they might also begin hammering the masonry defenses with picks iron bars and other tools while protected inside a hide covered timber and iron framework known variously as a cat rat tortoise or turtle which had been wheeled to the castle wall
of course the defenders made every effort to thwart the escalade by shoving ladders away from the walls shooting at the besiegers and dropping stones quicklime or hot liquids upon them
it took nimble sure footed quick thinking men to maneuver their weighty armor and weapons and scale the walls successfully
at the siege of caen in 1346 sir edmund springhouse slipped off a ladder and fell into the ditch
french soldiers overhead swiftly tossed flaming straw on top of the englishman and burned him alive
during the siege of smyrna turkey also in the fourteenth century one of the besiegers climbed halfway up a ladder
when he rested and took off his helmet to see how much farther he had to climb to reach the top a crossbow bolt shot from the battlements hit him between the eyes killing him
if an escalade proved successful the besiegers would chivalrously offer the garrison a final chance to surrender with honor or to call a temporary truce
on the other hand when an escalade failed to make a serious dent in the defenses the attackers intensified the onslaught
they also began constructing siegeworks or a siege castle sometimes called a countercastle in preparation for a prolonged conflict
then they would man the era ’s most destructive weapons siege engines
no two sieges were ever conducted in exactly the same way
how the operation developed depended on the strength size and resources of the attacking army the condition and complexity of the castle ’s fortifications the fortress armory and supplies as well as the resolve of the besieged
an army might employ several different types of siege engines to bring down the battlements while also attempting to force surrender by other means
medieval siege engines originated in greek roman and ancient chinese warfare
archimedes was responsible for advancing siege technology which the greeks had introduced before the fourth century b.c
the renowned mathematician and engineer developed several engines as early as 213 b.c when the greeks fought the romans at the siege of syracuse
his prototypical petrariae great stone throwing engines were copied and modified by the romans and later used throughout the medieval world
the romans bequeathed two important siege engines to medieval warfare
the onager meaning wild ass consisted of a heavy timber trestle mounted midway on a horizontal timber frame and it hurled a missile in an overhead arc rather like a child flinging peas with a spoon
when fired the engine ’s rear kicked upward hence the descriptive name
the onager ’s medieval counterpart a mangonel employed a long timber arm or beam held in place by skeins of tightly twisted rope stretched between two sides of the frame
gunners would ratchet back the arm and place a large stone or incendiary device in the scoop at its end
when the firing arm was released the projectile would arc out to a range of up to five hundred yards
despite the inherent inaccuracy of this torsion powered machine which is sometimes called a catapult the mangonel could effectively break through stone walls or knock down a castle ’s battlements
mangonels were occasionally used to hurl dead carcasses over battlements in an effort to spread disease among the castle defenders
in response defenders sometimes used their own siege engines to toss back one of the besiegers if they had managed to capture one during the escalade or during a raid outside the castle or a messenger who carried unacceptable surrender terms
used in battle across europe and the holy land mangonels saw action when the vikings besieged paris in 885 at the 1191 siege of acre and at the 1203 4 siege of chteau gaillard
mangonels were also on hand in 1216 when france ’s prince louis besieged mighty dover castle on england ’s southeastern coast
despite louis greatest efforts which included a battery of siege engines he failed to breach dover ’s formidable defenses
the romans modified the modest greek siege engine known as the scorpion into a horrific dart firing machine called the ballista which was later used during the middle ages
like the mangonel the ballista was powered by twisted skeins of rope hair or sinew
but instead of firing its missiles in an overhead arc the ballista loosed heavy stones bolts and spears along a flat trajectory
easy to fire accurately smaller ballistas were effective anti personnel weapons that could skewer warriors to trees while large versions could send a sixty pound stone at least four hundred yards
a variant of the ballista was a tension driven device called the springald which closely resembled a crossbow in function
used to fire javelins or large bolts it had a vertical springboard fixed at its lower end to a timber framework
soldiers manually retracted the board which moved like a lever
when released the springboard smacked the end of the projectile propelling it toward its target
springalds also made excellent defensive weapons
at chepstow castle in wales roger bigod mounted four springalds on the corners of the great keep to hold the enemy at bay
although the springalds no longer survive the platforms on which they stood during the late thirteenth century are still visible
while their comrades busily managed the siege machines other besiegers used battering rams or bores chisellike poles to pound the main gateway and crash through the walls
rather than simply grabbing a giant log and repeatedly thrusting it at castle gates or stone walls until they broke through medieval soldiers did their ramming from inside a timber framework called a penthouse or pentise
used in warfare as early as the sixth century rams and bores were often pointed and iron tipped for added effect and were sometimes shaped not surprisingly as rams heads
the ram or bore was suspended by chains or ropes from the penthouse ceiling so that the operators sometimes scores of men could swing the beam rhythmically and pound the walls into submission
the movable penthouse consisted of a lanky timber gallery covered with a pointed roof cloaked with wet hides to prevent burning and braced with iron plates to deflect missiles dropped by the defenders overhead
the attackers used rollers levers ropes pulleys and winches to maneuver the penthouse into place at the base of the castle wall
they then removed the wheels to stabilize the structure
rams were most effective against timber defenses particularly the heavy oak doors barricading most main gates
against stone fortifications they worked best when battering corners
defenders would counter by using hook ended ropes to grab the ram and overturn the penthouse or by swinging beams on pulleys to smash the timber cat as it approached the castle
popular during the crusades battering rams were effectively employed in 1191 at acre a walled city with a formidable citadel
they became obsolete once the most powerful siege engine of all the trebuchet began to dominate european sieges
the terrible trebuchet was the mother of all stone throwing siege engines
a purely medieval invention the giant counterweight powered machine struck fear into the hearts of many garrisons
considerable question exists about the trebuchet ’s origins
peter vemming hansen director of the medieval centre in denmark argues that the first trebuchets arrived in the nordic countries by way of northern germany and may have been used by the vikings as early as a.d 873
he states that the first trebuchet arrived in denmark as early as 1134 and emphasizes that the counterweight engine was definitely a western invention that spread eastward
trebuchet may derive from the old french word trabucher which means to overturn or fall and probably described the action of the timber beam that falls over its pivot
the word made its first appearance in the account of the siege of castelnuovo bocca d’adda written by johannes codagnellus in the late twelfth century
according to the chanson de la croisadde albigeoise simon de montfort used a trabuquet against castelnaudary in 1211 destroying a tower and the hall
powered by a counterweight mechanism and able to accurately hit targets at a range of five hundred yards with missiles exceeding three hundred pounds in weight the trebuchet ’s ability to relentlessly pound a curtain wall until it broke open made the engine invaluable during a siege
engineers in seventh century china may have perfected an early form of the trebuchet the perrier a traction trebuchet operated solely by men pulling down on ropes attached to a pivoting arm
its medieval counterpart however effectively applied the principle of counterpoise and replaced manpower with a counterweight
lead weights or a massive pivoting ballast box filled with stones sand or dirt sometimes weighing as much as twenty tons was fixed to one end of the engine ’s arm which could be up to sixty feet long
the other longer end of the arm would be hauled down and a heavy stone placed in a leather pouch that was attached by two ropes to the beam ’s end
when the arm was released the force created by the falling weight propelled the long end upward and caused the missile to be flung slinglike toward a target
the same spot could be pummeled repeatedly and range and aim could be adjusted
eventually the incessant pounding breached walls killed personnel or crushed siege engines defending the castle
counterweight trebuchets probably arrived in england when prince louis of france besieged dover castle during his near successful invasion of england
in 1216 the french army first used a variety of techniques and weapons to try to breach the resistant castle walls
then the two sides signed a truce in october and louis moved most of his troops to london
after the english garrison broke the truce killed many of the french soldiers posted outside the castle and interfered with the movement of troops and supplies the prince returned to dover which he again besieged
the following may he used a trebuchet but it proved ineffective
after the defeat of the french fleet in august 1217 the prince gave up his ambitions for the english throne
despite the losses and his retreat back to france louis left an important legacy in england new technology that not only changed how sieges were conducted but also influenced the design of castle defenses
the trebuchet was also useful for flinging all sorts of projectiles over the curtain walls to create mayhem
in 1346 outside kaffa on the crimean peninsula an unknown but virulent disease savaged a besieging mongol tartar army
hoping to likewise weaken their enemies the asian warriors used a trebuchet to toss the diseased bodies of their dead comrades at the genoese army which held the major port and cathedral city
the italian soldiers then unwittingly carried the mysterious disease later known as the black death back to their homeland and it subsequently devastated europe
trebuchets also hurled incendiary devices including flaming missiles casks of burning tar and pots of greek fire a particularly nasty concoction whose ingredients included saltpeter and sulfur
the fiery substance stuck like glue to almost any surface and was nearly impossible to extinguish except with sand salt or urine water only fanned the flames
in twelfth century medieval france count geoffrey v of anjou used a siege engine to hurl a heated iron jar filled with greek fire at the castle of montreuil bellay which promptly fell after having endured a three year siege
england ’s
edward i a master of siegecraft as well as castle building was particularly fond of the trebuchet and used it and other siege engines against castles in scotland wales and france in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries
in 1304 edward i assaulted scotland ’s stirling castle using thirteen siege engines including a springald a battering ram and an enormous trebuchet named warwolf which when disassembled filled thirty wagons
according to michael prestwich who has written extensively on the reign of edward i historic documents indicate that the construction of the giant trebuchet took five master carpenters and forty nine other laborers at least three months to complete
a contemporary account of the siege states during this business the king had carpenters construct a fearful engine called the warwolf and this when it threw brought down the whole wall
even before construction could be completed the sight of the giant engine so intimidated the scots that they tried to surrender
edward declaring you do n’t deserve any grace but must surrender to my will decided to carry on with the siege and witness for himself the power of the masterful weapon
the warwolf accurately hurled missiles weighing as much as three hundred pounds and leveled a large section of the curtain wall
in 1300 edward had besieged caerlaverock castle
located in the scottish borders about three miles from dumfries the castle of the lords maxwell posed a formidable obstacle to the king ’s plans to control scotland
in a contemporary poem titled the song of caerlaverock walter of exeter a franciscan friar chronicled the entire event from the gathering of troops and materials for the siege train to the assault with siege engines
originally composed in french the work remains an invaluable record of the tactics and technology involved in conducting a castle siege
according to walter caerlaverock was so strong a castle that it feared no siege before the king came there for it would never have had to surrender provided that it was well supplied when the need arose with men engines and provisions
edward required all of england ’s noblemen who owed knights service or held property in his name to assemble at carlisle in the northwestern corner of the country
he commissioned brother robert of ulm as his master mason and a variety of specialist laborers to construct a cat battering ram belfry springalds and robinets probably trebuchets
edward also stockpiled large stones timber bolts animal hides and tools
ships hauled in supplies by sea while the siege train journeyed northward to the castle
once at their destination the english army set up camp erected tents and huts stabled the horses and foraged in the surrounding countryside for timber and other resources
then they laid siege to the scottish castle
english and breton soldiers toting small arms charged the castle walls while siege engines began their assault
despite suffering several deaths the garrison remained defiant and the siege continued for some twenty four hours
finally the siege engines breached the curtain wall
waving a white flag the scots first requested a truce to discuss terms but their spokesman was killed by an arrow and they soon surrendered
the english ended the siege by formally taking over the castle and flying the king ’s standard
the garrison had amounted to only sixty men whose fates varied from reprieve to hanging
if a castle was strong enough to withstand the pounding of siege engines and if the garrison refused to surrender the commander of the besieging army still had several options
he could employ sappers to dig tunnels underneath castle walls and towers
once the miners reached their destination they filled the tunnel sometimes called a sap with tar soaked beams branches and other flammable material that was set on fire
if things went according to plan and the flames consumed the timber props inside the tunnel would collapse as well as the tower or section of wall overhead
besiegers would then storm through the breach
undermining was not without risks and miners were sometimes killed when a tunnel collapsed too early
yet the technique was an effective tactic and resulted in the capture of formidable fortresses
in late 1215 england ’s king john besieged rochester castle which was held by a group of rebellious barons led by william d’albini
for almost seven weeks john used five siege engines to pound away at the powerful stronghold but he failed to take the castle from the well supplied and well armed defenders
the king then turned to his miners
first the sappers managed to breach the outer wall and john ’s troops rushed into the bailey
in response the rebels retreated to the protection of the great keep which was one of the strongest in the kingdom
john ’s sappers were soon undermining the southeastern corner of the huge rectangular structure and filling the tunnel with the usual flammable items
meanwhile to ensure the keep ’s demise king john ordered his justiciary hubert de burgh to send with all speed by day and night forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating
after the king had the swine killed his sappers packed the tunnel with their carcasses
the subsequent fire burned so hot that the keep ’s foundations cracked and the corner and a portion of wall fell outward
the rebels still refused to yield and retreated to the opposite side of the keep which was divided by a sturdy cross wall into two separate self sufficient areas
john then waited out the barons who finally surrendered due to fatigue and hunger
when repaired the new angle of the keep sported a more modern round turret
during the late stages of a prolonged siege attackers would often make use of one last great engine the siege tower or belfry
it was a multipurpose machine that would be rolled to the battlements of a castle so that the men secreted inside could climb onto the walls or operate weapons such as battering rams and mangonels from close range positions of relative safety
bringing a siege tower into the fray was an expensive prospect and required advance planning plenty of building materials skilled craftsmen and enough soldiers to move the engine as close to the castle as possible
sometimes disassembled belfries were transported to the siege and only assembled when absolutely necessary for it could take several weeks to put the engine together
only the wealthiest noblemen could afford to construct siege towers
the wheeled wooden tower normally stood at least three stories high
near the top a strategically placed drawbridge lowered to allow the attackers to scramble onto the battlements
some belfries rose well over ninety feet and were crowned with a mangonel or ballista
to protect the belfry from fire and the men inside from being shot animal hides soaked in mud and vinegar covered the framework
on rare occasions iron plates also offered protection
the mechanism itself might carry scores of soldiers who climbed ladders to move between levels
a belfry at the 1266 siege of kenilworth castle held two hundred archers and eleven siege engines
moving the belfry into position was no mean feat
attackers first had to ensure that the moat or ditch was filled in and the ground relatively smooth
then strong persistent men and sometimes oxen hauled the unstable heavy tower into place at the foot of a curtain wall
windy weather posed problems and the large slow moving belfry was vulnerable to fire from castle siege engines as well as archers and crossbowmen
each man assigned to a siege engine had a particular role to play
some were responsible for moving the clumsy structure into place others stood poised with containers of water to keep fires at bay
the ground level of a belfry often featured a ram which swung on ropes or chains from the ceiling
sappers might dig at the castle foundations from inside the tower
archers crossbowmen gunners and armored knights manned upper levels firing at the castle defenders while waiting to pounce upon them when the drawbridge dropped onto the curtain wall
during the 1224 siege of bedford castle henry iii employed two enormous belfries to tower over the battlements and shelter archers firing at the garrison
the castle must have been a formidable foe to precipitate such an extensive and expensive undertaking
after it was captured the king ordered the complete demolition of the fortress
given the destructive power of siege engines the devastation that mining could cause and the determination of the attacking army one would expect a breach in the castle ’s walls or the surrender of the garrison during the later stages of a siege
but as often as not the besiegers had to resort to a final tactic to force capitulation
with the attackers already in place around the castle and much of the land scorched the likelihood was poor at best that reinforcements and additional supplies would safely reach the besieged
attackers could then attempt to starve out the garrison
of course this wait them out approach could come early in a siege if the attackers believed the garrison had few resources with which to defend themselves
then a blockade might save lives on both sides of the fight while also conserving the resources available to the besiegers if they decided to push ahead with a full scale assault
sometimes garrisons held out for months during blockades and forced the besiegers to retreat when their supplies ran out or disease became a problem
occasionally a castle ’s constable might concoct shrewd displays to induce an attacking commander to abandon his plans and move on
in 1096 at pembroke castle in wales gerald de windsor ordered that the garrison ’s four remaining hogs be cut up and thrown over the curtain wall creatively convincing his welsh enemies that his stronghold was fully stocked
his actions suggested to the attackers that the castle was so filled with food that the men inside could resist a siege indefinitely
in fact the garrison was on the verge of starvation but gerald ’s plan intimidated the welsh into a speedy retreat
when a garrison finally gave in the men often symbolically signaled the besiegers of their intent to surrender
many sieges ended with the waving of a white flag or the handing over of castle keys to the leader of the attacking force
negotiations would then begin to ensure the safety of the garrison or of any important individuals remaining in the castle
for example in 1326 john felton constable of caerphilly castle in wales withstood a four month siege led by william lord zouche in the name of queen isabella
while the castle ably withstood the battering felton began negotiating a pardon for himself and hugh le despenser ii boy heir to the lordship of glamorgan
in march 1327 felton obtained amnesty and surrendered the castle and its provisions
as soon as a garrison surrendered arrangements were made for the movement of captives and the payment of ransom and the victors were expected to keep up their side of the bargain
a variety of solutions might be debated including banishment relinquishment of all personal property or the symbolic humiliation of the captives which included parading them barefoot
not surprisingly defeated leaders were often imprisoned or swiftly and brutally executed
in the thirteenth century cannons or bombards began to appear in medieval warfare
it was not until the late fourteenth century that cannons were developed to the point that they began to replace timber engines as the preferred siege machine
by 1415 when henry v besieged harfleur the king ’s favored weapon was the cannon the fire from which devastated the castle ’s barbican to the point that the english could then torch the castle and force the french garrison ’s surrender
in response to changing technology castle builders devised sturdier defenses to thwart the bombards as at craignethan castle in scotland where low thick bastion walls with cannon loops were added in 1530
as the construction of new castles waned henrician gun forts henry viii ’s so called italian device forts armed with clustered circular batteries of heavy artillery that eased cannon positioning began to take their place
despite these developments besieging armies continued to adhere to the conventions of warfare established centuries earlier
like the timber siege engines in time the castle became obsolete not just as a weapon in the medieval arsenal but also as a formidable residence
yet castles continued to serve a military function until well into the seventeenth century when they thwarted the efforts of parliament to defeat king charles i. as late as world war ii dover castle was still considered to have strategic value to the british army and was used by churchill and his compatriots in the battle against germany
while castles and trebuchets no longer play a critical role in the military theater the conventions of siege warfare still guide the efforts of military strategists around the world
