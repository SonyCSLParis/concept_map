latin petrus sabbatius iustinianus augustus was born around 482 ce in tauresium a village in illyria
his uncle emperor justin i was an imperial bodyguard who reached the throne on the death of anastasius in 518 ce justinian who reigned from 527 to 565 ce is considered one of the most important late roman and byzantine emperors
he started a significant military campaign to retake africa from the vandals in 533 to 534 ce and italy from the goths 535 to 554 ce
he also ordered the rebuilding of the hagia sophia church begun in 532 ce as well as an empire wide construction drive resulting in new churches monasteries forts water reservoirs and bridges
his other great achievement was the completion of the codex iustinianus codex of justinian between 529 and 534 ce
this was the bringing together of all the roman laws that had been issued from the time of emperor hadrian 117 138 ce to the present
he is widely held as one of the greatest and most controversial late roman byzantine emperors in history
justinian 's early life not a great deal is known about justinian 's early life
his mother vigilantia was the sister of the excubitor imperial bodyguard
justin adopted his nephew and brought him to constantinople to guarantee his education
during justin 's reign justinian acted as a close confidant and advisor he became consul in 521 ce and thereafter commander of the eastern army
in 525 ce he married theodora a woman from a poor background and possibly a courtesan
though not an active soldier himself justinian initiated an enormous military enterprise with the aim of taking italy sicily and africa
though not an active soldier himself justinian initiated an enormous military enterprise with the aim of taking italy sicily and africa
his military career began however in the east
the iberian war 526 532 ce was fought against the sassanian empire over control of the kingdom of iberia in the caucasus mountains roughly the modern state of georgia
the conflict was one theatre of a wider war against the sassanian empire going back to the time of anastasius i.
after several battles a truce was signed upon the death of the sassanian shah emperor
kavadh i and the accession of his son khosroes i.justinian the vandals
the vandals had been in control of africa 's capital carthage since 439 ce and thereafter spread their influence over africa tripolitania corsica sardinia and the balearic islands
in 533 ce justinian launched a reconquest effort aimed at claiming these areas for the byzantine empire
this began in the spring of 533 ce with an anti vandal revolt in tripolitania today 's western libya which was consolidated by roman soldiers from the empire 's province of cyrenaica
soon after general belisarius justinian 's most successful military leader led a force of soldiers in ships from the aegean stopping off at sicily and landing in africa
a series of battles followed and in the winter of 534 ce the vandal king gelimer surrendered leaving africa in roman hands after almost a century of vandal rule
the gothic war totila the goths had been in control of italy and sicily since 476 ce when the last roman emperor in the west romulus augustulus was deposed
though the gothic rex italiae king of italy odoacer recognised the authority of the emperor in constantinople the gothic regime began to initiate policies independent of the roman sphere
the roman aristocracy of italy remained in a position of privilege even after the gothic conquest but conflict and disagreement emerged in 524 ce with the execution of the leading roman italian politician boethius
in this context of discontent in the gothic regime justinian sought to retake italy and sicily
the rapid conquest of africa had encouraged the emperor and he sent belisarius with a small force to attack sicily which fell quickly to the romans in 535 ce
by 540 ce after a series of victories and defeats against the goths and their allies in italy as well as in dalmatia modern croatia italy was secured for the romans
empire of justinian ihowever this was not the end of the gothic war
though much of italy was under roman control some towns and cities such as verona remained under gothic influence
though soundly defeated the remainder of the gothic regime found a new leader in totila
in the autumn of 541 ce he was proclaimed king soon after leading a reconquest of italy
though at the head of a relatively small force totila was helped in his goals by several problems in the roman empire
around the same time new hostilities opened between justinian and the sassanian empire which meant that resources had to be split between east and west
an outbreak of plague in 542 ce later called the justinianic plague crippled the empire 's ability to respond
totila thus managed to defeat the first roman counter attacks and captured naples by siege in 543 ce
rome itself changed hands three times in quick succession ending up in 549 ce in the hands of totila
belisarius had attempted to defeat totila on several occasions prior to this but was hampered by lack of supplies and support from justinian
a new campaign was undertaken by justinian 's nephew germanus justinus but he died in 551 ce succeeded by the general narses
in 553 ce narses defeated totila and italy was once again roman
justinian 's reign lasted almost 40 years but it was not always popular
in 529 ce julianus ben sabar a messianic figure in palestine led a revolt of the samaritan people against the empire
in 532 ce constantinople was gripped by civil discontent the nika riots lasted a week resulted in the deaths of thousands of citizens and left much of the monumental centre of the city in ruins
a second samaritan revolt in 559 ce more significant and possibly involving elements of the jewish population of palestine was not quelled until after the death of justinian
the codex justinianus early on in his reign justinian commissioned a legal expert in his court tribonian to gather together numerous legal notes commentaries and laws of the roman legal system into a single text which would hold the force of law this was the codex iustinianus
in 529 ce the first edition was published followed in 534 ce by a revised second edition which unlike the first survives today
the text is divided into titles relating to specific aspects of the law and was composed in latin
it contained laws on heresy orthodoxy and paganism as well
justinian 's life by procopius justinian is unique among roman emperors in that his life was recorded in two separate sources by the same author
procopius of caesarea who was a legal secretary to general belisarius composed de bellis on the wars of justinian between 545 and 553 ce which records the successes and some failures of the military campaign the emperor launched
he also composed de aedificiis on the buildings of justinian between 550 and 557 ce a work describing in great detail the many building projects the emperor undertook during his reign
procopius also composed the anecdota translated as secret history less often as unpublished things between 550 and 562 ce that claims to reveal the reality of life in the imperial court
it details the alleged sexual activities of the empress theodora the weak determination of the emperor and the power that women held in the imperial court
considering the very negative tone of the text it is unclear if procopius intended the work to portray a satirical take on life at court or a truer account of imperial life than is portrayed in the de bellis or de aedificiis
what is almost certain is that the anecdota reveals that procopius had lost faith in the regime of justinian in contrast to the positive feelings expressed in his earlier works
justinian is credited as one of the greatest emperors in late roman and byzantine history
his achievements in the fields of art architecture legal reform and conquest are remarkable by the standards of any leader in history
the works of procopius have contributed greatly to this understanding as well as criticisms of his regime
his christian faith was evident in all the spheres of his enterprise marking a step in the transition of emperors from leaders in war and politics to leaders of faith and patronage as well
