the time of the macedonian dynasty 's rule over the byzantine empire is sometimes called the byzantine renaissance or the macedonian renaissance
a long period of military struggle for survival had recently dominated the life of the byzantine empire but the macedonians ushered in an age when art and literature once again flourished
the classical greco roman heritage of byzantium was central to the writers and artists of the period
