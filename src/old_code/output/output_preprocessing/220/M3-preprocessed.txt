protectoratefrom wikipedia the free encyclopedia for the period in british history see the protectorate
a protectorate in its inception adopted by modern international law is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state
in exchange for this the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations which may vary greatly depending on the real nature of their relationship
therefore a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state
they are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of
however a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates
rationale[edit]amical protection[edit]in amical protection the terms are often very favorable for the protectorate
the political interest of the protector is frequently moral a matter of accepted moral obligation prestige ideology internal popularity dynastic historical or ethno cultural ties etc or countering a rival or enemy power e.g. preventing the rival from obtaining or maintaining control of areas of strategic importance
this may involve a very weak protectorate surrendering control of its external relations this however may not constitute any real sacrifice as the protectorate may not have been able to have similar use of them without the protector 's strength
amical protection was frequently extended by the great powers to other christian generally european states and to smaller states that had no significant importance[ambiguous
in the post-1815 period non christian states such as china 's qing dynasty also provided amical protection towards other much weaker states
in modern times a form of amical protection can be seen as an important or defining feature of microstates
according to the definition proposed by dumienski 2014 microstates are modern protected states i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints"[1 examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as liechtenstein san marino monaco niue the cook islands or palau
colonial protection of the international law[edit]conditions regarding protection are generally much less generous for areas of colonial protection
the protectorate was often reduced to a de facto condition similar to a colony but using the pre existing native state as an agent of indirect rule
occasionally a protectorate was established by or exercised by the other form of indirect rule a chartered company which becomes a de facto state in its european home state but geographically overseas allowed to be an independent country which has its own foreign policy and generally its own armed forces
in fact protectorates were declared despite not being duly entered into by the traditional states supposedly being protected or only by a party of dubious authority in those states
colonial protectors frequently decided to reshuffle several protectorates into a new artificial unit without consulting the protectorates a logic disrespectful of the theoretical duty of a protector to help maintain its protectorates status and integrity
the berlin agreement of february 26 1885 allowed the colonial powers to establish protectorates in black africa the last region to be divided among them by diplomatic notification even without actual possession on the ground
a similar case is the formal use of such terms as colony and protectorate for an amalgamation convenient only for the colonizer or protector of adjacent territories over which it held de facto sway by protective or raw colonial logic
foreign relations[edit]in practice a protectorate often has direct foreign relations only with the protecting power so other states must deal with it by approaching the protector
similarly the protectorate rarely takes military action on its own but relies on the protector for its defence
this is distinct from annexation in that the protector has no formal power to control the internal affairs of the protectorate
protectorates differ from league of nations mandates and their successors united nations trust territories whose administration is supervised in varying degrees by the international community
a protectorate formally enters into the protection through a bilateral agreement with the protector while international mandates are stewarded by the world community representing body with or without a de facto administering power
belgian[edit]see also ruanda urundiduring the east african campaign of world war i the north west part of german east africa ruanda urundi was invaded by belgian and congolese troops in 1916 and was still occupied by them at the end of the war in 1918
as part of the treaty of versailles the major part of german east africa was handed over to british control but ruanda urundi twice the size of belgium but only about 2 of the size of the congo was confirmed as a belgian protectorate by a league of nations mandate in 1924 later renewed as a united nations trust territory
the territory was granted independence in 1962 as the separate countries of rwanda and burundi bringing the belgian colonial empire to an end
british protectorates[edit]a protectorate is a territory which is not formally annexed but in which by treaty grant or other lawful means the crown has ultimate power and jurisdiction
2]a protectorate differs from a protected state
a protected state is a territory under a ruler which enjoys her britannic majesty 's protection over whose foreign affairs she exercises control but in respect of whose internal affairs she does not exercise jurisdiction
2]some british colonies were ruled directly by the colonial office in london while others were ruled indirectly through local rulers who are supervised behind the scenes by british advisors
in 1890 zanzibar became a protectorate not a colony of britain
prime minister salisbury explained his position as follows the condition of a protected dependency is more acceptable to the half civilised races and more suitable for them than direct dominion
it is cheaper simpler less wounding to their self esteem gives them more career as public officials and spares of unnecessary contact with white men
3]the princely states of india were ruled indirectly
4 so too was much of the west african holdings
5]when king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 he established the framework for the negotiation of treaties with the aboriginal inhabitants of large sections of north america and legally defined an area of the north american interior as a vast indian reserve
king george reserved the western lands to the several nations or tribes of indians that were under his protection as their exclusive hunting grounds
 as sovereign of this territory however the king claimed ultimate dominion over the entire region
these nations or tribes would be considered protectorates by treaty
the treaty making procedures that evolved in the crown colony of upper canadawere later exported to the territories purchased in 1870 by the new dominion from the hudson 's bay company
a basis of land tenure was established throughout most of the prairie provinces and northern ontario where seven numbered treaties were negotiated in the 1870s on the principles outlined in the royal proclamation of 1763
in other large areas of the country where the treaty making provisions of the royal proclamation have never been implemented aboriginal land rights are legally enforceable
6]when the british took over cephalonia in 1809 they proclaimed we present ourselves to you inhabitants of cephalonia not as invaders with views of conquest but as allies who hold forth to you the advantages of british protection
 when the british continued to occupy the ionian islands after the napoleonic wars they did not formally annex the islands but described them as a protectorate
the islands were constituted by the treaty of paris in 1815 as the independent united states of the ionian islands under british protection
similarly malta was a british protectorate between the capitulation of the french in 1800 and the treaty of paris of 1814
other british protectorates followed
in the pacific ocean the sixteen islands of the gilberts now kiribati were declared a british protectorate by captain davis r.n. of hms royalist between 27 may and 17 june 1892
the royalist also visited each of the ellice islands and captain davis was requested by islanders to raise the british flag but he did not have instructions to declare the ellice islands as a protectorate
7 the nine islands of the ellice group now tuvalu were declared a british protectorate by captain gibson r.n. of hms curacoa between 9 and 16 october of the same year
8 britain defined its area of interest in the solomon islands in june 1893 when captain gibson r.n. of hms curacoa declared the southern solomon islands as a british protectorate with the proclamation of the british solomon islands protectorate
9]in 1894 prime minister william ewart gladstone 's government officially announced that uganda was to become a british protectorate where muslim and christian strife had attracted international attention
the british administration installed carefully selected local kings under a program of indirect rule through the local oligarchy creating a network of british controlled civil service
most british protectorates were overseen by a commissioner or a high commissioner rather than a governor
british law makes a distinction between a protectorate and a protected state
constitutionally the two are of similar status where britain provides controlled defence and external relations
however a protectorate has an internal government established while a protected state establishes a form of local internal self government based on the already existing one
persons connected with former british protectorates protected states mandated or trust territories may remain british protected persons if they did not acquire the nationality of the country at independence
the last british protectorate proper was solomon islands which gained independence in 1978 the last british protected state was brunei which gained full independence in 1984

formal ruling structures or fictive recreations of them were largely retained as the lowest level authority figure in the french cercles with leaders appointed and removed by french officials

contemporary usage by the united states[edit]some agencies of the united states government such as the united states environmental protection agency still use the term protectorate to refer to insular areas of the united states such as guam the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands commonwealth of puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands
this was also the case with the philippines and it can be argued via the platt amendment cuba at the end of spanish colonial rule

however the agency responsible for the administration of those areas the office of insular affairs oia within the united states department of interior uses only the term insular area rather than protectorate
