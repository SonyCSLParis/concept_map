overview to fully appreciate the significance of the commonwealth britain 's global position it is important to understand its origins from the british empire
technically there have been three empires the first in france lost by 1558 the second in north america which became the united states of america after 1776 and the third was global which became the modern commonwealth of nations after 1949
each one being larger than the one before
that 's something of a distillation of the britannic heritage of the commonwealth
it is striking that when one looks around the world at the most successful countries many of them have british colonial roots canada united states australia india singapore hong kong the various peaceable caribbean islands
given the diversity of cultures histories and languages it is the commonwealth values of peace order and good government that have set those disparate nations on the path to success
quote from father raymond j. de souza national post 27 october 2011
the origins of the british empire can be seen as going back to the middle ages with the beginning of the conquest of ireland 1172 and conquest of much of france during the hundred years war
however the modern british empire can be considered having started in 1497 with john cabot 's claim to newfoundland
the british empire was the largest empire in history
at it 's zenith it held sway over a population of nearly 500 million people roughly a quarter of the world 's population and covered about 14.3 million square miles 17.4 million including antarctic claims almost a third of the world 's total land area
during the mid-19th century britain was the sole developed hyper power enjoying unparalleled prosperity
britain was the work shop of the world and even by 1870 she still was producing well over 30 of the global industrial output no other nation coming even close to her production superiority
in 1885 america and germany can be considered as having become industrialised but britain was still the world 's most developed nation until around 1913 when she was surpassed by america
due to the supremacy of the royal navy britain truly did rule the waves for centuries
with territories scattered across every continent and ocean and in every time zone the empire under palm and pine was accurately described as the empire on which the sun never sets
 the empire facilitated the spread of british technology commerce language and government around much of the globe through pax britannica and british imperial hegemony
the contributions the british empire made to the world the technology philosophy literature medicine investment institutions and plain advancements of mankind have left a profound legacy
the british empire consisted of various territories all over the world conquered or colonized by britain from about 1600
it was expanded by commerce trade colonisation and sometimes conquest
over all the empire was built on commerce not conquest
there were colonies conquered but they were done for a reason
for instance france hired the mughal empire to fight britain
britain then fought back and conquered the mughal empire which made up the northwest corner of present day india
the 19th century saw the largest expansion of the empire as the british took many former french possessions in the west indies and began to settle in large numbers in australia in the early part of the century and later competed fiercely with other european powers for territory in africa
at the same time there was serious expansion in asia notably the acquisition of singapore 1824 hong kong 1841 and burma 1886 and the south pacific particularly the settlement of new zealand 1840
the final big expansion of the empire was following world war i when former german and turkish territories were mandated to britain and the dominions
the only serious loss of territory was the loss of the 13 american colonies in the american revolution of 1776 1783 which became the united states of america
the british empire was at its largest territorial expansion after the first world war after 1918 until the 1940 ’s consisting of over 25 of the world 's population and 30 of its area
since 1949 the british empire was replaced by the commonwealth of nations
most colonies are now independent today ’s
commonwealth is composed of former and remaining territories of the british empire and a few non former british empire countries which once belonged to other powers such as portugal france and belgium
the commonwealth is a loose voluntary organisation dedicated to preserving human rights and democracy and is held together by a desire for membership and the english language as well as history
maps of the british empire on this site also show the rest of the world and all other empires
this is to illustrate a comparison of the british empire with the rest of the world and to show that many territories changed hands and were added to the british empire by being conquered from other empires or were lost to other empires
it also shows what territories were before they became british
the development of other empires can be compared to the the growth of the british empire

it comprised more than a quarter of the land area of the globe about 13,355,000 square miles 34,590,000 square km of territory
unlike most of the great em­pires of the past the british empire was made up of many widely separated countries and territories varying in size from canada with her vast area of over 3,600,000 square miles 9,324,000 square km to gibraltar two square miles 5 square km in extent
british lands were found in every continent
british islands dotted every ocean
the empire extended from farthest north to farthest south from farthest east to farth­est west girdling the globe with lands over which flew the union jack
within the empire was found every kind of scenery from the snow capped summits of the rockies and the himalayas to the sun scorched plains of australia
there was every variety of climate from the hot humid air of the guinea coast to the clear atmosphere and biting cold of the polar isles
every type of plant grew some­where on british soil from the lowly moss and lichen of the tundra to the stately teak of burma
every kind of useful animal was found somewhere within its borders from the dog of the inuit to the camel of the arabs
under the union jack lived members of all the races of the world
all told the inhabitants of the british empire numbered 500,000,000 more than a quarter of all the people in the world at that time

the empire and the sea the british empire was largely a maritime empire
for the most part it was won by hardy british sailors who pushed their way into the uttermost corners of the world and brought country after country under the sway of britain
it was held largely by the power of the british royal navy which had long controlled the sea ways of the world
by far the greater part of its enormous commerce was carried in british merchant vessels which linked port to port and country to country enabling the wheat of canada the wool of australia the tea of ceylon sri lanka and the apples of new zealand to reach the markets of the united kingdom
without the free use of the sea the empire could not live
so it was that although railways and other land communications played a great part they were secondary in importance to the sea communications of the empire
the merchant fleet of britain herself was the largest and most efficient in the world while that belonging to the great colonies was far from small
these ships were the most important material bond uniting the far flung dominions of the king emperor
to enable both the navy and the mer­chant fleet to accomplish their tasks brit­ain had secured coaling stations all over the world
as a vessel could not steam much more than 3,000 miles 4,800 km without replenishing her bunkers there had to be coaling sta­tions at intervals of 3,000 miles 4,800 km or so along the great ocean trade routes
the empire possessed the most complete system of such stations in the world
a british ship was sure of finding a supply of coal at almost any of the principal ports of the british isles canada australia new zealand brit­ish africa or india
in addition there were facilities for coaling vessels at st. helena ascension or the falkland islands in the south atlantic at jamaica or bermu­da in the north atlantic at gibraltar malta and port said in the mediterranean at aden on the gulf of aden at colombo in ceylon sri lanka at singapore and at labuan in the china sea at hong kong on the chinese coast at chagos seychelles or mauritius in the indian ocean at thursday island and suva fiji in the south pacific nor did these exhaust the list
many coaling stations were small and apparently insignificant islands but they played no small part in the life of the empire
the most important coaling sta­tions were fortified and garrisoned to protect them from attack
at many of them dock­yards had been built so that ships may be repaired in time of need
the countries of the empire were also kept in close communication by submarine cables
there were in the whole world about 300,000 miles 480,000 km of submarine cables
of these almost a half 140,000 miles 225,000 km were british property
by this immense and far reaching cable system the govern­ments of various parts of the empire were in constant touch with one another commer­cial transactions were greatly facilitated and in time of war valuable information was quickly sent to its proper destination
the protection of the cable system was one of the duties of the imperial royal navy
nothing brought home the great extent of the empire more forcibly than to trace the all british cable route around the world
leaving the british isles it crossed the at­lantic coming ashore at trinity bay new­foundland
from there it was carried over­land across newfoundland thence by sea again to sydney cape breton island and from there to halifax which had direct communication with vancouver upon the pacific coast
from vancouver island a cable ran by way of fanning island fiji and norfolk island to auckland in new zealand and to brisbane in australia
the latter city had telegraphic connection with the cities of albany and perth from which a cable traversed the indian ocean by way of cocos colombo madras bombay and aden
from aden the route lay through the red sea the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean by way of suez port said malta gibraltar and london
there were several loops or extensions along the route
an important one from cocos island con­nected mauritius durban cape town st. helena ascension and sierra leone
nearly all these places and very many others were also equipped with wireless in­stallations which supplemented the cables and added materially to the speed and safety with which messages could be sent
the commerce of the empire followed certain routes all centring upon the british isles
the following were the chief 1 from the british isles across the atlantic to canada thence by either the canadian national or the canadian pacific across canada and from there across the pacific ocean to hong kong singapore and india or to new zealand the pacific islands and australia
2 from the british isles across the atlantic to the panama canal and thence to new zealand and australia
3 from the british isles to the east by way of gibraltar the mediterranean the suez canal the red sea and the indian ocean
4 from the british isles along the west coast of africa to cape town and thence across the indian ocean to india and to australia and new zealand
government the countries of the em­pire aside from the united kingdom were divided into five groups as far as government was concerned 1 the dominions 2 the indian empire 3 the crown colonies 4 the protectorates 5 the mandated territories
after acts of union between england and scotland as great britain in 1707 and between great britain and ireland in 1801 the united kingdom was a unitary state of the british isles
until 1920 it was the united kingdom of great britain and ireland with only one parliament at westminster for the whole nation which then included all of great britain and ireland
in 1920 a separate parliament was set up in northern ireland overseen by a governor though it continued to be represented at westminster also
in 1921 the southern part of ireland seceded from the united kingdom to become the irish free state a self governing dominion
in 1927 the united kingdom was restyled as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to reflect these changes
great britain continued to be governed under a single parliament at westminster while northern ireland had self government
the irish free state was renamed as eire in 1937 as it had adopted a quasi republican constitution
in 1949 it became the republic of ireland and it severed all links with the british empire
in 1972 owing to an escalating violent situation self government in northern ireland was suspended and replaced with direct rule from westminster
the united kingdom had once again become a single unitary state with only one parliament at westminster
this changed in 1999 in a response to growing nationalist aspirations as self government was restored to northern ireland and given to scotland and wales
for the first time since 1707 scotland was given a full parliament while wales and northern ireland received less powerful assemblies
however they all continued to be represented in the united kingdom parliament at westminster also
the united kingdom though officially still a unitary state is now looking more like a federation though england still does not have its own self government
the dominion of canada the common­wealth of australia the dominion of new zealand the union of south africa and the sovereign state of eire irish free state were self governing dominions under the crown
northern ireland was also self governing but it differed from its sister dominions in that it sent elected representatives to the imperial par­liament at london
in the dominions the government was modelled after that of the united kingdom the king being represented by a governor general or a governor
each had a parliament consisting of two houses
the parliament of each dominion was supreme but all owed allegiance to the king of great britain and northern ireland
newfoundland was a self governing dominion until 1933 when it reverted back to being a colony for economic reasons
malta and southern rhodesia though not having full dominion status were mostly self governing
the king ’s title throughout the empire was by the grace of god of great britain ireland and the british dominions beyond the seas king defender of the faith emperor of india
dominion status came to an end in 1948 as the dominions were restyled as commonwealth realms
by 1953 the monarch ’s title was changed to reflect this by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of her other realms and territories queen head of the commonwealth defender of the faith
distinct variations of this title were adopted in each of the overseas realms
even though the dominions were self governing fully self governing after 1931 the united kingdom parliament still had the final control over their constitutions
this ended in the union of south africa when it became a republic in 1961 and in canada australia and new zealand in the 1980 ’s
since then they have become completely independent nations
in the indian empire the king of great britain was also emperor of india
in the imperial cabinet there was an official known as the secretary of state for india who was assisted by an advis­ory council
the government was known as the british raj
while the secretary and his council had control over all matters relating to india they did not attempt unless under unusual circumstances to interfere with the actions of the indian government
the king was represented by the viceroy or governor general who was assisted by a council of state and a legislative assembly the latter almost wholly elective after 1935
the actual work of government in india was carried on by the viceroy governor general and an appointed executive council
the coun­try was divided into fifteen provinces with a governor or an administrator in each
they were assisted by a legislature largely composed of native members after 1935
in fact the form of gov­ernment after 1935 resembled in many ways that of canada
in response to the growing indian nationalist movement the endeavour after 1935 was to try to allow the natives of india the utmost freedom possible and to give them a large share in the conduct of government
the relations of the indian government to the various native states differed widely
except in matters pertaining to war and to a stand­ing army they were allowed largely to govern themselves the british government being represented in each state by a resident
the indian empire came to an end with independence on august 15 1947
in general crown colonies were those parts of the empire which did not have self government
owing to an unsuitable climate or to a large native population few europeans made permanent homes in the crown colonies however they developed and controlled the resources of them
some of the smaller crown colonies how­ever were purely naval or military posts important for the protection of the trade routes of the empire
in every crown colony was a governor representing the king
in some cases as in gibraltar and st. helena the governor had absolute powers
in others as in ceylon and the straits settlements he was assisted by a council nominated by the crown
in a third group which included most of the british west indies and malta the laws were made by a legislature wholly or partly elected by the people
by the 1930 ’s in every case except in the naval and military colonies the tendency was to give the natives an ever increasing share of power as they showed increasing ability for self government
eventually many of the crown colonies gradually became self governing as they moved towards independence
most of the crown colonies gained independence in the 1950 ’s 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s
crown colony status came to an end in 1998 when the few remaining colonies were restyled as british overseas territories e.g. bermuda the falkland islands gibraltar
in the protectorates such as somaliland bechuanaland and nyasaland in africa the natives were ruled by their own chiefs under the supervision of british officials
protecto­rates tended as they developed to become crown colonies just as crown colonies such as were formerly the states of the australian com­monwealth became self governing domin­ions
most of the remaining protectorates gained independence in the 1950 ’s 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s
the last british protectorate gained independence in 1978 british solomon islands
at the conclusion of the first world war certain territories captured from the enemy were assigned by the league of nations to the united kingdom france japan and others of the allied powers
in this way it had fallen to the united kingdom to be responsible for the govern­ment of large territories in africa as well as in asia and in the south seas
tanganyika cameroon and togoland in africa and palestine trans jordan and iraq in asia were included in these mandated territories as they were called
for the most part these new portions of the empire were governed as crown colonies
further under the league of nations mandates were given to the british dominions also
the commonwealth of australia had control of new guinea the bismarck archipelago and other islands in the south pacific the dom­inion of new zealand controlled former german samoa and other islands the union of south africa had the mandate for the govern­ment of southwest africa
in all cases of mandated territory the government had to be carried on in strict accordance with certain regulations laid down by the league of nations
in 1946 the league of nations was replaced by the united nations and league of nations mandates became united nations trust territories
they continued to be governed by the administering powers as crown colonies but under the supervision of the united nations trusteeship council
the last trust territory gained independence in 1990 southwest africa namibia
