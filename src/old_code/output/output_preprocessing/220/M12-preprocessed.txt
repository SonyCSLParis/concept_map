a recent poll conducted in the uk found that 44 percent of british people are proud of the british empire while only 21 percent of respondents regretted that it existed
the you gov poll found 43 percent of respondents felt the empire had been a good thing while 19 percent said it was bad
at its peak in 1922 the british empire governed one fifth of the world ’s population and one quarter of the world ’s land area
slave trading famine concentration camps massacres those all sound like a history that would evoke a sense of shame not pride
but this is n’t about bashing britons for being proud of their history and telling them to feel ashamed instead
it ’s about the fact that they too many of them do n’t actually know their history
the history of the empire is not widely taught in uk schools and what is taught is a watered down or varnished version of the truth
as british nigerian historian and writer david olusoga put it the empire has become reduced to the abolition of slavery the building of the indian railways and some vague talk about the rule of law british values and the spread of the english language
i do n't think people are actually proud of the british empire it would difficult to be proud in something you have no real knowledge of robert j somynne @robertjsomynne january 20 2016 calls for an overhaul last year labour leader jeremy corbyn called for an overhaul of the country ’s national history curriculum to include more teaching about the crimes of the empire
he also called for more teaching on the rise of the trade unions and socialist tradition in britain
on the subject of the british empire he said you need to get the story from the people where the empire expanded into rather than those that came there to take control of it
but corbyn is not the only one to take issue with britain ’s history curriculum
leading historians have called for an unvarnished approach to teaching about the country ’s past
ashley jackson professor of imperial and military history at king 's college london told the independent that understandably a lot of british people would like to think that the imperial past was generally okay but unfortunately if you look at the record of empire it ’s very difficult to say that overall it was a good thing andrea major an associate professor in british colonial history at the university of leeds said there was a collective amnesia about the levels of violence exploitation and racism involved in many aspects of imperialism and that better education and more open public debate was needed
the results of the you gov poll were released last month on the same day as a un report into the violence committed by the islamic state terror group in iraq which led to some uncomfortable comparisons on twitter
isis bastards
oops brits executing indians in singapore who refused to fight the ottomans 1914 pic.twitter.com/j3tr6djxig charles edward frith @charlesfrith january 20 2016 look over there
countries deal with traumatic histories and legacies in much the same way
let ’s call it the look over there approach
the bad is downplayed to near irrelevance while the good is magnified
this is a kind of natural default displayed by great powers
at the same time the crimes committed by others take on a disproportionate level of importance
a barely audible mumble of yes we made some mistakes is quickly followed up with but look at how awful insert other country is
a present day example can be found in syria
when bombs dropped by the us or uk kill civilians it is denied or passed off as a terrible mistake
no one bats much of an eyelid at the bbc or cnn
but when russian bombs kill civilians they suddenly change their tunes and it becomes must read news
look over there
look what they did
to save myself from shouts of hypocrisy let ’s be clear this happens in russian media too
imagine being in one of those buildings hit by russia
@bridget_kendall when did you ever say that when us uk or israel dropped bombs media lens @medialens february 17 2016 cameron and the empire vs. putin and stalin while former uk prime minister tony blair apologized in 2006 for britain ’s role in the early slave trade current pm david cameron has been somewhat less critical of the country ’s colonial past notably refusing to apologize for the amritsar massacre of 1919 which saw british troops open fire on crowds of indian nationalists killing nearly 400 and wounding many more
visiting amritsar in 2013 cameron argued that it would not be right to reach back into history and reasoned that it was enough that the event had already been rightly criticized at the time adding that there was still an enormous amount to be proud of in what the empire was responsible for
in some ways we could compare the results of the you gov poll to russian public opinion on stalin
there is much criticism in the west for vladimir putin ’s alleged rehabilitation of the dictator
westerners are astounded to learn that russians could have any positive feelings at all regarding the stalin era and they ’re not shy about blaming putin and labeling him a modern day reincarnation of the dictator himself
however cameron ’s comments about pride in the empire do n’t get quite the same treatment
that is for many reasons but the overriding one is simply that we in the west are allowed to be unapologetically proud of our histories
it ’s always others who should hang their heads in shame groveling for acceptance
looking in the mirror but is there really any use in comparing and contrasting britons are proud of an empire they know little about
americans still have n’t managed to build a national slavery museum
russians are still grappling with the legacy of stalin and even lenin
would n’t we all just be better off worrying more about our own histories than everyone else ’s
history is delicate
it can rarely be discussed in all good or all bad terms
its subtleties and nuances are as important to our understanding of the past as they are to informing our understanding of the present
i recently visited moscow ’s state run gulag museum
on one of the walls in the museum it was written we have yet to fully study understand and accept this history
the same can be said for modern day britain and its understanding of the empire
