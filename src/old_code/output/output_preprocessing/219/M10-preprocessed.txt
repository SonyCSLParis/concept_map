university of birmingham 's pivotal role in the invention of nuclear weapons two edgbaston based physicists changed the world with their calculations writes peter douglas osborna nuclear bomb it was 75 years ago that two birmingham based scientists published a document which set science on the path to the nuclear bomb a breakthrough which would change the world
this march marks the anniversary of the little known memorandum composed by university of birmingham physicists rudolf peierls and otto frisch who were both refugees from the nazis
the pair said in their report as a weapon the super bomb would be practically irresistible
there is no material or structure that could be expected to resist the force of the explosion
until then the idea of a super bomb was a thing of science fiction predicted by h g wells in his book the world set free but peierls and frisch began to set out how it could be achieved
far sighted birmingham professor mark oliphant offered places to the two refugees
the professor had taken over the department of physics in 1937 after serving an apprenticeship at manchester under the atom splitter ernest rutherford
now seen as a great innovator prof oliphant set about transforming the department approaching lord nuffield for funding for a cyclotron which is a machine for atom smashing as it was called in those days
with the outbreak of war science focused on immediate advances as britain struggled to stem the early nazi tide of victories and there was little attention being paid to nuclear research
but in the university of birmingham ’s physics department these two researchers were to work for another two years at benches side by side and with crucial access to the cyclotron
before fleeing to britain frisch had been working in denmark but had to move on realising he was very vulnerable there if the nazis invaded
peierls story was different
his specialism was applied mathematics a very necessary component of the calculation for both design and manufacture and he had already come to the notice of oliphant before he was actually in post
he was treated to the special affection of the british people after the war with multiple honours and being knighted in 1968 for services to science
to understand the revolutionary direction these two scientists advocated it is necessary to go back to the work of albert einstein on quantum theory and relativity
einstein ’s work gave rise to the realisation of the phenomenal energy that could be released from atomic disintegration
europe was the leading agency in developing this research but einstein saw which way the german state was headed and left it for great britain within three months of the nazis taking power
although he laid the foundations of atomic physics he was not a prophet
indeed he answered one enquiry about nuclear power i feel absolutely sure nearly sure that it will not be possible
it will be like shooting birds in the dark in a country where there are few birds
niels bohr who won the nobel prize for physics in 1921 also came to the conclusion that nuclear fission bombs were not feasible
the stumbling block for them was the tiny amount of unstable uranium 235 atoms
frisch did not accept that
with the help of some extraordinary calculations from peierls they came to the question what would happen if there was a large enough quantity of pure u235
what would happen if after a colossal industrial effort it would be possible to produce pure u235 how much would be needed to set up an uncontrollable reaction
they went back to their calculations and found staggeringly that it would not require many tons but only five kilos
then if that happened and two shaped pieces were exploded together it could be predicted that a chain reaction would take place and a temperature as hot as the core of the sun would be achieved
the peierls and frisch memorandum with their calculations was then sent post haste to the government and research was funded to see if it were possible to produce a british version before the nazis managed it
in august 1941 churchill endorsed plans to build it putting british scientists way ahead of the americans who had not yet joined the war at that point
at that stage the country ’s survival day to day was of utmost importance meaning that at that stage securing enough funding was very unlikely
however after pearl harbour the americans arrived on the international battle scene and a joint effort was possible
from that the manhattan project was born and with british help the bomb was developed in time to end the war
but we had the idea here in birmingham first
rather than spoil the next part of the story i would recommend the royal shakespeare company which is producing a play about this called oppenheimer at stratford ’s swan theatre
it is a play by tom moreton smith and takes us into the heart of the manhattan project revealing the personal cost of making history
