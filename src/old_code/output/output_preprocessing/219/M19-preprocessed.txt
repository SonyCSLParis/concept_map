it was led by the united states with the support of the united kingdom and canada
from 1942 to 1946 the project was under the direction of major general leslie groves of the us army corps of engineers
the army component of the project was designated the manhattan district manhattan gradually became the codename for the entire project
along the way the project absorbed its earlier british counterpart tube alloys
the manhattan project began modestly in 1939 but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly us$ 2 billion about $ 26 billion in 2014[1 dollars
over 90 of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissionable materials with less than 10 for development and production of the weapons
2][3]two types of atomic bomb were developed during the war
a relatively simple gun type fission weapon was made using uranium-235 an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium
since it is chemically identical to the most common isotope uranium-238 and has almost the same mass it proved difficult to separate
three methods were employed for uranium enrichment electromagnetic gaseous and thermal
most of this work was performed at oak ridge tennessee
in parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium
reactors were constructed at oak ridge and hanford washington in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium
the plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium
the gun type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a more complex implosion type nuclear weapon was developed in a concerted design and construction effort at the project 's principal research and design laboratory in los alamos new mexico
the following is a timeline of the manhattan project
it includes a number of events prior to the official formation of the manhattan project and a number of events after the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki until the manhattan project was formally replaced by the atomic energy commission in 1947
