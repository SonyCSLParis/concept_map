brougham castle cumbria brougham castle was began by robert de vieuxpont in the early 13th century
located two miles southeast of penrith the castle is strategically located between the confluence of the rivers lowther and eamont with sweeping views across the eden valley
built on the site of a former roman fort the castle initially consisted of a stone keep and a bailey surrounded by a rampart with palisade in 1264 the grandson of robert de vieuxpont also called robert was decleared a traitor and brougham castle along with the de vieuxponts family ’s other castles and estates were confiscated by the crown
the estates and castles were eventually returned to the de vieuxpont family
in 1269 the castle at brougham came into the ownership of the de clifford family through the marriage of roger de clifford to isabella de vieuxpont
on roger ’s death in 1282 the castle passed to robert de clifford 1st baron de clifford
in 1296 the anglo scottish war broke out
robert held the title of lord of the marches and was responsible for the defence of the english border against the scots
it was against this backdrop the defences at brougham castle were improved with the wooden defences being replaced in stone and a new gatehouse being added
such was the importance of robert de clifford and brougham castle as his caput edward i visited him at brougham in 1300
robert de clifford would go on to die at the battle of bannockburn in 1314 having served two kings as both warden and lord warden of the marches
in 1322 roger de clifford 2nd baron de clifford was executed for being a traitor having rebelled against the king
with this the de clifford ’s estates were confiscated by edward ii
the de cliffords estates were restored to the family in 1327 on the accession of edward iii to the throne including the castle at brougham
during the early 1380s the castle at brougham was improved with domestic buildings being added
however these had n’t been completed for very long when in 1388 the castle was captured and sacked by the scots
after this brougham castle seems to have lost its status as the main administrative centre for the de cliffords with them preferring to spend their time at skipton castle in yorkshire
by 1592 brougham castle was in a state of disrepair
the castle was in the ownership of sir george clifford 3rd earl of cumberland at this time
the earl spent most of his time in the south of england as he held the post of the queens champion during the reign of elizabeth i.during the early 17th century the castle went through a brief phase of restoration
the restoration must have been to a good standard as james i was entertained at the castle in 1617
brougham castle was inherited in 1643 by lady anne clifford who was the last member of the clifford family to live at the castle
during this period the castles in the ownership of the clifford family at appleby brougham and brough as well as other underwent a period of restoration with lady anne spending time at each in turn for several months
lady anne died in 1676 at brougham
after this the castle at brougham fell into a ruinous state having passed into the ownership of the lord of thanet who decided to concentrate his resources on maintaining nearby appleby castle
the castle passed into state ownership in the 1930s
the site is now managed by english heritage and is open to the general public
