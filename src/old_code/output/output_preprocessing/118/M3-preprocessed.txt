brougham castle cumbria brougham castle was built by robert de vieuxpont in 1214 on the site of a roman fort
the great tower largely survives though later buildings were destroyed by fire in 1521
the keep and service buildings were surrounded by a timber palisade replaced by robert clifford with a stone curtain wall c. 1300
he further strengthened the castle against attacks from the scots and it was to prove vital during the anglo scottish wars and the wars of the roses
brougham?s military usefulness diminished after medieval times and t here were periods of neglect when the owners preferred to live elsewhere
it was also once home to lady anne clifford who inherited it in 1643
today the site features an introductory exhibition including carved stones from the nearby roman fort
