brougham castle brougham castle is built next to the river eamont on the site of an old roman fort brocavum
a square keep with its entrance on the first floor and access stairs protected by a forebuilding was constructed by robert de vipont in the early 13th century
he also added a hall block now destroyed and various other service buildings all enclosed within a timber palisade
in 1268 roger clifford gained brougham through marriage
his son robert who inherited the castle in 1283 was a leading figure in edward i ’s campaigns against scotland
he made extensive changes to the castle improving both its defensive properties and standard of accommodation
he added a new gatehouse complex with an inner and outer gatehouse separated by a small courtyard new domestic buildings suitable to house and serve the garrison he needed for his battles in scotland a new stone curtain wall to replace the timber palisade and in one corner he built the tower of league which provided accommodation for important visitors
he also increased the height of the keep by one floor to provide new private chambers which included a small oratory
robert clifford was killed at the battle of bannockburn in 1314
robert ’s grandson roger added more domestic buildings in the 1380 ’s but they were hardly finished before the castle was captured and sacked by the scots in 1388
the last member of the clifford family to live at the castle was lady anne clifford who restored most of the clifford properties and spent several months staying at each in turn
she died at brougham in 1676 and the clifford castles became the property of the earl of thanet
the earl did not want all the castles and chose to concentrate on his castle at appleby selling the furnishing and fittings of his other local castles including brougham which rapidly fell into ruin
