federal research division of the library of congress 1990]historical settingthe roots of egyptian civilization go back more than 6,000 years to the beginning of settled life along the banks of the nile river
the country has an unusual geographical and cultural unity that has given the egyptian people a strong sense of identity and a pride in their heritage as descendants of humankind 's earliest civilized community
within the long sweep of egyptian history certain events or epochs have been crucial to the development of egyptian society and culture
one of these was the unification of upper egypt and lower egypt sometime in the third millennium b.c.
the ancient egyptians regarded this event as the most important in their history comparable to the first time or the creation of the universe
with the unification of the two lands by the legendary if not mythical king menes the glorious pharaonic age began
power was centralized in the hands of a god king and thus egypt became the first organized society
the ancient egyptians were the first people of antiquity to believe in life after death
they were the first to build in stone and to fashion the arch in stone and brick
even before the unification of the two lands the egyptians had developed a plow and a system of writing
they were accomplished sailors and shipbuilders
they learned to chart the heavens in order to predict the nile flood
their physicians prescribed healing remedies and performed surgical operations
they sculpted in stone and decorated the walls of their tombs with naturalistic murals in vibrant colors
the legacy of ancient egypt is written in stone across the face of the country from the pyramids of upper egypt to the rock tombs in the valley of the kings to the old kingdom temples of luxor and karnak to the ptolemaic temples of edfu and dendera and to the roman temple to isis on philae island
ancient egyptthe predynastic period and the first and second dynasties 6000 2686 b.c.during this period when people first began to settle along the banks of the nile nahr an nil and to evolve from hunters and gatherers to settled subsistence agriculturalists egypt developed the written language religion and institutions that made it the world 's first organized society
through pharaonic egypt africa claims to be the cradle of one of the earliest and most spectacular civilizations of antiquity
one of the unique features of ancient egyptian civilization was the bond between the nile and the egyptian people and their institutions
the nile caused the great productivity of the soil for it annually brought a copious deposit of rich silt from the monsoon swept tableland of ethiopia
each july the level of the nile began to rise and by the end of august the flood reached its full height
at the end of october the flood began to recede leaving behind a fairly uniform deposit of silt as well as lagoons and streams that became natural reservoirs for fish
by april the nile was at its lowest level
vegetation started to diminish seasonal pools dried out and game began to move south
then in july the nile would rise again and the cycle was repeated
because of the fall and rise of the river one can understand why the egyptians were the first people to believe in life after death
the rise and fall of the flood waters meant that the death of the land would be followed each year by the rebirth of the crops
thus rebirth was seen as a natural sequence to death
like the sun which died when it sank on the western horizon and was reborn in the eastern sky on the following morning humans would also rise and live again
sometime during the final paleolithic period and the neolithic era a revolution occurred in food production
meat ceased to be the chief article of diet and was replaced by plants such as wheat and barley grown extensively as crops and not gathered at random in the wild
the relatively egalitarian tribal structure of the nile valley broke down because of the need to manage and control the new agricultural economy and the surplus it generated
long distance trade within egypt a high degree of craft specialization and sustained contacts with southwest asia encouraged the development of towns and a hierarchical structure with power residing in a headman who was believed to be able to control the nile flood
the headman 's power rested on his reputation as a rainmaker king
 the towns became trading centers political centers and cult centers
egyptologists disagree as to when these small autonomous communities were unified into the separate kingdoms of lower egypt and upper egypt and as to when the two kingdoms were united under one king
nevertheless the most important political event in ancient egyptian history was the unification of the two lands the black land of the delta so called because of the darkness of its rich soil and the red land of upper egypt the sun baked land of the desert
the rulers of lower egypt wore the red crown and had the bee as their symbol
the leaders of upper egypt wore the white crown and took the sedge as their emblem
after the unification of the two kingdoms the pharaoh wore the double crown symbolizing the unity of the two lands
the chief god of the delta was horus and that of upper egypt was seth
the unification of the two kingdoms resulted in combining the two myths concerning the gods
horus was the son of osiris and isis and avenged the evil seth 's slaying of his father by killing seth thus showing the triumph of good over evil
horus took over his father 's throne and was regarded as the ancestor of the pharaohs
after unification each pharaoh took a horus name that indicated that he was the reincarnation of horus
according to tradition king menes of upper egypt united the two kingdoms and established his capital at memphis then known as the white walls
 some scholars believe menes was the horus king narmer whereas others prefer to regard him as a purely legendary figure
with the emergence of a strong centralized government under a god king the country 's nascent economic and political institutions became subject to royal authority
the central government either directly or through major officials became the employer of soldiers retainers bureaucrats and artisans whose goods and services benefited the upper classes and the state gods
in the course of the early dynastic period artisans and civil servants working for the central government fashioned the highly sophisticated traditions of art and learning that thereafter constituted the basic pattern of pharaonic civilization
the old kingdom middle kingdom and second intermediate period 2686 to 1552 b.c.historians have given the name kingdom to those periods in egyptian history when the central government was strong the country was unified and there was an orderly succession of pharaohs
at times however central authority broke down competing centers of power emerged and the country was plunged into civil war or was occupied by foreigners
these periods are known as intermediate periods
 the old kingdom and the middle kingdom together represent an important single phase in egyptian political and cultural development
the third dynasty reached a level of competence that marked a plateau of achievement for ancient egypt
after five centuries and following the end of the sixth dynasty ca 2181 b.c. the system faltered and a century and a half of civil war the first intermediate period ensued
the reestablishment of a powerful central government during the twelfth dynasty however re instituted the patterns of the old kingdom
thus the old kingdom and the middle kingdom may be considered together
divine kingship was the most striking feature of egypt in these periods
the political and economic system of egypt developed around the concept of a god incarnate who was believed through his magical powers to control the nile flood for the benefit of the nation
in the form of great religious complexes centered on the pyramid tombs the cult of the pharaoh the godking was given monumental expression of a grandeur unsurpassed in the ancient near east
central to the egyptian view of kingship was the concept of maat loosely translated as justice and truth but meaning more than legal fairness and factual accuracy
it referred to the ideal state of the universe and was personified as the goddess maat
the king was responsible for its appearance an obligation that acted as a constraint on the arbitrary exercise of power
the pharaoh ruled by divine decree
in the early years his sons and other close relatives acted as his principal advisers and aides
by the fourth dynasty there was a grand vizier or chief minister who was at first a prince of royal blood and headed every government department
the country was divided into nomes or districts administered by nomarchs or governors
at first the nomarchs were royal officials who moved from post to post and had no pretense to independence or local ties
the post of nomarch eventually became hereditary however and nomarchs passed their offices to their sons
hereditary offices and the possession of property turned these officials into a landed gentry
concurrently kings began rewarding their courtiers with gifts of tax exempt land
from the middle of the fifth dynasty can be traced the beginnings of a feudal state with an increase in the power of these provincial lords particularly in upper egypt
the old kingdom ended when the central administration collapsed in the late sixth dynasty
this collapse seems to have resulted at least in part from climatic conditions that caused a period of low nile waters and great famine
the kings would have been discredited by the famine because pharaonic power rested in part on the belief that the king controlled the nile flood
in the absence of central authority the hereditary landowners took control and assumed responsibility for maintaining order in their own areas
the manors of their estates turned into miniature courts and egypt splintered into a number of feudal states
this period of decentralized rule and confusion lasted from the seventh through the eleventh dynasties
the kings of the twelfth dynasty restored central government control and a single strong kingship in the period known as the middle kingdom
the middle kingdom ended with the conquest of egypt by the hyksos the so called shepherd kings
the hyksos were semitic nomads who broke into the delta from the northeast and ruled egypt from avaris in the eastern delta
pyramid building in the old and middle kingdoms with the third dynasty egypt entered into the five centuries of high culture known as the pyramid age
the age is associated with chancellor imhotep the adviser administrator and architect of pharaoh djoser
he built the pharaoh 's funerary complex including his tomb the step pyramid at saqqarah
imhotep is famed as the inventor of building in dressed stone
his architectural genius lay in his use of durable fine quality limestone to imitate the brick wood and reed structures that have since disappeared
the first true pyramid was built by snoferu the first king of the fourth dynasty
his son and successor kheops built the great pyramid at giza al jizah this with its two companions on the same site was considered one of the wonders of the ancient world
it contained well over 2 million blocks of limestone some weighing fifteen tons apiece
the casing stones of the great pyramid were stripped off to build medieval cairo al qahirah
the building and equipping of funerary monuments represented the single largest industry through the old kingdom and after a break the middle kingdom as well
the channeling of so much of the country 's resources into building and equipping funerary monuments may seem unproductive by modern standards but pyramid building seems to have been essential for the growth of pharaonic civilization
as egyptologists have pointed out in ancient societies innovations in technology arose not so much from deliberate research as from the consequences of developing lavish court projects
equally important the continued consumption of so great a quantity of wealth and of the products of artisanship sustained the machinery that produced them by creating fresh demand as reign succeeded reign
the pyramids of the pharaohs the tombs of the elite and the burial practices of the poorer classes are related to ancient egyptian religious beliefs particularly belief in the afterlife
the egyptian belief that life would continue after death in a form similar to that experienced on earth was an important element in the development of art and architecture that was not present in other cultures
thus in egypt a dwelling place was provided for the dead in the form of a pyramid or a rock tomb
life was magically recreated in pictures on the walls of the tombs and a substitute in stone was provided for the perishable body of the deceased
the new kingdom and third intermediate period 1552 664 b.c.around the year 1600 b.c. a semi autonomous theban dynasty under the suzerainty of the hyksos became determined to drive the shepherd kings out of the country and extend its own power
the country was liberated from the hyksos and unified by ahmose ruled 1570 1546 b.c. the son of the last ruler of the seventeenth dynasty
he was honored by subsequent generations as the founder of a new line the eighteenth dynasty and as the initiator of a glorious chapter in egyptian history
during the new kingdom egypt reached the peak of its power wealth and territory
the government was reorganized into a military state with an administration centralized in the hands of the pharaoh and his chief minister
through the intensive military campaigns of pharaoh thutmose iii 1490 1436 b.c. palestine syria and the northern euphrates area in mesopotamia were brought within the new kingdom
this territorial expansion involved egypt in a complicated system of diplomacy alliances and treaties
after thutmose iii established the empire succeeding pharaohs frequently engaged in warfare to defend the state against the pressures of libyans from the west nubians and ethiopians kushites from the south hittites from the east and philistines sea people from the aegean mediterranean region of the north
toward the end of the twentieth dynasty egyptian power declined at home and abroad
egypt was once more separated into its natural divisions of upper egypt and lower egypt
the pharaoh now ruled from his residence city in the north and memphis remained the hallowed capital where the pharaoh was crowned and his jubilees celebrated
upper egypt was governed from thebes
during the twenty first dynasty the pharaohs ruled from tanis san al hajar al qibliyah while a virtually autonomous theocracy controlled thebes egyptian control in nubia and ethiopia vanished
the pharaohs of the twenty second and twentythird dynasties were mostly libyans
those of the brief twentyfourth dynasty were egyptians of the nile delta and those of the twenty fifth were nubians and ethiopians
this dynasty 's ventures into palestine brought about an assyrian intervention resulting in the rejection of the ethiopians and the reestablishment by the assyrians of egyptian rulers at sais sa al hajar about eighty kilometers southeast of alexandria al iskandariyah on the rosetta branch of the nile
art and architecture in the new kingdom as historian cyril aldred has said the civilization of the new kingdom seems the most golden of all the epochs of egyptian history perhaps because so much of its wealth remains
the rich store of treasures from the tomb of tutankhamen 1347 1337 b.c. gives us a glimpse of the dazzling court art of the period and the skills of the artisans of the day
one of the innovations of the period was the construction of rock tombs for the pharaohs and the elite
around 1500 b.c. pharaoh amenophis i abandoned the pyramid in favor of a rock hewn tomb in the crags of western thebes present day luxor
his example was followed by his successors who for the next four centuries cut their tombs in the valley of the kings and built their mortuary temples on the plain below
other wadis or river valleys were subsequently used for the tombs of queens and princes
another new kingdom innovation was temple building which began with queen hatshepsut who as the heiress queen seized power in default of male claimants to the throne
she was particularly devoted to the worship of the god amun whose cult was centered at thebes
she built a splendid temple dedicated to him and to her own funerary cult at dayr al bahri in western thebes
one of the greatest temples still standing is that of pharaoh amenophis iii at thebes
with amenophis iii statuary on an enormous scale makes its appearance
the most notable is the pair of colossi the so called colossi of memnon which still dominate the theban plain before the vanished portal of his funerary temple
ramesses ii was the most vigorous builder to wear the double crown of egypt
nearly half the temples remaining in egypt date from his reign
some of his constructions include his mortuary temple at thebes popularly known as the ramesseum the huge hypostyle hall at karnak the rock hewn temple at abu simbel abu sunbul and his new capital city of pi ramesses
the cult of the sun god and akhenaten 's monotheism during the new kingdom the cult of the sun god ra became increasingly important until it evolved into the uncompromising monotheism of pharaoh akhenaten amenhotep iv 1364 1347 b.c.
according to the cult ra created himself from a primeval mound in the shape of a pyramid and then created all other gods
thus ra was not only the sun god he was also the universe having created himself from himself
ra was invoked as aten or the great disc that illuminated the world of the living and the dead
the effect of these doctrines can be seen in the sun worship of pharaoh akhenaten who became an uncompromising monotheist
aldred has speculated that monotheism was akhenaten 's own idea the result of regarding aten as a self created heavenly king whose son the pharaoh was also unique
akhenaten made aten the supreme state god symbolized as a rayed disk with each sunbeam ending in a ministering hand
other gods were abolished their images smashed their names excised their temples abandoned and their revenues impounded
the plural word for god was suppressed
sometime in the fifth or sixth year of his reign akhenaten moved his capital to a new city called akhetaten present day tall al amarinah also seen as tell al amarna
at that time the pharaoh previously known as amenhotep iv adopted the name akhenaten
his wife queen nefertiti shared his beliefs
akhenaten 's religious ideas did not survive his death
his ideas were abandoned in part because of the economic collapse that ensued at the end of his reign
to restore the morale of the nation akhenaten 's successor tutankhamen appeased the offended gods whose resentment would have blighted all human enterprise
temples were cleaned and repaired new images made priests appointed and endowments restored
akhenaten 's new city was abandoned to the desert sands
the late period 664 323 b.c. the late period includes the last periods during which ancient egypt functioned as an independent political entity
during these years egyptian culture was under pressure from major civilizations of the eastern mediterranean and the near east
the socioeconomic system however had a vigor efficiency and flexibility that ensured the success of the nation during these years of triumph and disaster
throughout the late period egypt made a largely successful effort to maintain an effectively centralized state which except for the two periods of persian occupation twenty seventh and thirty first dynasties was based on earlier indigenous models
late period egypt however displayed certain destabilizing features such as the emergence of regionally based power centers
these contributed to the revolts against the persian occupation but also to the recurrent internal crises of the twenty eighth twenty ninth and thirtieth dynasties
the twenty sixth dynasty was founded by psammethichus i who made egypt a powerful and united kingdom
this dynasty which ruled from 664 to 525 b.c. represented the last great age of pharaonic civilization
the dynasty ended when a persian invasion force under cambyses the son of cyrus the great dethroned the last pharaoh
cambyses established himself as pharaoh and appears to have made some attempts to identify his regime with the egyptian religious hierarchy
egypt became a persian province serving chiefly as a source of revenue for the far flung persian achaemenid empire
from cambyses to darius ii in the years 525 to 404 b.c. the persian emperors are counted as the twentyseventh dynasty
periodic egyptian revolts usually aided by greek military forces were unsuccessful until 404 b.c. when egypt regained an uneasy independence under the short lived native twenty eighth twenty ninth and thirtieth dynasties
independence was lost again in 343 b.c. and persian rule was oppressively reinstated and continued until 335 b.c. in what is sometimes called the thirty first dynasty or second persian occupation of egypt
