csi effect what is the csi effect definition the csi effect is a belief held primarily among law enforcement personnel and prosecutors that forensic science television dramas such as csi crime scene investigation influence american jurors to expect more forensic evidence in order to convict defendants of crimes
public perceptions of forensic science in forensic science television dramas crime scene investigators collect and analyze evidence interview suspects and solve the crime in one hour
police and prosecutors know this is unrealistic but they are concerned that the futuristic technology and speedy resolutions viewers see each week shape the public ’s expectations of crime solvers
television writers and producers do not make their characters live within the time and funding constraints placed on actual forensic scientists
professionals worry that jurors may acquit guilty defendants because forensic evidence is not presented by the prosecution at trial
since the television shows gained popularity in the early 2000 ’s juries have been on pins and needles when it comes to forensic evidence
talking about science in the courtroom used to be like talking about geometry a real jury turnoff
now that there 's this almost obsession with the tv shows you can talk to jurors about scientific evidence and just see from the looks on their faces that they find it fascinating jury consultant robert hirschhorn said in a 2004 usa today story
empirical research on the csi effect the csi effect has not been substantiated by empirical research
while some existing evidence on juror decisionmaking is consistent with the csi effect it is equally plausible that watching csi has the opposite impact on jurors and increases their tendency to convict tom tyler said in the yale law review in 2006
there are instances documented in news stories where jurors specifically request forensic evidence
even if these instances can be attributed to the csi effect they themselves to not empirically prove a widespread phenomenon
stories like these compel prosecutors to outline to juries why certain pieces of evidence do or do not exist in a case
for example jurors in a murder case may expect to hear ballistics evidence if the murder was committed using a firearm
if the bullets were damaged so that they could not be conclusively matched to the alleged murder weapeon a prosecutor will explain this rather than omitting the ballistics report from the state ’s evidence list
gregg barak young kim and donald shelton conducted research on the opinions of potential jurors in ann arbor michigan
in the summer of 2006 they set out to find whether those people who watched programs like csi demanded to see more scientific evidence before they would convict a defendant
although csi viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence than non csi viewers these expectations had little if any bearing on the respondents propensity to convict
this we believe is an important finding and seemingly very good news for our nation 's criminal justice system that is differences in expectations about evidence did not translate into important differences in the willingness to convict shelton wrote about the research for the national institute of justice in march 2008
shelton said they saw more of a tech effect where jurors are influenced by advances in technology rather than what they watch on television
as jurors see technological advances in their own lives they expect forensic science technology to keep up with or outpace consumer technology
impact on forensic science education since the rise in popularity of forensic science television dramas the number of universities offering forensic science degrees has increased as have the number of students pursuing those degrees also known as csi syndromecsi infection
