anyone who has ever built sandcastles will feel an immediate affinity with bodiam it looks like the work of a giant bucket and spade gervase jackson stops
the impressive towers and broad moat of bodiam castle are like a scene from a fantasy as you gaze at them for the very first time
at a quick glance it appears to be the very epitome of a medieval castle untilcloser inspection is given
one soon discovers that it was built at an evolutionary stage when the nobility were looking for more comfortable agreeable places to live that offered them security but alsorepresented an outward show of their wealth and rank
comparatively few of its type were built and it should be more accurately described as a courtyard castle
castles built in this period were the last truecastles to be built in england they provided security and also separate suites of rooms for the lord his domestic staff guests and garrison
when edward iii signed the treaty of bretigny in 1360 he renounced his claim to the crown of france whilst retaining aquitaine calais and other important provinces
he was unable and perhaps not too bothered about evacuating his forces from the remainder of france and these men soon banded together
this was the time of the free companies or routiers private mercenary armies who would normally be under thecontrol of the king but who now sold their services to the highest bidder
they indulged in looting and destruction on an appalling scale with many men gaining great wealth and notoriety from such expeditions
at this time in the history of the hundred years war there was a rise in the more professional soldier
the leadership in the field was being handed down to the lesser nobility and many took this opportunity to gaininfluence and great wealth
men such as bertrand du guesclin sir thomas dagworth sir robert knolles and sir hugh calveley all became commanders of the so called free companies acting sometimes with the blessingof their king and sometimes without but all the time causing havoc and destruction wherever they operated in france
it was under the command of robert knolles that the builder of bodiam castle built his reputation and wealth
sir edward dalyngrigge was something of a character in his day he belonged to an old established sussex family who came from present day dalling ridge near east grinstead but returned from france in 1377 much more wealthier and powerful
it was after he married elizabeth wardeux he came into possession ofthe manor of bodiam in 1378
this manor house was not where the present castle stands but to the north of bodiam church in the adjacent valley of the kent ditch
the site was excavated in the 60 's and 70 's and pottery finds indicated it wasin use from the late 13th century until the building of the castle
the wardeux family had acquired the manor by marriage to the de bodeham family who had held it since the conquest when it was given to hugh of eu
he gave it to his son who took the name de bodeham from the name of the saxon settlement on the site
sir edward dalyngrigge was a knight for the shire of sussex for 10 parliments between 1379 and 1388 and was without doubt one of the most powerful men in sussex at this time along with his patron the earl of arundel
england at the end of the 14th century was seriously under threat of invasion from the french the victories of crecy and poitiers were a distant memory as the french slowly clawed back her possessions
piracy was rife in the channel and in 1377 rye and winchelsea were both sacked and burned
in 1380 dalyngrigge was part of a kings commission to consider the state of the country its possessions and expenses ofthe royal household
in the same year he was also appointed to survey the town of winchelsea and consider how it may be fortified against the french
this was of great importance to dalyngrigge as his manor wasabout 14 miles upstream from winchelsea on the river rother and could easily be reached by more raiding parties
he was probably more guilty of piracy and pillage in the past than the french raiders he wascommanded to keep out
hastings was also attacked soon after and in answer to this on 21 october 1385 dalyngrigge was given licence to crenellate his house to protect the inland reaches of the rother and halt the french advances"at this time many castles and manor houses were either rebuilt of fortified such as cooling castle and scotney castle to counter any invasion
dalyngrigge combined the best features of these together with thosehe had first hand experience of in france to build bodiam
he was unlikely to have been at bodiam during the initial stages of building as he was appointed captain of the french port of brest between 1386 87 by1390 the threat of invasion had receded and sir edward was appointed to several commissions one to conclude a truce with the king of france and another to survey the castles and fortresses of calais and picardy
in the same year he was one of nine knights who put their seal to a letter to the pope deploring the excesses of the church
in 1395 he was to further improve his status when appointed by the king as keeper ofthe tower of london and governor of the city
dalyngrigge was no doubt living in his newly built castle by this time but was n't to enjoy it for long
he died in 1395 and was succeeded by his son sir john dalyngrigge
the information we have on the early life of bodiam is rather obscure and what information we do have is largely thanks to lord curzon
he brought together all the information for the first time in his book bodiam castle published in 1926 and it is thanks to his excellent research that we know what we do of the castle today
the castle was to remain in the dalyngrigge family until 1483 when it came to another famous sussex family the lewknors by marriage
sir thomas lewknor was a lancastrian and was attainted by richard iii
the kingissued a commission in 1483 to the earl of surrey and other loyal nobles authorizing them;to levy the men in the counties of kent and sussex to besiege the castle of bodyham which the rebels have seized

the castle was given up without a struggle and no damage was done to its walls
after bosworth the castle was again back in the hands of the lewknors and passed to several minor heirs of the family
at the time of the civil war it was in the hands of john hufton 2nd earl of thanet
he was a staunch royalist but in 1644 he sold it to sir nathaniel powel a parliamentarian
it does not appear to have beenactively involved in the war or dismantled by general waller in 1643 as has been suggested
there is no damage to any of the exterior walls and shows no sign of bombardment the only damage visible is in theinterior
the castle was only inhabited again during a brief period in the 18th century when a small cottage was erected inside by the postern tower
the castle suffered from the usual pilfering of stone and slowly turnedinto the ivy clad ruin the mid 18th century drawings and paintings show
a local squire from brightling john mad jack fuller rescued the castle in 1815
the castle was going to be dismantled when fuller paid £ 3000 to save it from destruction
fuller was a huge fat man who was anmp for many years in sussex
he was thrown out of parliament on several occasions for his unruly behavior and many of his follies litter the landscape around brightling
a very popular man locally he did a lotfor the poor a whole book has been written on his exploits
his grave or rather pyramid is 25 ft tall and stands in the lovely churchyard at brightling
it is said that he is buried in the centre sitting in hisfavorite chair wearing top hat and tails with a bottle of his best claret and a cooked chicken
dalyngrigge would i 'm certain have approved
the castle was sold again in 1864 by fuller 's grandson for £ 5000 to lord ashcombe who undertook many vital repairs over the next 40 years
lord curzon first saw bodiam in 1905 while warden of the cinque ports and immediately fell in love with it
it was n't until 1916 that he was able to negotiate its sale
his wife tells that after his first visit hereturned and proposed to her in the beautiful setting of winchelsea church
curzon embarked on a grand programme of research and restoration with his architect william weir and it is thanks to him that we can allenjoy this beautiful castle today
he left it in his will to the national trust who have continued his work

bodiam castle is one of the most famous and evocative in britain and is probably the most ideal for a visit with children
an excellent guidebook is available on the castle and its history along with many giftsand books for children in a well stocked shop
there is also has a very reasonable restaurant alongside although these are only open from february until the end of october
the castle and grounds can get very busy during the school holidays and summer months but a visit with entry just before 5 o'clock as they lock the gates on a summer evening is well worth it
it ensures you arelocked in with a closing time to be out at 6
a castle to yourself for an hour
winter is not so busy and a visit on a fine crisp winters day can be a very rewarding
although the exterior is in excellentcondition some may find the interior a little disappointing for these people i leave you with the words of lord curzon:"at bodiam not only does the watery cincture remain but no trace of the modern world appears to invade the ancient and solitary beauty of the scene
it could hardly surprise anyone were a train of richly clad knights falcons on their wrists and their ladies mounted on gaily caparisoned palfreys suddenly emerge from the barbican gate for the enjoyment of the chase or even the flash of spearheads and the clatter of iron shod hooves to indicate the exit of a party with more serious intent
