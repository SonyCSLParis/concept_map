1386 the french invasion of england french preparations in 1386 the french made preparations to invade england
the invasion was funded through the imposition of high taxes with some nobles taxed for up to a quarter of their wealth
much of the invasion expense was consumed in the extravagant outfitting of the fleet
artists were in short supply as french nobles competed to decorate their ships with coats of arms silken banners and gilded masts
copious amounts of food are provisioned including salted meats oats salt onions wine vinegar biscuits flour fats garlic peas beans olives barley wine and barrels of beaten egg yolks
the fleet was assembled in sluys flanders where dutch mercenaries were hired for the fighting
in his chronicle froissart reports that the french were so confident of their preparations that they considered the english already crushed with the men as good as dead and the women their slaves
english preparations the council of king richard ii prepared for the invasion by raising an army of ten thousand men at arms and thousands of archers
commissioners of array were appointed to raise militias in all the coastal counties
all the coastal garrisons are manned
lookout posts are established and additional barricades erected
ironically some of the barricades were constructed out of french wine barrels filled with sand
the english plan was to allow the french to march inland for 3 or 4 days and then destroy the french supply ships
the french would be confronted in battle when their provisions ran low
sir edward dallingridge was the commissioner of array for sussex and in respect of his servce to the king and due to the threat of french invasion richard granted sir edward a license to crenelate his manor house
in 1385 sir edward commenced work on bodiam castle
the invasion the french invasion fleet set out but bad weather dispersed the fleet
a number of french ships were driven to the english coast where they were captured
the survivors of the french fleet suffering from sea sickness and perhaps indigestion returned to sluys
another invasion could not be attempted as it was too late in the year and the weather would continue to be a key factor
