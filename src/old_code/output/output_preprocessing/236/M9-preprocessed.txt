brazilian independence since brazil had been discovered by the portuguese in the 16th century the governing of this land had largely been up to this european nation
of course other nations such as france tried to gain military and political power but had been largely unsuccessful
since 1808 king dom joão vi had been residing in brazil having made it one of the kingdoms of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and algarves
in 1815 he had made his son dom pedro the regent prince giving him the authority to govern brazil in the king ’s place in the event of his leaving or his death
in 1820 portugal experienced the constitutional revolution which was initiated by the liberal constitutionalists
this revolution led to the constituent assembly ’s meeting and deciding to create the first constitution of the kingdom and to demand the return of king dom joão vi from brazil
the assembly is also known as the cortes
on 26 april 1821 the king left brazil in the hands of his son the newly elected prince regent dom pedro and returned to portugal
the portuguese military officers that were based in brazil at this time sided with the constitutionalist movement in their homeland
general jorge avilez who led the portuguese military forced dom pedro to dismiss and banish the ministers of kingdom and finance
these men had both been loyal to dom pedro and the prince was left feeling helpless and humiliated as he was manipulated by avilez
from that moment pedro swore never to give in to military manipulation again
in september 1821 the provincial governments of brazil were put in political subordination to portugal which left pedro nothing more than the governor of rio de janeiro which was just a province
pedro was also ordered to go back to europe and any courts that his father had created in 1808 were done away with
the brazilian inhabitants had by this stage become completely outraged by the cortes actions
this resulted in the uprising of the bonificans led by bonifácio de andrade and the liberals supported by the freemasons and led by joaquim gonçalves ledo
these two groups were united only by the fact that they wanted to keep brazil united with portugal as a sovereign monarchy as the open mockery and humiliation of dom pedro continued at the hands of the cortes the prince drew further and further away from his homeland gradually shifting his loyalties to brazil
then with the encouragement of his wife princess leopoldina pedro made this announcement in the newspapers of 9 january 1822 as it is for the good of all and for the nation ’s general happiness i am ready tell the people that i will stay
pedro dismissed jorge avilez who had instigated armed riots in response to pedro ’s announcement ordering him and his soldiers back to portugal
jose bonifácio was made the minister of kingdom and foreign affairs in january 1822 and he and pedro soon became very close both personally and politically
in august 1822 pedro went to são paulo to pledge loyalty to the brazilian cause
upon his return to rio de janeiro in september he received a letter from josé bonifácio informing him that the cortes had cancelled all acts from the bonifácio cabinet and had stripped him of all the power he retained
this was the last straw for pedro
he addressed his friends and guard of honour informing them that any ties that they had once held with portugal were now broken
he instructed them to remove their blue and white armbands symbolising their ties to their mother land and said hail to the independence to freedom and to the separation of brazil
for my blood my honour my god i swear to give brazil freedom
independence or death
word of the independent brazil spread quickly and locals celebrated the stance taken by dom pedro
the official breaking of ties occurred on 22 september 1822 when pedro wrote a letter to his father joão vi
on 12 october 1822 prince pedro was acclaimed dom pedro i constitutional emperor and perpetual defender of brazil
