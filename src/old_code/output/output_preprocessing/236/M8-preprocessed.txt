yes for 81 years
from 1808 to 1822 as part of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and algarves and from 1822 to 1889 as a the independent empire of brazil
napoleon 's continental blockade created an interesting situation the portuguese court left portugal to avoid the french troops and john vi transferred the capital of the portuguese empire from lisbon to rio de janeiro
in order to do that he had to elevate brazil from the condition of colony to the status of a kingdom
and when it was safe for the king to return to europe the brazilians did not accept to lose the status of kingdom and go back to being a colony as the portuguese court intended
therefore his son had only two options declaring brazil 's independence and keeping both nations under the control of the same royal family the orleans braganza or facing a republican revolution as all the other colonies in south america were doing at the time
he was smart
anyway the branch of the orleans braganza in portugal are traditionally more devoted to the royalist cause than their cousins in brazil
it may be changing though
