convention of 1833(1 april 1833)almost before the mexican authorities had a chance to reject the resolutions adopted by the convention of 1832 a new convention was planned to meet again in san felipe on april 1 1833
the nature of this new convention was more aggressive than before
of the fifty five delegates that met in 1833 only a quarter of them had attended the earlier gathering
william h. wharton more volatile than austin was selected to preside
sam houston a new leader on the texas political horizon attended from nacogdoches
for the most part the agenda for the convention was unchanged
the key addition to the reforms proposed earlier was the drafting of a constitution to be submitted to the mexican congress
the constitution was patterned after those of the american states
austin was chosen to present the petitions to the government in mexico city
at first austin 's meetings with the mexican officials seemed to go well
but as time passed the chances for success dimmed to a point that austin was imprisoned in early 1834 without any specific charges
he would not return to texas until september of 1835 on the eve of the texas revolution
