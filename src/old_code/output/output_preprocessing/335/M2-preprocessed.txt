face detail of the alice nutter statue roughlee press release from earlier in the year but very informative
a statue of a lancashire woman accused of being a witch is to be placed in her former village to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death
alice nutter was one of the pendle witches a group of women tried for murder by witchcraft in 1612
her statue will sit in roughlee where she lived before being taken to lancaster castle for trial
parish councillor james starkie said the work would raise awareness of the true story of the witches
the statue which will be placed on blacko bar road on ground donated by a descendant of ms nutter is yet to be designed and the parish council has asked interested artists to get in touch
strict guidelines have been set about what any sculptor should consider when designing it including an insistence that the artwork needs to celebrate a resident who was unfairly treated and should represent 1612
mr starkie said the piece which must also include somewhere for people to sit was to commemorate the leaving of roughlee village by a gentlewoman
an account of the pendle witches was published at the time of their trials he said it was a chance to move on from her image as a witch
alice was slightly different
from the other women it was a case of her being in the wrong place at the wrong time he said
the pendle trials were some of the most famous witch trials in english history and records show that alice was perceived as different from the others being judged
she was wealthier than the rest and barely spoke at her trial offering no plea or defence against the accusation of murdering henry mitton by witchcraft
she was found guilty and executed at lancaster castle on 20 august 1612 for having bewitched to death by devilish practices and hellish means
the statue of alice nutter is expected to be completed by april 2012 to be installed ahead of the 400th anniversary of her execution
