Depression in infancy is uncommon, although the chance of depression in childhood will be increased if parents are very uncaring to the child (or, to a lesser extent, overly controlling and overprotective) Depression in the years up to puberty is much more common and may be linked to family difficulties, birth of a sibling, or an impact on the child's social ties such as a move to a new house or school. Your General Practitioner may refer your child to a private psychiatrist who is accredited in child and adolescent psychiatry or to a specialist child or adolescent mental health service provided through the public health system. Your General Practitioner or local Community Health Centre should be able to advise you on these.
