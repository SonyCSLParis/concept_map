Children and teens who have a parent with depression are more likely to develop depression than children with parents who are not depressed. If you are a child or teen and have these feelings, talk with your parents, an adult friend, or your doctor right away to get some help. That is why it is very important to tell your child's doctor about any family history of bipolar disorder and to watch your child closely for signs of manic behavior.
