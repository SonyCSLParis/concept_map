For the Parent PLUS loan, the credit score of the parent will be reviewed by the lender to determine the parent's loan eligibility. For alternative private loans, the lender will review the credit score of the student and the cosigner (usually a parent) to determine if the student is eligible for a loan and what interest rate will be offered. It is a score that lenders use to determine credit risk.
