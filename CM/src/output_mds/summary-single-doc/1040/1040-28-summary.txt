For example, a child may be able to compute a math problem which has just been explained to her, but if the next day she cannot remember how to solve it without having it explained again, she may have difficulty with storing information. If your child is suspected of having a Specific Learning Disability (SLD): Your child's teacher should request a psychological assessment for your child. The fact that it is called a "psychological assessment" is confusing for some parents, but be reassured that the assessment will first rule out learning disabilities before examining emotional issues your child may be dealing with.
