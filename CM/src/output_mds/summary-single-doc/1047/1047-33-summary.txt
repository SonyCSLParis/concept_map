Special Education Journals The responsibility of an educator cannot be taken too lightly, more so of those that involve students with special needs. The publication is released four times in a year with an annual reference issue of schools and programs in the US and Canada for hearing-deficient students and their teachers. This journal is available to educators, school administrators, and other professionals that deal with the education of students with learning disabilities.
