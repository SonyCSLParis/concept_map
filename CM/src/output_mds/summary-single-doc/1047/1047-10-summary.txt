The Greens support the Working Group recommendation and the most recent requirement for all state and state-integrated schools to demonstrate how they are meeting the needs of their gifted and talented learners, as they are currently required to do for students who are not achieving, who are at risk of not achieving and who have special needs. Since 1999, the government has funded a range of initiatives in gifted education, and in conjunction with the gifted education community, developed a national policy for gifted education. Schools are there to support the education that parents seek for their children.
