Schools require evidence of a child's special needs, including giftedness, in order to provide an appropriate school program. For parents of children who do not currently attend a CBE school often the services of a psychologist in private practice are required in order to determine, through assessment, whether their child meets the Alberta Education criteria to be considered a gifted learner. Students identified with gifted learning needs may seek access to a wide array of school programs within the CBE, including: Their designated CBE community or neighbourhood school CBE Alternative Programs Gifted and Talented Education Program (GATE) Your CBE Community or Neighbourhood School Many gifted learners attend their designated CBE community school where their exceptional learning needs are addressed through their Individual Program Plan (IPP).
