I think that even more of these Acts need to be passed because students need to be able to feel like they can go to school and learn just like everyone else and not feel like they will be harassed. These kids need to KNOW that help is there for them, that they SHOULD be sharing their stories to their school officials, and that something WILL be done. Some students think that bullying is not as harmful as it really is, but if they learn more about it, it may stop some students from bullying.
