After reading this blog I agree that there should be saturday school for these kids but it should also be kids who haven't done cyber bullying because it does not mean they never will do it. The school could also take responsibility of this issue by teaching the students how to use the sites and the effects cyber bullying has on the life of the individual. Parents should also know what their kids are doing on the Internet, but not all the time are parents going to be able to do that, for the fact that not all parents are capable of using the Internet or Computer.
