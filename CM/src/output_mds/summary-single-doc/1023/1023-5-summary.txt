Key findings from Parentline Plus In 89% of the callers that rang Parentline Plus regarding bullying, the perpetrator was known to the victim (2,967 out of 3,331). Whilst the focus is primarily on victims, we believe working with the families of bullies is the best preventative measure and parents and professionals must also engage with children who bully and their parents. Parentline Plus is calling for the implementation of appropriate support and interventions to enable families to work with their child and with the school to help identify, address and change behaviour.
