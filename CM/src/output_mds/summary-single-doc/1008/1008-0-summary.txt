The good news is that there's a broad range of "normal" marital conflict that does not seem to affect children negatively, especially if you show your children that you and your spouse can resolve problems in positive ways. Explaining to children that you've worked through a problem or issue can be just as helpful as allowing them to watch you do it-and has the added benefit of your being able to explain it in terms your children understand. The next time you have conflict with your spouse and your children are aware of it, take the time to explain briefly and in age-appropriate terms to your children what you did to work it out.
