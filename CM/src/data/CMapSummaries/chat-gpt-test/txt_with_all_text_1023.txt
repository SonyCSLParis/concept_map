The more this kind of behaviour is reinforced by success, the more often it occurs, and the more difficult it will be to eliminate. Reducing Bullying Behaviour There are many programs and strategies described in the research literature which have been shown to effectively reduce bullying behaviour (Olweus, 1993, Garrity et al., 1997, Craig &; Pepler, 1999). It is essential that children who have been victimized by a bullying not be re-victimized by the adults they approach for help.
The class meets with a trained professional, an educational psychologist for example, who explains that it is unusual to talk about a pupil who is not present but that the pupil and his parents are supporting this. In secondary schools older pupils may be trained to act as mentors for younger ones and provided the support for the mentor from staff is in place this can work well. Bullying is not just a school problem; it is one about which our whole society should be concerned.
AIMS OF THIS POLICY The aims of this policy are: To demonstrate that the school takes bullying seriously and that it will not be tolerated; To take measures to prevent all forms of bullying and protect those who might be bullied; To secure the active involvement of all staff, pupils and parents to combat bullying; To support everyone in the actions to identify and protect those who might be bullied; To demonstrate to all that the safety and happiness of pupils is enhanced by dealing positively with bullying. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES The specific objectives are: The school will consistently challenge the culture that accepts bullying as part of life, Form tutors and pastoral leaders within school will reinforce on a daily basis the school's ethos and expectations regarding attitude and behaviour; The school staff will work pro-actively to establish a positive approach to and encourage confident relationships between staff and pupils and among pupils so that the pupils themselves can make a positive contribution; The school staff, from the Headteacher down, will be aware of the importance of keeping the level of attention high, where bullying is concerned, making the policy work on a day-to-day basis, rather than only when serious incidents come to light; Guidance and training will be provided to raise staff awareness, before re-visiting the policy and strengthening procedures; School will continue to take full account of pupils' views via House and School Councils as well as dedicating curriculum and tutorial time to discussing relationships and matters such as bullying; The school will have sound procedures for the reporting and prompt investigation of indications or allegations of bullying, and will spend whatever time is necessary to investigate concerns when they arise, and communicate with parents in this process; All instances of bullying reported will be recorded on the CMIS record system so that all staff, but in particular the Headteacher and the designated teacher responsible for child protection, are kept fully informed so that analysis of patterns can inform both policy and practice; Follow up action to ensure that the confidence of bullying victims is restored, and hopefully to ensure that the bullying does not re-occur will be comprehensive. We will make it clear to pupils that:- The school's aims mean that any kind of harassment will not be tolerated; Pupils, parents and staff need to understand what is meant by bullying and to report incidents of it; There are systems for pupils to report bullying that minimise the risk of making things worse; All allegations of bullying are investigated and, if confirmed, they are acted upon, with clear procedures and sanctions specified and applied consistently; Records of incidents and the outcomes of investigations are used to inform review and planning by staff and governors; The means of supporting victims of bullying include the involvement of their peers; There are procedures to punish the bully but also to make sure that the behaviour is not repeated; The PHSCE curriculum includes programmes that build self-esteem, self-confidence and responsible assertiveness; The aim of in-service training is to refresh staff understanding of how to manage behaviour generally and to detect and respond to bullying, and this training covers staff new to the school.
They also want to make sure that other people know that they have - or think they have - some sort of control over how you feel and act, where you can and can't go, who you hang out with or what games you participate in. If you talk to adults at some schools, they'll tell you that they don't know about any bullying going on. If kids at school are harassing you, your principal and teachers can reach out to other adults to help you solve the problem.
The disproportionate targeting of students with disabilities shows that, in addition to schoolwide approaches, many schools include specific strategies for dealing with bullying in the IEPs of students with disabilities.

"That is not only not cool, but it's not happening," he told them. Adult committee members can formally tell the bully Scout he must do his best to live up to the Scout Oath and Law if he's to remain in the program (consult with your unit commissioner or district executive before dismissing a Scout from the troop).

Signs of Bullying Many children don't tell their parents, teachers, or anyone else that they are being bullied. Some good practices to help with dealing with a bully can include: looking for signs of bullying, just in case your child is being bullied and hasn't told you supporting your child if he tells you that he is being bullied, but don't blame or criticize him or encourage him to fight back or try to simply ignore the bully being sure to tell your child that it isn't his fault that he is being bullied listening to what your child has to say about the bully and bullying tactics reporting the bullying to school officials, including his teachers and/or the school principal not getting overly emotional about the bullying allowing school officials to contact the other child's parents and not trying to do it yourself not allowing the school to send your child to a mediation session with the bully, as most experts do not view bullying as a form of conflict, but instead as a form of victimization.
What is not bullying? This is what they do. So let's do some cold reading research: A bully is full of rage and anger (a product of hurt) and feels the need to humiliate others Something in their life is hurting them and humiliating them The bully is scared of what is hurting them, and is not strong enough to face it, so they redirect their anger/hurt to someone else Essentially, someone else is bullying your bully and the bully is doing their best to hide it and they are worrying that they are not hiding it enough Although they are acting tough, they are just one simple step away from total breakdown A bully wishes someone knew their secret so they didn't have to hold it inside all of the time Some of the potential reasons for the bully's anger: They are being sexually abused by their father, or the sexual abuse has stopped and is now directed at a younger sister or family friend, and now they are strangely jealous or hurt Their parents are getting a divorce, possibly because the father is having an affair with a younger female They have a hidden eating disorder They cannot afford the clothing they wear, and steal it from shops or from other people's clothes lines The father has disappeared and has not come home, possibly because they are having an affair The family is going through bankruptcy but is still very materialistic and acts like it is not happening The mother has cancer, possibly breast cancer or ovarian cancer The bully's older sibling has been kicked out of home for drug use The bully's father is no longer seeing him/her every two weeks and has become unreliable Whatever is happening, you can be sure that the bully is blaming him/herself, because that's what teenagers do.
A clear and detailed guide to how the bullying will be dealt with by the school/institution. Provide training and support for all staff It is essential to the operation of an effective anti-bullying policy that all staff receives adequate training to enable them to apply the policy consistently and responsibly.

Key findings from Parentline Plus In 89% of the callers that rang Parentline Plus regarding bullying, the perpetrator was known to the victim (2,967 out of 3,331). Whilst the focus is primarily on victims, we believe working with the families of bullies is the best preventative measure and parents and professionals must also engage with children who bully and their parents. Parentline Plus is calling for the implementation of appropriate support and interventions to enable families to work with their child and with the school to help identify, address and change behaviour.
What does your child want you to do about the bullying? But this is your child's experience to own and define and process, and the more you can put her in charge of that, gently guiding the conversation but not taking it over, the more you empower her to advocate for herself. Brainstorm ways to protect your child, to strengthen your child's ability to speak out and fight back, to build alliances between your child and other students, to handle the situation in a way that won't make it worse.
Approaches for Students with LD Social Skills Training. The use of counseling is supported by a meta-analysis of school-based interventions with the aim of increasing the self-concept of children and youth with LD. It underscores the need for interventions that change the classroom and school environment in order to improve peer group interactions and to support changes made by the child in his or her social functioning (Wenz-Gross & Siperstein, 1997).
If your child is a victim of bullying, try helping him with the following strategies: •      Listen carefully to your child's reports of being bullied.

The suspended student and their parents will be required to provide the Principal with a counsellor's report indicating that significant progress has been made in terms of the counselling process.

Parents who believe their children are the victim of bullying should share their concerns with school at the earliest opportunity and be prepared to work with school to keep their children safe in future. All staff involved in the teaching and/or supervision of children will take responsibility for addressing incidents which fall with the school's definition of bullying and ensure that the victim receives what support is required; the bully is informed of the unacceptability of his/her behaviour and a record is made of the incident. All children need to be aware that staff want to be informed of any incidents or concerns and that action will be taken when bullying is reported.
Yougawdabekiddinme' More often than not I end up head-shaking 'I have no response for that' with awe-struck incredulity. Rosalind explained to Annie the SEAL steps, which show you how to help your child create the space she needs quietly to consider how to stand up for herself - space for her to strategize and you to listen and facilitate. Do check the SEAL steps and the Owning Up Curriculum of which it's a part - in Amy's post, mine, or in Annie's podcast, to which I link.
If you are being bullied at work a good first step might be to enquire as to whether such a policy is in place at your workplace. At this stage the parent may also want to contact the parents of the offending child, outlining the consequences of further bullying - regrettably it is often the case that children who bully have learnt to be aggressive from their parents and a positive response may not arise from taking this step. So it is important to take care and only speak to the bully's parents if they are known to you and you feel that it might be productive.

Teaching @ Tolerance These lessons -- perfect for Bullying Awareness Week, recognizing Martin Luther King Day, or any other time -- are designed to teach kids about tolerance. The ABCs of Bullying Prevention Psychologist Dr. Ken Shore, author of Bullying Prevention: A Comprehensive Schoolwide Approach, is writing a 10-part series on bullying in schools for Education World. : Support for Victims of Bullies Education World continues its week-long exploration of bullying with a story about students in one Canadian school who decided to do something about bullying in their school.
In 2004 staff and parents identified that students who were bullied didn't have effective strategies to deal with the bullying and teachers didn't have specific resources to use in addressing the issue. To address the feedback we decided to use a program called Friendly Schools and Families which was designed by Edith Cowan University. The main indicator of success has been an increase of reporting by students and parents of bullying.
Unfortunately by the time the school or in fact parents become aware of the bullying the emotional effects on the child are already showing. It can happen in a variety of everyday situations and sometimes the bully can be an adult, sibling, stranger, so called friends or sadly even a teacher. As long as the school is aware of the problem and your child is willing to tackle the bully, then I can have great success with overcoming the emotional baggage that bullying carries for children.
Why is this so common and how can parents deal with this either as the parent of the bully or victim? Sometimes, the bullying is the result of misguided advice by parents, teachers or other significant adults who encourage the child to "fight back." As the parent of either a victim or a bully, do you need to advocate for these programs in your school.
It is appropriate to call the school if your child is involved in a conflict as either a victim or a bully. (6) "Bullying." "Bullying."
Bullies pick on the people they think don't fit in, maybe because of how they look, how they act (for example, kids who are shy and withdrawn), their race or religion, or because the bullies think their target may be gay or lesbian. Because a lot of bullying takes part in the presence of peers (the bully wants to be recognized and feel powerful, after all), enlisting the help of friends or a group is a good way to change the culture and stand up to bullies. Staying quiet (even though they don't like the bully's behavior) is a way to distance themselves from the person who is the target.
Teaching proactively with bullying means that we teach our children early and often how to be kind, how to identify bullying, and how to deal with it. As we do this we should include descriptions of all types of bullying, including verbal and cyber bullying. Cline and Fay suggest one of the most valuable things we can do for a child who is bullied is to teach her that, "teasing doesn't mean there is something wrong with him or her, but it's a problem the other child has" (302).
Retaliation against any person who reports Bullying or Retaliation, provides information during an investigation of Bullying or Retaliation, or witnesses or has reliable information about Bullying or Retaliation is also prohibited.

The Headmaster or designee will promptly notify the parents or guardians of the Target and the Aggressor about the results of the investigation and, if Bullying or Retaliation is found, what action is being taken to prevent further acts of Bullying or Retaliation.
In fact, according to the results of a 2007 study published in the Journal of Adolescent health, while students were able to suggest ways to deal with a cyber-bully if they were the victim (such as blocking the sender or simply ignoring their attack), they were less likely to be aware of how to act as helpful bystanders when witnessing cyber-bullying attacks on others. Often times, after a cyber-bullying attack, students are afraid to be seen with the victim because they fear this will cause them to be targeted too. Do not let him/her think that they are funny or cool, as this is often their motivation for attacking another student in the first place.
"Schools that have implemented Olweus's program have reported a 50-percent reduction in bullying." The target asserts their right not to be bullied, perhaps by initiating a grievance, and the bullying moves into phase two: elimination, which is achieved by dismissal...." 1-02 Concludes that "The most successful strategies to help children develop social competence are those implemented as part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to nurturing children at home, at school, and in the community."

Strategies that help are: Explain how bullying works and help your child think about why they might have been targeted (it may have something to do with the way they look, or behave) Work through strategies for dealing with the bullying behaviours when they happen Role play or rehearse the strategies with your child Check that they have skills to make and keep friends (to help them become less isolated) You may need to create opportunities for them to make new friendships Reinforce that they have been brave to tell, that the adults will also deal with the problem and that they should keep talking to you about it- so that you can all make the bullying stop What if my child is "the bully"?

Victims have also been categorized in various ways depending on their being passive or aggressive/provocative Hodges &amp; Perry, 1996; Kumpulainen et al, 1998), with aggressive or bullying victims having a history of exposure to violence at home (Smith &amp; Myron-Wilson, 1998).
