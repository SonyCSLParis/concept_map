I always knew, for as far back as I can remember, that I didn't want to hit other kids because it would hurt them. If we are to prepare our children to become adults, the adult world has punishment for misdeeds, are we depriving our children of the truth about the world if we do not demonstrate that punishment is a part of life? In the meantime, just because it is a cold, cruel world, I would not make my child sleep without blankets to get used to that.
