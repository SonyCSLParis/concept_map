I read an article on positive discipline but I'm not sure what it is or how to do it. It is based on the principle of mutual respect (an element of all successful relationships) and on the idea that all human beings--and particularly young ones--are looking for what we call "a sense of belonging and significance." Understanding her beliefs is not, by the way, excusing her behavior, and you're right: both she and your husband will probably do better if they can stop yelling.
