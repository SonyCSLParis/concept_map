Why do teens smoke? Most teens start smoking because they think it makes them look more like adults. Many teens want to defy the authority of their parents or other adults. They're usually told not to smoke, so they might feel like they're acting independent if they do it anyway. Most teens find smoking unpleasant at first. The smoke often irritates the nose and mouth and makes them nauseated and dizzy. You really have to make an effort if you want to get used to smoking. And if you do, it won't take very long to become addicted. back to top

Why do people get addicted to smoking? Tobacco smoke contains a chemical called nicotine . Nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and transported to the brain. Many smokers feel that nicotine helps them concentrate. But actually, nicotine hurts them much more than it helps them, because it is very addictive. Once you are addicted and you stop smoking, you'll get a number of unpleasant symptoms when you stop taking nicotine into your body. These symptoms include:
upset stomach
These symptoms are not fun, which makes it very hard to quit smoking. back to top
How do I stop smoking? It's not easy to stop smoking once you've started. Some people can quit "cold turkey" (stop abruptly), but most people need some help. You can ask your health professional about using a nicotine substitute while you're trying to quit. A nicotine substitute, such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch , keeps you from feeling sick from nicotine withdrawal. Once you have kicked the smoking habit, you can gradually decrease the amount of nicotine substitute without getting any symptoms at all.
If you can quit smoking, you'll notice benefits within a few days. Within 24 hours your lungs will start to repair the damage caused by smoking. Soon you'll notice that you have more stamina and can do more without getting short of breath. back to top
