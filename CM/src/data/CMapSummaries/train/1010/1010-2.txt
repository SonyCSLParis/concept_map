Homeschooling Legal Issues
The legal requirements for homeschooling vary from state to state and can change from year to year. The National Home Education Network (NHEN) has as an ongoing project to keep a listing of actual state laws for each state and territory of the United States. If you would like to read the actual state statutes or code for you state, please visit the NHEN State Legal &amp; Legislative Information page .Reading the actual code can be valuable, but often it requires interpretation. Included with each of our state &amp; legal information pages are links to interpretations provided by groups located in each state. Many state departments of education also have resources online to assist in interpreting or meeting legal requirements for homeschooling. Access to this information can be found in our State Homeschool Support &amp; Legal Information Index .
