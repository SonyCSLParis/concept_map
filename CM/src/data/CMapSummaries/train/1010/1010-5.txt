IHEN-LegalEagles E-list on YahooGroups
IHEN's Legal Eagles e-list is the online community where discussing politics is the norm; especially if the politics is about home education in Indiana.
This list is an opportunity for homeschoolers involved in custody issues to contact other homeschoolers for information about homeschooling attorneys and experts, as well as exchange ideas and information about handling custody disputes as a result of homeschooling.
As a result of numerous inquiries, AHSA was formed by Linda J. Conrad, an attorney and then the Legal/Legislative Chair of the HomeSchool Association of California, and other attorney members of HSC. Because of the national interest in this network, it is open to attorneys and experts nationwide.
AHSA is a network of attorneys and legal experts that concerned with litigation pending and threatened against homeschoolers. Its primary purpose is to exchange legal information within the profession, and to educate and support attorneys and experts involved in homeschool litigation.
A referral list of attorneys and legal experts is maintained at http://www.ahsa-usa.org. Since specific factual situations can change the legal advise given, logging on to the AHSA-USA list or the AHSA-USA Homeschooling and Custody list does not create an attorney-client relationship with AHSA-USA, any member of AHSA-USA, or any attorney responding to questions on this list, and AHSA-USA recommends that an attorney be consulted for legal advise pertaining to specific situations.
