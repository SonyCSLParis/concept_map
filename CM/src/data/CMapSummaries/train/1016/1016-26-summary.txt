Bedtime problems at this age are very difficult to deal with because it's hard for parents to tell the difference between a real need (an illness or a fear, for instance) and the child's impulse to control and hold power over the parents, which is typical of toddlers. A child who is going through a very rigid or demanding stage, of course, is much more likely to cause a fuss if you allow him or her one night in bed with you, and then try to return to the old crib routine. Parents who are with their children literally every minute of the day and night may begin to feel that they have lost all individuality, that they exist only in their role as parent.
