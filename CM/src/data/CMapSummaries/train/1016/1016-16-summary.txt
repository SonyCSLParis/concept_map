In this pilot study, we investigated the effects of an elimination diet on physical and sleep complaints in children with ADHD. The number of physical and sleep complaints was significantly decreased in the diet group compared to the control group . An elimination diet may be an effective instrument to reduce physical complaints in children with ADHD , but more research is needed to determine the effects of food on (functional) somatic symptoms in children with and without ADHD."
