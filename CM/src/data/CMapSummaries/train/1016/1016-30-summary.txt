Too Little Sleep in Preschool Years May Predict ADHD TUESDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- Preschoolers who don't get enough sleep are more likely than other children to be hyperactive and inattentive by the time they reach kindergarten, according to a new study. In conducting the study, researchers examined the sleeping patterns (based on parental accounts of bedtimes and wake times) of roughly 6,860 children, taking into account their gender, ethnicity and family income. However, inattention and hyperactivity in the preschool years was not a predictor of sleep duration in kindergarten, the researchers said.
