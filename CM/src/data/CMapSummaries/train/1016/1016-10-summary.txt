There are three types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and mixed sleep apnea, although obstructive sleep apnea, also called OSA, is by far the most common in children. However, most children with sleep apnea usually do not appear to be very sleepy during the day (which is a key symptom in adults). The only symptom of sleep apnea in some children may be that they do not grow as quickly as they should for their age.
