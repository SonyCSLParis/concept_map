You just so happen to be in luck: the BabyMo from Communic8 is a simple device for 4 to 8 year olds that allows them to keep in touch with their parents. The BabyMo isn't the first cellphone aimed at kids, but 4 year olds are somewhat younger than the audience targeted by other children's phones, like the Firefly . I've worked with kids before, and I have a number of young cousins, and even though they like to play with toy cellphones, I'm not sure I'd want to give them a real one.
