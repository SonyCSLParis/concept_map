It's perfectly normal for kids to feel nervous when they meet someone for the first time, try a new hobby or give a speech. Your kids may not see you in challenging social situations but you can recount what happened when you made a presentation at work or when you first started kick boxing class. When kids don't know what to say, they may fear they'll clam up completely or stammer when the social pressure is on.
