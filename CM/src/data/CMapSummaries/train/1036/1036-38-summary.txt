A veteran of over 70 stage productions, dozens of films and corporate videos, and hundreds of voice-overs, Ms. Parker brings experience, energy and enthusiasm to the Drama Kids curriculum and her students.Climb on board with "Ms. P" and Drama Kids of East Montgomery County and see for yourself how years of experience and the desire to help each and every student to achieve his/her personal best makes a "dramatic difference !" All children stand to gain significant advantages in confidence and in their speaking and presentation skills that a creative drama program provides. Thank you, Carolyn, so much for the wonderful job that you did with our kids!
