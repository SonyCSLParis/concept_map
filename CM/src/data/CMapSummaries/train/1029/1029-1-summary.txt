again, alex, if you think it is SO EASY to get this medication for your kids, i encourage you to go out and give it a try... this right here proves you have no idea what you are talking about. One is kids being drugged who do not have ADHD, A second one, is that long term studies show that it does not even work for ADD, Studies can be wrong, but no studies support the idea that drugs help in the long term. these drugs don't help kids with autism.
