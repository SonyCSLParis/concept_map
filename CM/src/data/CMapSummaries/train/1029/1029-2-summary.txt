Keeping Kids Drug-Free: What Parents Can Do In his book When Saying No Is Not Enough , Ken Barun lists a number of reasons that kids turn to drugs, and steps that parents can take to prevent this from happening. Children who cannot express feelings are not as likely to receive support from others, and are more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol to try to change their feelings. In his book, Saying No Is Not Enough , Robert Schwebel gives some additional examples, such as when a TV program, commercial, or movie shows alcohol or drugs or people taking them, or when your child witnesses real life situations in which other people use alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs.
