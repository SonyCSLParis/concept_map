(bitten by a dog = fear of dogs) The only way to CURE a phobia (to get rid of it completely, so that it no longer effects the person) is to release the bottled up emotions that are causing it. Because of the link between eating and being sick, the sufferer tends to be a little obsessive about what and where they will eat. Some symptoms that may appear alongside (or be caused by) social phobia or social anxiety are..... A fear of public speaking A fear of talking on the telephone A fear of writing in front of someone (even signing a cheque!)
