If on the other hand you feel that it would be dangerous to get on the plane and you would really rather not, then you do have a phobic/anxiety reaction, and I can get rid of it for you. If you go to see a psychotherapist with a phobia, one approach they might try is to encourage you to approach the thing you are afraid of in a series of stages, to de-sensitise you by allowing you to feel the fear, but then point out that you came to no harm, so you can perhaps get a bit closer to it - feel the fear again, but go past it... Actually, this CAN work... but it can also make the reaction more pronounced, so it is a bit too hit and miss for my taste. Fortunately, the conscious mind is wrong: the Subconscious can change it in the blink of an eye, but if you have not had hypnotherapy for that issue, it has never been asked to do so.
