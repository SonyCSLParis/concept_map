Yes, this may be hard to believe, but you can get rid of a phobia very quickly indeed and in over twenty years of working as a therapist I have not found an exception to the 1- 3 hour rule. If, on the other hand, they are of the minority who ask lots of questions which are designed to enable you to find your own answers you're off to a good start. And it is very effective, as long as the coach or therapist uses a huge amount of other NLP skills in applying it.
