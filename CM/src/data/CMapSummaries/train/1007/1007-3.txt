When the fear of something (be it spiders, the dark or public speaking) becomes so intense that you will do anything to avoid it, this can be said to be a phobia. We all tend to have minor fears about certain things or issues, but if these do not threaten to interfere with the way we live our lives, then we can usually cope with them.
Somebody with a strong phobia would tend to react with emotion even just thinking about the thing in question, and in this case it can make that person's life very uncomfortable.
Phobias are often picked up in childhood, sometimes from our parents, who may have been fearful of the same thing, and unknowingly have passed this fear it on to the next generation. As children, we are like sponges, and our subconscious minds are very receptive, particularly in times of high emotion, for example when we have had an accident, or been hurt by something or somebody. These feelings and emotions can then become hardwired into the subconscious mind, and thus a phobia is established.
By using a combination of hypnotherapy and NLP (Neuro- linguistic programming), it is possible to get rid of the phobia very quickly. It is so gratifying when people come to me after treatment, thrilled that their lives are so much easier and more fulfilling now they no longer have to live with this problem any more.
