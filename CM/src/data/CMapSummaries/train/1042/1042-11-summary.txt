At one school, for example, the headteacher argued that the 'market' for potential pupils was relatively steady, but noted pressures to move to the 'right' in terms of religious observance; while this might potentially attract more pupils it would also entail, from this headteacher's perspective, an unacceptable alteration to the ethos of the school. For example, in Glasgow, parents in the small Progressive community can choose to send their children to the local Jewish primary school, although the education there is based on a central Orthodox ethos, which may not always sit comfortably with those from different affiliations. Note also that a number of Jewish day schools have non-Jewish headteachers.
