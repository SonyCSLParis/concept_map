Religious Education classes (seven levels) are offered for children three years old through high school at 11:15 AM on Sunday mornings. Classes end at 12:30 PM. A Nursery/Toddler room is offered each Sunday from 8:45 AM to 12:30 PM.
Children in Kindergarten through 3 years old and up attend the first part of the 11:15 AM Sunday morning worship. Occasionally they meet in the Fellowship Hall for a Children's Worship Service during this time. Middle School and High School go directly to class at 11:15 AM.
Our Religious Education program is a cooperative. We thrive through the donated time and resources of volunteers. Parents are expected to share their talents with the larger community. We request that each family assist in our classrooms in some way. Click here to learn more.
Visitors and new families are welcome at any time during the year. We ask that parents fill out a visitor form on the first visit and register their children in our program on the third visit. Alternatively, you can fill out a registration form at any time and mail it to the church office. Click here to download a registration form.
A team of four volunteers serves as teachers in each class. The volunteers rotate the responsibility of teaching and helping in the classroom, with two adults being present each Sunday. For more about teachers, click here .
