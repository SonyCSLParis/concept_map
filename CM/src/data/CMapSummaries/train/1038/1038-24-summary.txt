It is usually best if these meetings arise out of a prior meeting, possibly at a New Girls' day at school in the previous Summer Term, rather than as some sort of a blind date, and don't try to force the issue if your child is shy - she will have plenty of opportunity to meet and make friends in her first few days at school, when there will be a shared focus of activity for all the pupils; meeting outside school can be helpful in developing relationships, but will not be helpful if everyone feels awkward. However, if you know any of the parents whose children are either at your child's new school or who are joining with your child, then do make a real effort to have a joint family get-together at least once in the summer holidays, so that your child will know some more familiar faces when she starts. Your child's new school will have vast experience in helping children settle in well, and will have programmes up and running, ready to whisk your child into action and into the heart of what is going on.
