Many of our boys and girls arrive at our Home two years behind their peers academically, and we hope that some of what we do to help our kids catch up in school might help your child, too. Ask what your child is learning in school. At Mercy Home for Boys and Girls, we believe the most important part of the school year is at the very beginning.
