Student Loans without Cosigner
About Student Loans without Cosigner Student loans are designed for college student borrowers, and meant to help students cover the cost of their college education. However, most student loans also require a cosigner to guarantee that the borrowing student will repay the loan, or that the co-signer will step in to pay the loan in case the student fails to do so. While this is understandable from the lender point of view, it can sometimes cause problems for the student borrower if you can not find a cosigner with a good credit history. Do not worry, though, because there are some student loans out there that are offered to students who do not have a cosigner. The foremost examples of student loans without cosigners are federal student loans. Federal student loans are not based on credit, but on the borrower desire to receive financial aid. In addition to these federal student loans, there are some private lenders in the market who do not require students to have a strong credit history check and cosigners when applying for student loans.

Benefits of Student Loans without Cosigner The main benefit of being able to apply for student loans without cosigner is quite apparent: you can apply for them regardless of your credit history. This means that you may receive these loans even if you have a bad or nonexistent credit history and if you are encountering difficulty in finding a reliable person with a good credit history for co-signing your loan application. Federal loans, such as the Stafford and Perkins loans, are additionally beneficial, as they have relatively low interest rates and flexible repayment periods, designed to assist students in making their repayments in the easiest possible fashion.
Disadvantages of Student Loans without Cosigner Everything has some pros and cons, and the same is true for student loans without cosigner. The borrowing limit for federal loans is not that high, so they may not be sufficient for seeing you through college and covering all your expenses. Grants and scholarships also add to your financial aid package, but even so, you may still need to turn to private loans and that too without cosigners. However, there are not that many private lenders who are willing to loan you money with a bad or no credit history and no co-signer. Moreover, a private loan without a co-signer usually has higher interest rate, which is, in the long run, more financially draining for you.
Applying for Student Loans without Cosigner Applying for federal loans such as Stafford Loan or Perkins Loan is quite simple.
