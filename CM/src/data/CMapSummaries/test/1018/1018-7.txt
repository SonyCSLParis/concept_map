Student loans can help you bridge the gap between any financial aid you may receive and the total cost of your education.
There are two main types of student loans, federal and private. Both of these types of loans provide money for students to use towards their education, but come with different options. Generally, you will find the lowest interest rates on federal loans. Private loans are meant to cover what financial aid options and personal funding cannot.

If you borrow $60,000 at 6% interest, repaying this amount of money will be somewhat difficult if you choose a career that pays around $30,000 a year. You can look up salaries online and should also look into graduate school scholarships before making any decisions.
