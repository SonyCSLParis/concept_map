Welcome to the Simon Graduate School of Business - University of Rochester Website
M.S. Program Loans
The University of Rochester administers the full range of federal and private financial-aid programs.
Federal loans are available to US citizens and permanent residents who qualify, to help cover the costs of graduate study. To apply for federal loans, students entering in September will need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). FAFSAs for the next school year are available each January 1. The University of Rochester's federal school code is 002894. In addition, please note that all students who apply for any general loan need to also submit a Graduate Online Application with the University of Rochester Financial Aid Office.
In addition, many alternative loans are available to graduate students. Full information and application materials are available from the University of Rochester Financial Aid Office website .
Loans for International Students
The Simon School has an International Student Loan Program (ISLP) that will provide partial funding toward full-time MBA and MS studies. Credit-worthy international students are eligible to apply and there is no requirement to secure a US citizen or resident as a co-signer. The annual loan limit will be based on the cost of tuition and mandatory fees, minus any other aid received as certified by the School. Please note that ISLP does not cover living expenses and therefore students will need to make arrangements for additional resources accordingly. The minimum loan is $10,000. The maximum loan amount depends on the program of study in which the student is enrolling. Students with a significant negative US credit history, such as outstanding defaulted credit, bankruptcies, tax, or other liens or foreclosures will be declined. Those borrowers with good credit or no credit reported on US credit bureaus will be approved. The loan is administered through the Agility Loan Services and more information, as well as the online application, can be found on their website: http://www.faqsloan.com .
For more details, and the application, admitted students should log in to the Admitted Student Portal under "Expenses and Financial Aid."
In addition, international students who have 3 or more years of residency in the US may qualify for a loan without a co-signer, based upon their personal US credit history. Please visit the University of Rochester financial aid website  to learn more about loan programs for business school students.
Please note that all students who apply for ISLP, or any other general loan, need to also submit a Graduate Online Application with the University of Rochester Financial Aid Office.
