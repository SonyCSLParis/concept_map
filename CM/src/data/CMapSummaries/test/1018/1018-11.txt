Hi everyone. I'm entering my second semester of my freshman year of college. I took a year off in between high school and college to work and paid my first semester in cash. I have great credit but I have only had a credit score for less than a year. Now I can't find a loan that will approve me because I have less than two years of credit history. I have no options for a cosigner. Please let me know if you know of a loan that only requires very little credit history. Thanks!
Your first step should be to file your FAFSA . Federal loans do not require a credit check (for the most part) so you will be eligible for more aid than if you applied for a private loan. Otherwise, your best bet would be to find a cosigner.
