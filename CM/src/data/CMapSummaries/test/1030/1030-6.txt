Tardiness Policy (8053) The following policy on tardiness was adopted by the Board of Education and may be found in the Policy Manual:
Training for punctuality is a joint function of the home and the school in preparation for later life in the industrial, business, or professional world.

Tardiness will therefore be handled as follows:
