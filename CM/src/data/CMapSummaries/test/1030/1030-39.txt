Once again this is a difficult area for the law to make hard and fast rules about.
It is similar to the common law position about leaving home. Judges have made rules about physical punishment of children by their parents where punishment has been so severe that it amounted to criminal assault.
South Australian Law is similar to English common law, in that it permits physical punishment when it is "reasonable". This depends on a number of factors and on the circumstances of each case, such as:
The relationship between you and the person punishing you
Your age . You must be old enough to appreciate correction and the punishment must be reasonable for a child of that age. For example, it has been held by the Court that a parent is not lawfully entitled to administer to an infant younger that 19 months any physical punishment, except a slight slap at the very most.
What you are punished with
Where you are hit . Normally blows to the face or other vulnerable parts of the body are unlawful
How hard you are hit and how many times
The lead up to you being punished
The aim of the punishment
Your age, size, health and perhaps your gender
Whether you are hurt - injuries requiring medical attention will normally suggest illegal behaviour.
Even where punishment is inflicted by a parent, the standard to be applied is in keeping with that of the community generally and not that of any ethnic group.
To sum up, your parents/guardians could be charged with an offence if you are hurt. If convicted of common assault they can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding three years where the victim is a family member [ Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 s 39(1)].
Punishment - by people other than your parents
In schools, physical punishment is usually described as "corporal punishment". In South Australia corporal punishment is not allowed in any state school. This has been a policy decision by the Department of Education and Children's Services. Similarly people working in Child Care Centres, Children's Homes, Detention Centres or those working in as Foster Parents are not allowed to hit children in their care. In independent schools (that is, private or non-government schools), each school can make its own rules about discipline. If you are enrolled at an independent school your parents will have agreed to the school's discipline policy.
The South Australian Commission for Catholic Schools does not support corporal punishment in any Catholic school, and its use is regarded as being against the values of the Bible.
If you are physically punished by a "child minder", the situation is less clear. Even if the punishment is with your parents' consent , the baby-sitter and your parents could be held responsible for any harm you suffer. Whatever your school's discipline policy, the rules of law mentioned previously still apply.
Are there countries which do not allow physical punishment of children at all?
Yes, there are. Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Austria do not allow any physical punishment of children. Norway's law allows a "light" tap only. Germany prepared legislation that prohibits "slapping" a child around the face but allows a smack on the bottom. A smack on the bottom is also allowed to alert children to dangers such as crossing a road at a dangerous time.
There are special agencies which are there to help young people and their parents work out their difficulties.
