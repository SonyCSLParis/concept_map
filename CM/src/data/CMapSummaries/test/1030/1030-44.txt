He said where students live should not determine whether they get spanked at school.
"I got my butt beat and I know what's right and wrong. And my children are going to know what's right and wrong."
- Bud Glover, parent in Bonifay, Fla.
"When I heard that this practice still exists, I was mortified," Porth said. "No child should not feel completely safe when they go to school."
But the bill failed. It never even reached a committee in the Florida legislature.
And that's just fine for parents like Bud Glover of Bonifay, Fla., a small town 15 miles from the Alabama border.
It's a place where tradition is valued and paddling is considered tradition.
"I got my butt beat and I know what's right and wrong. And my children are going to know what's right and wrong," Glover said.
Glover represents the feelings of many parents in this part of Florida who support such punishment.
"I think the problem with society is we quit paddling."
He says the state should not tell parents in his small town how to discipline their children.
But in South Florida, student Camila Cacho, a junior at Miami Beach High School is astonished that the state still allows the practice.
"That's so dumb, why would we allow people to hit students?" Cacho said. "I would feel embarrassed. That's degrading."
Students Make Paddles in Wood Shop
The instrument often used in school spankings is a wooden or fiber-glass paddle.

Holmes County High School principal Eddie Dixson with senior Cole Long. Long thinks all schools should paddle students to teach kids "discipline and respect."
There are no statewide regulations on what the paddles should look like, so each school district creates their own.
The paddle at Holmes County High School looks like really short row-boat paddle. It's about 16 inches long, 5 inches wide and a half and inch thick.
You can't buy them at a store, so Holmes County High asks woodshop students to make it.
Senior Cole Long has never made a paddle, but he's been on the receiving end of one.
He says he's been paddled for things like, "throwing papers, throwing pencils, a couple times for cussing, back-talking.
"I used to be a really wild child," he said.
A couple months ago, Long won $7,200 at a bull-riding competition in Texas. But even for a bull-rider, Long says the paddle stings-depending on who's doing the spanking.
"The assistant principal, he hurts, he hurts," Long said. "I've had it plenty of time from him and he gives it to us a little more bit more."
Long thinks all schools should paddle students because he says the spankings teach students discipline and respect. And much of the community agrees.
Paddling without Parental Consent
But every once in a while, a parent from one of these small towns will object, like Tenika Jones of Levy County.
Last year, the principal at Joyce Bullock Elementary sent home a waiver asking parents for permission to paddle students.
Jones didn't sign it. But her son, Geirrea Bostick, was paddled anyway.

Gierrea Bostick, 6, was paddled on his second week of pre-school without the consent of his mom, Tenika Jones. The paddles left welts on Gierrea's bottom and Jones has filed a notice to sue the Levy County School District.
He was five at the time. It was his second week of pre-school.
Gierrea says the principal spanked him twice for slapping another boy on the school bus. He says the principal first told him to take his jacket off.
"Then she spank me on my booty," Gierrea said.
"I cried all the way home. It was really hard."
The paddling left welts on Gierrea's bottom and his mom was outraged.
"If I would have hit my son how she hit him, I would have been in jail, I would have been on the news, I would have been messed up trying to get my children back," Jones said. "She whipped him up and to me that's child abuse."
Jones has filed a notice to sue the Levy County School District for paddling her son without her permission.
But Robert Rush, a civil right attorney in Gainesville says state law does not require schools to get parental consent.
"If the school board and the principal specifically authorize corporal punishment, it can be administered lawfully against the parents wishes," Rush said.
Rush says the school principal sets the policy for paddling. And if the school acts in accordance with that policy, then "it's very hard to sue them," he said.
"They're immune both civilly and criminally by law."
But Rush says attorneys could argue excessive force was used.
The school's principal, Jamie Handlin, and the school district would not comment because they're in pre-litigation.
New Jersey was the first state to ban school corporal punishment in 1867.

The paddle at Madison County Central elementary and middle school hangs on the door of the principal's office, though he does not administer the punishment himself. The fiber-glass paddle was made by a member of the community.
The next state, Massachusetts, didn't follow until more than 100 years later, when child protection laws started popping up and paddling students starting falling out of fashion.
New Mexico is the most recent state to ban paddling just last year.
Deborah Sendek, a clinical child psychologist with the Center for Effective Discipline, says many studies on school corporal punishment show paddling does not deter students from misbehaving.
"What we tend to see is the students who are paddled are paddled repeatedly throughout the course of the academic year and the following year and the following year," Sendek said. "That's one of the things that tells us it's not effective."
And Sendek says paddling can have negative short and long term physical and psychological consequences.
"The rule in school may be that we only hit for certain things and we only hit with a paddle," Sendek said. "But if we have a culture where we believe its okay to hit, then it can be generalized."
But supporters of school corporal punishment argue that paddling keeps kids in school, because the alternative for students with bad behavior would be suspension.
Willie Williams, principal at Madison County Central elementary and middle school, agrees.
The only problem is he can't bring himself to administer the punishment. And when others do it, he says he can't watch.
"I'm a softy really at heart," Williams said. "I actually have to walk out."
As principal, Williams could ban the practice at his school. And Williams said he would, "if I believed in that. But I am a part of the community."
And Williams says this community supports school corporal punishment. And in rural Florida that's not likely to change anytime it soon.

When you have to use physical force to teach a student what you expect from them, you have taught them that physical force is a valid option in getting others to do what you expect them to do. Take that lesson into the school yard, into the classroom, and at home, and you have made a huge mistake. If anyone has to resort to physical force - teacher, administrator, parent - they have lost, the child has won by showing your limited range of capability. It is definitely not something a school should be doing; if parents want their kids paddled, let them do it themselves at home.
My goodness, what is wrong with these people that are glorifying hitting children. These are professionals...at least think they are, and they should KNOW BETTER!! Shame on Florida and the florida lawmakers for failing to protect children from abuse
