Resources: How To Protect Our Children Online
This morning I delivered a seminar at St Mark's Pennant Hills on the topic 'How to protect our children online'. Thanks for having me!
Below are a list of resources I collected as I researched for the seminar, that I share with you now for further reading. If you've discovered other useful resources, let us know in the comments section below. I will continue to add to this resource as I become aware of other material.
If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email - steve@communicatejesus.com.
At the seminar this morning I also met a lady who works with Collective Shout . It is:
"a new grassroots campaigns movement mobilising and equipping individuals and groups to target corporations, advertisers, marketers and media which objectify women and sexualise girls to sell products and services.
Collective Shout will name, shame and expose corporations, advertisers, marketers and media engaging in practices which are offensive and harmful especially to women and girls, but also to men and boys."
I am convinced that pornography is one of the most destructive scourges of our age. More and more, research is revealing the addictive impact of pornography on the brain. Here are a couple of articles on this topic:
If you, or a friend or a child are struggling with porn addiction, I have a Christian friend and counsellor who specialises in this area. Send me an email (steve@communicatejesus.com) if you'd like more information.
Awesome job this morning Steve. It was good meeting you too! It is so good meeting others who stand up for our children!
It would be great if some of your followers had a look at Collective Shout. If they sign up for Collective Shout and then join the community groups (such as Collective Shout Sydney), they can keep up with what is happening in their area and we will help them with what to do if they see something offensive to families and children in their city!
Keep up your great work! Collett (Life Smart Solutions &amp; Collective Shout)

Thanks for this, I plan to pass on the link to our congregation members.
Of all the articles/links listed above, what would you say were your 2-3 top reads/resources for parents?
Steven Kryger
Hi Sandy, there's lots there for different audiences and purposes, but I think parents should check out:
a) Covenant Eyes . It's a great filter/accountability check, and highly recommended for families. b) Think U Know . The UK version is more comprehensive, and has useful resources for parents, plus links for different aged kids. c) Be Web Aware . Similarly, this site has some good intro information for parents, which I think for most, will be a good start for getting their heads around some of the latest applications of the internet!
