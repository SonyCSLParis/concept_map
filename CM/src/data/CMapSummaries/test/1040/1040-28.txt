Specific Learning Disabilities and Your Child
It has been estimated that approximately 5 percent of school-aged children have a specific learning disability (SLD). "Specific Learning Disability" is one of the thirteen recognized areas of disability which qualifies for Special Education, according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA).
What is a Specific Learning Disability (SLD)?
A child having an SLD typically has average intelligence, but has difficulty with processing information in a particular area, such as receiving, storing, sorting, classifying, expressing, and retrieving information. For example, a child may be able to compute a math problem which has just been explained to her, but if the next day she cannot remember how to solve it without having it explained again, she may have difficulty with storing information. It is very difficult to diagnose an SLD prior to the third grade. This is because some learning problems can be attributed to a child's young age and immaturity, rather than a disability.
What causes a child to have an SLD?
There are many possible answers. Some SLDs are genetically inherited, others may occur due to problems which happened during pregnancy or childbirth, environmental conditions, or toxins. Often we just don't know why some children have them.
Here is a list of recognized SLDs:
Dyscalculia - Difficulty with math. The child may have trouble with understanding word problems, memorizing multiplication rules, numerical placement confusion, etc.
Dysgraphia - Trouble with written expression. The child's handwriting may be illegible and contain improper spacing, letters may be formed improperly, and spelling may contain numerous errors.
Dyslexia - Difficulty with reading and spelling. This might include confusion in spatial orientation, letter reversal or transposing letters; sequencing letters, sounds, and words, etc.
Dyspraxia - Problems with fine motor skills, such as cutting, drawing, tying shoes, writing, or any difficulties with manual dexterity and coordination.
Non-Verbal Learning Disorder - Poor sense of social skills while being verbally fluent, difficulty in interpreting facial expressions or social signals, poor sense of numbers and mathematical processing.
If your child is suspected of having a Specific Learning Disability (SLD):
Your child's teacher should request a psychological assessment for your child. (If the teacher does not request one and you feel your child should be assessed, insist that the teacher schedule one.)
The fact that it is called a "psychological assessment" is confusing for some parents, but be reassured that the assessment will first rule out learning disabilities before examining emotional issues your child may be dealing with. (See my blog: "What will Happen in Your Child's Psychological Assessment. ") The assessment will provide information to your child's educators about how to best help him in dealing with his educational struggles. Examining the child emotionally as well as academically is a good thing, because children with learning disabilities often suffer from low self-esteem. They may also have trouble making friends because their learning disability crosses over into their social situations, making it difficult to read subtle social cues from peers.
If an SLD is diagnosed:
If an SLD is discovered, your child will likely be eligible for special assistance, tutoring, or adapted learning methods designed specifically for his area of need. Do not take the diagnosis personally. As mentioned above, children with SLDs often have normal intelligence. If she struggles in a particular area, she should certainly receive assistance. You want your child to have the best educational opportunities possible. Be cooperative with your child's teacher and educators while advocating for her best interests.
