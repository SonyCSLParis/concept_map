What is a learning disability?
Some individuals, despite having an average or above average level of intelligence, have real difficulty acquiring basic academic skills. These skills include those needed for successful reading, writing, listening, speaking and/or math. These difficulties might be the result of a learning disability.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal law, defines a learning disability as a condition when a child's achievement is substantially below what one might expect for that child. Learning disabilities do not include problems that are primarily the result of intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbance, or visual, hearing, emotional or intellectual disabilities. The official definition is here .
Many children with LD have struggle with reading. The difficulties often begin with individual sounds, or phonemes. Students may have problems with rhyming, and pulling words apart into their individual sounds (segmenting) and putting individual sounds together to form words (blending). This makes it difficult to decode words accurately, which can lead to trouble with fluency and comprehension. As students move through the grades, more and more of the information they need to learn is presented in written (through textbooks) or oral (through lecture) form. This exacerbates the difficulties they have succeeding in school.
What are the types of learning disabilities?
LD is a broad term. There are many different kinds of learning disabilities. Most often they fall into three broad categories:
Other related categories include disabilities that affect memory, social skills, and executive functions such as deciding to begin a task.
Here is information on the more common forms of LD.
Dyslexia (difficulty reading)
Dyslexia is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. Reading disabilities affect 2 to 8 percent of elementary school children. To read successfully, one must:
Focus attention on the printed symbols
Recognize the sounds associated with letters
Understand words and grammar
Build ideas and images
Compare new ideas to what you already know
Store ideas in memory
A person with dyslexia can have problems in any of the tasks involved in reading. However, scientists found that a significant number of people with dyslexia share an inability to distinguish or separate the sounds in spoken words. Some children have problems sounding out words, while others have trouble with rhyming games, such as rhyming "cat" with "bat." Yet, scientists have found these skills fundamental to learning to read. Fortunately, remedial reading specialists have developed techniques that can help many children with dyslexia acquire these skills. However, there is more to reading than recognizing words. If the brain is unable to form images or relate new ideas to those stored in memory, the reader cannot understand or remember the new concepts. Other types of reading disabilities can appear in the upper grades when the focus of reading shifts from word identification to comprehension.
Here is a fact sheet and a newspaper story that give you more information about dyslexia:
Dysgraphia (difficulty writing)
Writing too, involves several brain areas and functions. The brain networks for vocabulary, grammar, hand movement, and memory must all be in good working order. A developmental writing disorder may result from problems in any of these areas. For example, a child with a writing disability, particularly an expressive language disorder, might be unable to compose complete and grammatically correct sentences.
Dyscalculia (difficulty with mathematics)
Arithmetic involves recognizing numbers and symbols, memorizing facts, aligning numbers, and understanding abstract concepts like place value and fractions. Any of these may be difficult for children with developmental arithmetic disorders, also called dyscalculia. Problems with number or basic concepts are likely to show up early. Disabilities that appear in the later grades are more often tied to problems in reasoning.
Other related conditions
Many aspects of speaking, listening, reading, writing, and arithmetic overlap and build on the same brain capabilities. It is not surprising that people can be diagnosed with more than one learning disability. For example, the ability to understand language underlies learning to speak. Therefore, any disorder that hinders the ability to understand language will also interfere with the development of speech, which in turn hinders learning to read and write.
There are many disabilities that are related to learning disabilities. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) makes it difficult for children to control their behavior and pay attention. Non-verbal learning disabilities make it hard for people to understand non-verbal communication. LD OnLine has information about these difficulties here:
Sometimes the media, the public, and even educators confuse autism with learning disabilities. They are two separate disorders. According to the Autism Society of America, autism is a developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others. Autism is defined by a specific set of behaviors and is a "spectrum disorder" affecting individuals differently and to varying degrees. There is no known single cause for autism, but increased awareness and funding can help families today.

How are learning disabilities identified?
Usually, the teacher or parent notices that the child is struggling to learn or is behind in class. An evaluation can be requested by the teacher or the parent. A comprehensive set of tests are given to see why the child has difficulty. Here are some articles on the evaluation process:
Traditionally, evaluators used the results from the assessments to determine if there was a discrepancy between the child's ability and achievement. In practice, this often meant waiting for the child to fail before a child was eligible for special education services. Today a greater effort is being made to respond to a child's special learning needs before he or she falls too far behind. This effort is called Response to Intervention.
Response to Intervention
Response to Intervention uses a tiered approach to assist students struggling in school. In Tier 1, scientific, research-based instruction is provided to all students. In Tier 2, a student whose performance is below that of his peers receives more intensive instruction from a trained specialist in a small-group setting, usually while the child stays in class. In addition, the student participates in a carefully designed intervention. In Tier 3, students who continue to have difficulty, despite the Tier 2 intervention, undergo a comprehensive evaluation. The results of the evaluation help determine whether the student is eligible to receive special education services. Each tier includes careful and consistent progress monitoring.
What is effective instruction for students with LD?
Students with learning disabilities benefit from instruction that is explicit and well sequenced. Effective teachers help students with LD learn how to use strategies for managing their assignments. For example, a teacher might teach students to use a graphic organizer that outlines the important information from a text. A different type of organizer might be used to help students remember to bring home the right supplies for a homework assignment.
Teachers often need to provide accommodations to help children learn in class. These are changes in how tasks are presented or responses are received that allow the child to do the same work as their fellow students. Students might receive the assignment in larger print or be allowed to take a spelling test by reciting the words instead of writing them. They might be given more time to complete an assignment.

It's an exciting time in the field of learning disabilities. With new procedures for identifying kids at risk and teachers using research-based instructional strategies, the needs of students with learning disabilities remain a priority in today's schools.
