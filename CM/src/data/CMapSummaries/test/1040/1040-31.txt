Established to fulfill the need of a centre where children with Learning Disabilities could be managed holistically; Shristi came into being in 1995. The period of over a decade, has been attributed to the process of learning and growing towards excellence in the field for management of Learning Disabilities. Shristi is not just about educating the differently abled. The children in the centre receive counseling, work upon their academic skills and receive some vocational training to ultimately become self supporting. Our centers provide early detection and intervention for children with Learning Disability. In the intervention the children also receive remedial teaching and therapeutic guidance. Our services comply with our objectives of looking after Learning Disability as a whole. We have developed four centers for children with Learning Disability at Vivek Vihar in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Indirapuram and Greater Noida where children come for guidance, counseling, therapeutic services and remedial training. Our project of Voice of Learning Disabled (VOLD) allows for detection of disorders at early stage.

Our Mission
To sensitize the system, reach out to most vulnerable groups, provide them professional services to build up their self esteem and help them to live a sustainable life. Shristi would also serve as a resource base for training, research and documentation in child and adolescent mental health.
We progress step by step towards our mission with the following objectives in mind:
To empower and mainstream children with special needs.
Provide early intervention services.
Generate awareness among parents about learning disorders and behavior problems.
Counseling services for parents and children.
Opportunities to enhance academic level of children.
Develop human resource.
Learning Disability is much recognized and acknowledged disability after the screening of Aamir Khan Starrer "Taare Zameen Pe". About 10% of all school children are supposed to be suffering from learning disability. The proportion is huge but the resources are limited. Regular school teachers seem to be baffled by the intriguing problem as most of them look bright but are labeled as naughty /lazy.
Specially trained resource specialists are in much demand to meet the enormity in terms of the number of students for correct diagnosis, treatment planning and management. They are placed in regular schools, special schools, rehabilitation centres, hospitals and can even establish their own private practice.     This course syllabus has been specially designed by experienced professionals keeping in mind the eclectic approach and demands of modern day schooling. This, I am sure would help produce top professionals in the field. The faculty comprises of best professionals from India and abroad. With the recent affiliation of our organization with Mcgill University, Canada will help our students have global recognition and acceptance.
Wishing you all the best!   Dr. Rajiv Nandy Chairman and Founder

Course Objectives
Statistics reveals that about 10% of school children have learning disability. Their main problem lies in reading, writing, arithmetic and social skills, though mental retardation may not be the cause. Some of them may posses very high IQ but still may not be able to cope with the regular school curriculum and evaluation. Most of these disorders are detected at a later stage causing a lot of management confusion for teachers, students and parents.
Considering the need to equip ourselves with the developments, Shristi organized a Advanced Diploma Course in Learning Disability in 2007 for the professionals working in the field.  With the advancement of technology along with daily stress and strain, and too busy a life of the urban elites, there is increase in the cases of children with learning disabilities. Therefore, the need is felt for the professionals to come together and upgrade their knowledge and skills to cope with the growing situation. The objectives are:
To acquire knowledge and skills to facilitate work with children with learning disabilities.
Develop human resource for the country.
Develop skills and provide counseling interventions to children and their parents.
Networking with other agencies.
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST - Work towards remediation of various difficulties associated with developmental disorders. Where occupational therapists tend to have substantial knowledge and skills to deal with a number of developmental disorders, Learning Disabilities, on the contrary, is one such area where their talent has not been tapped, which of course, could have added a new dimension to the innovative field of occupational therapy. Various factors including lack of proper orientation, lack of organizations which can promote them, lack of proper training are among the reasons for the same. This course is a must for occupational therapists who want to make it big in pediatric OT. Several modules in the course specifically address to the needs of occupational therapists. Not only will they learn a great deal about the various frames of references in general and sensory integration in specific but rather a holanthropic view of a child with learning disability.
SPECIAL EDUCATOR - Have always been associated to the field of education and learning. They deal directly with children having learning problems. Fast few years have been substantial for special educators with many examples of dedicated special educators who made their presence felt in the field of LD. Still many special educators suffer from agnosia of LD, having only a vague idea of the condition. This can be a major obstacle in their growth and a way leading to mediocrity. This course provides opportunity for Special educators   to equip themselves with rational and systematic approach towards the remediation of LD based on current scientific research.
PSYCHOLOGIST - Psychology is one of the major frames of reference when it comes to dealing and understanding learning disabilities. Psychologists provide a number of services to children with learning disabilities.
STUDENTS AND INTERNS OF VARIOUS RELATED COURSES- The course provides an opportunity to dwell into the fascinating world of the perplexing condition of learning disabilities where they can invent themselves to have a great and rewarding carrier ahead. Students can have a multidimensional view of the world of habilitation by learning about various theories of child development, education, learning, brain sensory integration to name a few. Interns can have hands on experience with the plenty of practical exposure given during the course which can give a head start to them in their respective field.
PARENTS - As a team member, the role of the parents in the development of their child has always been tremendous, but many a time underestimated by many professionals and also many a time by parents themselves. Parents need to have a good understanding of their child's condition, strength and limitations.  Many modules provide the parents with a stimulation program where they can learn about some practical strategies to deal with the condition and can contribute to the maximum.
SPEECH THERAPISTS - Children with learning disabilities tend to have difficulties in the areas of oral language and communication especially during childhood. Hence, call for a speech therapist to step in to play his/her role as a team member. But acknowledging the complexity of the condition, traditional speech therapist is not fully equipped to deal with children with learning disabilities. Moreover, there is a dire need of speech therapists that are trained in the field of learning disabilities.
Certification - Participants will be provided with an "Advance Diploma in learning disability" certificate under the accreditation of Shristi Child Development and Learning Institute.
(* Anyone with zeal to work in the area of clinical education from any field are allowed to join the course.)
Participants will be provided with an "Advance Diploma in learning disability" certificate under the accreditation of Shristi Child Development and Learning Institute.
