Methods of Diagnosing Learning Disabilities Vary
Parents navigating the learning disability diagnosis process may find a bewildering range of testing methods, theories of learning, and labels awaiting them. Learning disability diagnosis is an inexact science. Some experts disagree on the best ways of determining whether a learning disability exists. Why the confusion?
Diagnostic methods and standards used to diagnose learning disabilities in public schools are different from those used by evaluators in private practice.
Public schools and private evaluators are governed by different government agencies, boards, and regulations which define learning disability.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act regulations governing diagnosis of learning disabilities and other types of disabilities in public schools are somewhat general and leave the specific requirements to states to define.
Both the ICD and DSM methods of diagnosis rely heavily on an evaluator's professional judgment, which naturally varies from evaluator to evaluator. Terms used to name and describe learning disabilities in these systems are different from those used in the IDEA in public schools.
