Conflict Resolution Training Underway
Conflict: a disagreement, argument, fight, debate or dialogue between two or more people or groups.
Conflict is a normal and natural part of life. Whether you are at home, at work, at school or at play, people are bound to see things differently, even argue. Conflict is not necessarily bad, even though it is uncomfortable. Resolving everyday conflicts peacefully and productively requires learning new ways of handling difficult emotions and creating solutions.
With increased understanding and improved skills we can prevent conflicts at our school from becoming violent and we can turn problems into possibilities.
The goal of the conflict mediation program in our school is to train young people in basic steps for making peace. In the coming weeks students will be given lessons in problem-solving skills and the process of mediation. Through these lessons students come to understand that conflict can be positive and productive, that there are different and legitimate conflict styles, and that conflicts can escalate or de-escalate depending on how they are handled. Students will learn that conflict is an important part of growth and learning because understanding conflict helps us develop a better understanding of others and ourselves.
Our program will focus on Problem-solving Skills which help students begin to put it all together. Students learn the differences among negotiation, arbitration, and mediation, and they get a chance to practice negotiation - the art of talking directly to one another. They are introduced to a negotiation process that helps guide communication and that produces effective agreements.
We feel, and research supports, that students learn best in a safe, respectful environment. Many unnecessary conflicts disappear in environments fostering a sense of belonging and connection. When we use productive conflict-resolution skills, we can build better and more productive relationships with others. Throughout the curriculum we have placed teamwork, cooperative games and community building exercises to help students learn how to work together - both in general and when in conflict.
How Parents Can Help
It is critical to the progress of this effort for parents to establish an environment that repeats and reinforces these skills and attitudes. Children learn more from examples and role models than they learn from words. We encourage you to deepen your understanding of conflict resolution skills and practice them at home whenever possible.
 Learn about conflict resolution along with your child. Parent handouts in coming weeks will give you a sense of the skills your child is learning. These handouts will also list books that parents can read for more information.
 Make it clear that resorting to violence is not acceptable to you, at home, at school or in the neighborhood. Your child needs to know how you feel and that you care.
 Get involved. We invite you to be part of the program as a volunteer.
 Set a good example. How you handle conflicts can help your child learn critical skills like problem-solving and negotiation. Settle disagreements with words, not fists or threats. The example you set shows your child that conflict need not escalate into violence and aggression.
 Talk to your child - learn your childs schedule of conflict resolution lessons and ask questions. Listen to your child and help him or her to think through these lessons. A child who knows you will listen is more likely to share things that are troubling.
 Teach children that respecting others is important. Use common courtesy. It helps ease tensions that can lead to violence.
 Reinforce the skills. Practice at home - make use of daily opportunities to make these skills your own. Remember that it takes time to acquire and integrate the material and skills solidly at a personal level. Be patient as you rearrange your habits and recognize your own learning as a long-term process.
Recognizing conflict as a positive opportunity opens our eyes to a new way of handling difficult situations. We hope you continue to learn and practice these skills in daily life and treat students as resources - with compassion and an attitude that learning to resolve conflict productively is important.
