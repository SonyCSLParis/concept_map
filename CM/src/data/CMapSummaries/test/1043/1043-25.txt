If you do it early, like from the very beginning you must be prepared to recognize a whole flurry of possible learning disablities and strengths. You are going to have to be smart. You are in essence programming the foundation of acadamia into a child's mind. If you do not have a college degree, decent experience and knowledge in child education, and the ability to learn extremely fast (you are going to have to do some hard work to keep pushing your child to learn) I do not think that home schooling is for you. But if you have these things, you have no problem keeping your child focused and disciplined, and you have the time and will power to home school then perhaps it is for you and your child, especially if the school district you are in is sub-par.
i would only suggest homeschool for the first 4-5 years of public education. Those are the only years I can see it as being truely beneficial (there are a lot of tardos teaching the younger ages in public school). After that, I think it would probably be undue stress on you and probably better for your kid if he/she were taught by someone else. Once you start getting into junior high I think the level of teaching is somewhat increased, and the tardo teachers have been filtered out. The people teaching these classes aren't the ones teaching because "kids are soo cute". Another thing to think about. what are your reasons for homeschooling? That is also a very important aspect of this question.
A lot of "child education" knowledge is actually how to keep 30+ kids in their seats while you lecture them on the same thing you lectured them on the day before. As far as actually imparting knowledge to an individual kid, each kid is going to learn their own way. Teachers just learn how to get it across to a group, but I think if you know your kids learning style and methods, and have a good grasp on what you're trying to teach, you don't need to know how to get it across to the masses.
These are all good things, I definetly agree. However you need to think about your commitment in this area. You will be working most all morning and afternoon every day with your child (barring you are following the criteria to be covered, which should be supplied to you via your county's school board of education). After teaching for 5-7 hours each day, are you ready to commit to each of the said activities? It's a lot to handle; as a previous poster mentioned, teaching is not easy. Another realization to consider is that your would-be 5 year old is not able to go and do many of those said events that you listed. Chess club is obviously out; being out in the community, volunteer work, and the learning process will all require him to still have his Mom by his side. Classroom interaction is extremely important for early childhood development. There are too many factors going on that simply cannont be recreated in after-school events.
Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, recently, the National Reading Panel submitted its report to Congress. That report shows the best current research on how children learn to read. One of the significant studies included in the research is the product of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development. The research actually began as a result of the 1985 Health Research Extension Act which charged NICHD with the research task of finding out why children have trouble learning to read.
The U.S. Department of Education reports a 42% increase in the number of students with specific learning disabilities receiving special education services over the past decade, with 2.7 million students ages 6-21 currently being served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. As many as 90 percent of these students have significant, if not primary, special education needs in the area of reading. In the NICHD study, one of the most important discoveries was that 90-95% of those children with reading difficulties could be on track with their peers by third grade if they are identified at an early age and given the appropriate training. And that, Mr. President, is the greatest step we can make toward successful learning for these children. Currently, there is no readily available, scientifically based, easy- to-use screening tool to test children for reading readiness skills. And, there is no coordinated effort for parents and other early care providers to identify children who show signs of early literacy difficulties and to provide them research-based information and support.   The National Center for Learning Disabilities has recently completed a plan to provide arents, early childhood professionals, and other care providers with an easy to use early literacy screening tool, access to information about the critical importance of early oral language and literacy experiences, and resources that will inform and enhance early instruction and learning. The Report to the House-passed version of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes a recommendation that NICHD fund this initiative. I hope that as we work through the differences in this bill, adequate funds will be provided to NICHD to fund the National Early Literacy Screening Initiative.
ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata today said the National    Party education policies are a firm step in the right direction. "It's a relief to see one of the two old parties talking some sense on education.  National is starting to put the education mistakes of past days behind it.  National has clearly come on board with the child-centred approach of ACT. While this is an excellent start, they need to go further and embrace the right of every child for a decent start in life.
"ACT has already launched our Early Childhood Education Policy. We will formally launch our other education policies in the next two weeks. ACT believes National has taken a good first step, but is too timid to achieve real change for our kids:
· ACT is committed to increasing support for the early education sector, which National and Labour have ignored. We believe that children should reach primary school ready to learn.
· ACT will completely eliminate unfair zoning restrictions, rather than simply tinkering with them.
· Under a policy of child-centred funding, ACT will fund schools more equitably, regardless of their status.
· ACT believes NCEA is failing and needs to be eliminated, not just delayed for the bureaucrats to wreak more mischief.
· ACT believes in a far more thorough system of external testing than National has proposed. We want to ensure children have a thorough grounding in vital, basic skills.
· ACT has policies to address the strong concerns from parents and educators with the school curriculum. National and Labour propose no changes.
· ACT has a strategy for boosting literacy - another area where both old parties are indistinguishable. They speak of aims and targets without outlining the action that's required.
· ACT has specific proposals to address the needs of suspended children, which ensure other children are not held back. This important issue affects almost every child, yet we've heard nothing from National or Labour.
"ACT remains the political party with fresh ideas on education. While I am encouraged by National's policy announcements, I believe they need to go much further. I look forward to introducing ACT's fresh ideas and clear policies to eradicate mediocrity from our schools," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
Today is an important day for early childhood education as we launch this new ten year strategic plan for early childhood education : Pathways to the Future: Ng? Huarahi Arataki. I know that for some present in the audience, today marks the culmination of many years of committed work.  In particular, I thank Dr Anne Meade and the members of the strategic plan working group which she chaired.  The work you have done has built strong foundations for the strategy. Pathways to the Future has been developed after intense consultation between the government, the early childhood education sector, academics, and parents.  We now need to continue that collaboration so that the  implementation of the strategy can be as successful as its development has been.
The Background to the Strategic Plan
In 1999 the Labour Party manifesto contained a commitment to develop a long term strategic plan for early childhood education in consultation with the sector. We pledged to do that because of our conviction of the importance of early childhood education. There needed to be a long term commitment to improving its quality and increasing participation in it. To do that we needed a planned and stepped approach. We needed to make sure that we made the necessary changes in the right order. So, early strategies form the foundations of the plan and later strategies build on them. This strategy is best thought of as a road map. It sets out the vision of where we want to go, and it plots the journey that we must undertake to get there.
The journey began with the working group, chaired by Dr Anne Meade in August 2000. There were fifteen months consultation, many meetings, and thirteen hundred submissions. Now the journey must continue with the government working with early childhood education professionals, families, and communities to get the best results from the strategy.
Importance of Early Childhood Education
In a child's early years, the development of the brain creates the basis for on-going learning throughout life. The foundations for language are established, and the major parameters of the child's attitudes and dispositions towards the world are developed. These years are a critical learning period as children are very receptive to positive learning opportunities. Early childhood education has an important part to play in these early years. Research, here and overseas, shows that participation in quality early childhood education makes a positive difference for children, their families, and the wider society.
In quality early childhood education, children develop literacy and numeracy concepts, approaches to problem solving, social and co-operative skills, and an enjoyment of learning, all of which provide the foundation for later learning. The recently released Competitive Children at 10 research shows that, in New Zealand, the positive effects of early childhood education are still present some five years after the child has left. It also shows that children with early childhood education experiences are stronger in areas such as problem solving, communication, individual responsibility, and perseverance. While all the evidence supports participation in early childhood education, some children, often the most needy, are still missing out. That is why this strategy sets out a long term vision and plan for increasing participation in quality early childhood services.
Working Together
In today's launch, Trevor Mallard will talk about the strategy's three goals : improving, quality, increasing participation, and promoting collaborative relationships. The first two goals are long standing government goals for early childhood education. This strategy focuses on how to achieve them. The third goal, on collaboration was developed by the strategic plan working group. As you will see in Trevor Mallard's presentation, a number of the strategies can only succeed if government, parents, communities, and the early childhood education sector work together.
New Zealand's early childhood education sector is already a world leader. Our participation levels are already high by world standards. We have led the world in integrating the care and education of young children under one curriculum, Te Wh?riki. Now Pathways to the Future: Ng? Haurahi Arataki plots the journey we must take together to strengthen the sector further. I thank Trevor Mallard for the leadership and enthusiasm he has shown for early childhood education, and all those who have contributed to the drawing up of this strategy.
I am interested in doing a research paper on Early Childhood Education. What are some of the ongoing research projects?  What are some of the critical issues being considered by the leading educators?
One that fascinates me but none of my colleagues involves the assumption that benign neglect of young children in the 5-9 age range is negligent and damaging as regards teaching of reading to early non-readers ("dyslexics" etc.) or teaching writing skills. Dr. Raymond Moore, one of the leading home schooling advocates, maintains-if I understand him correctly-that there is no replicable evidence that anything is lost to the "late blooming" reader if he/she is simply let alone until, say, age 9 or 10 or, in some cases, later, given the fact that she/he is read to and is loved and is engaged in the ways in which he/she is ready maturationally. The operating assumption in schools seems to be that if we are not pounding away in one form or another to 7 or 8 year olds (mostly males) that some undefined "something" in the brain is going to be forever lost & learning potential for reading or writing forever diminished. Let's hope so, because otherwise some of us sense it is pretty totalitarian for the Leviathan State to make kids go to school if they would be equally as well off being let alone for a while.
Do any homeschoolers do early education, in the sense of teaching basic math and reading skills to under 2 year olds?  If so, have nay used Doman's materials, and what were the effects? I began preparing my son's education before he was born.
I differ from many home schoolers on the matter of early education. I checked Raymond Moore's sparse endnotes during my law school days, and found out that the persons Moore quotes DO NOT support the conclusion that Moore reaches. Later, I learned that Moore's very influential idea that academic instruction is harmful for young children (I think that is how it comes across to many home schoolers) is based in large part on the specific teachings of Moore's religious denomination. I AGREE with Moore and with many others that SCHOOL-in all of its social, academic, and other aspects-is not a good influence for children, especially young children. But Moore's original pet issue was delayed school entrance, NOT maximally effective learning, and it is unfortunate that Moore has been so influential on the home schooling community, to the exclusion of other evidence.
I have read several of Doman's books, all during my wife's pregnancy (three years ago). Doman writes an intriguing book, but years earlier I had several of his better babies on a TV documentary. They weren't impressive. I was astonished at what low-achievement adults the alumni of his baby reading program were, as described in the back portion of the revised edition of How to Teach Your Baby to Read. Well, actually, I'm NOT astonished that the Doman approach to reading instruction produces indifferent results, because I know on other grounds it is poor reading instruction. The reading instruction reading list posted at my World Wide Web site lists many, not all, of the sources for my point of view on reading instruction. If you can't access the Web I'd be happy to post that list as an FAQ here. It does seem that you can teach a 1 year old baby the difference between 20 and 21, which while not too interesting to the 1 year old except as play, seems to be beneficial in terms of offfering more interesting learning sooner. Algebra is far cooler than long division, so the faster you aquire basic math, the sooner a child can be introduced to interesting math. Same with reading, and most learning in general.
Agreed. There is no reason to slow children down. Let them pursue their curiosity. My son is endlessly curious. He is still less than three years old and already enjoys trying to read words seen on signs and what-not. Refrigerator magnets in the shape of letters of the alphabet are the royal road to teaching letter identification-my son knew all the letters by age two, with NO coaching from me. I'm intrigued by my son's developing sense of number and shape, precursors to math knowledge.
Here is a list of books useful in planning an early childhood education program in your own home. To find such books, browse in a Dewey-classified library in the 649s; the 153s through the 155s are good too. In Library of Congress-classified libraries, start with the LBs through LCs. Howard Gardner's Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983) (ISBN 0-465-02508-0) is the book to read before reading any other on early childhood education. His new book, Multiple Intelligences: The Theory in Practice (1993) further develops his theory that there are at least seven human "intelligences," namely linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. Gardner's examples are full of food for thought.
Education is about giving children opportunities. Daycare is about giving adults more free time.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU PEOPLE THINK KIDS _DO_ IN DAYCARE????? WATCH TV????? I would almost say that it looks like not a single participant in this thread has ever _had_ a kid in daycare.  Well folks, I do. I'm talking about daycare centers, not home care.  (Centers, IMO, are what we would have under federal funding.)
In daycare, my kid:
1. Interacts in a variety of social settings.
Most daycare centers have a number of areas, from play kitchens to pretend offices. Good daycare personnel direct play in these areas, stressing, for example, safety rules in the kitchen. How many parents do more in the kitchen than "Don't touch that!" or "Get away from there!"?
2. Plays with a variety of educational toys.
Look at the average daycare center, and you will find a hundred or more different toys. Certainly more toys than the average parent would (or, IMO, should) buy for their kid. Many of the toys are directly related to preschool education. (Colors, shapes, alphabet, numbers, etc)
3. Makes at least one art/craft type project each day.
If I had volumes on childhood art projects, I couldn't come up with the variety of things I've seen come home from daycare. Paper-plate puppets. Popcorn clowns. Paintings done with sponges, fingers, brushes, and feet. Things that regularly amaze me, often made with materials I'd never have thought of or couldn't have afforded.
4. Is read stories on a regular basis, from books that are available for individual perusal.
Most experts say the best way to teach children to read is to read to them. I could go on and on, but I hope I've made my point. To clarify:
Good daycare _is_ education. It isn't just a storage unit that parents toss the kid into while they rush off to get in that extra tennis game or finish that project for the boss. A child learns _vital_ skills in daycare, as well as early academics. I've seen educators who bemoan the fact that we wait until five or six to start "formally" educating kids. Most_ childhood educators that I've read say that most children can be taught to read well before they enter first grade. (Early reading, btw, is closely correlated with superior performance in school, though I've seen experts argue both causality directions.) What golden rule was handed down that said that children aren't ready to "learn" before a certain age?
In my own super ego package, there is the following command: "do not eat with your fingers". That is evidently coming from childhood, from early education. So in my adult life, when I am dining out in a restaurant, I am using a fork and not my fingers. There is not necessarily an entity here: that is pure conditioning and programming. The main reason why I have doubts about the entities business, is that I could never really spot any entity in myself. I perceive a control and regulation system , but I don't have the feeling that there are sentient beings here, with a time track and a personality.
That is the main reason why I did not continue on the scn bridge: I cannot deal with things I cannot perceive. Continuing with the example above, to some degree I am inhabited by the "ghosts" of my parents and teachers, as the commands they gave me in my childhood are still alive, some of them. But this does not mean that I am housing in myself my parents as entities: that is some mental copy of a small fragment, but not alive beings. I suspect that a large part of the scn BTs are in fact mental copies of other beings, but not real alive beings. Now if you consider that I am invaded by legions of BTs, do you have any idea about how I could detect them?
Vietnam has a long history of programmatic efforts focused on the health, nutrition, and psychosocial needs of children in the 0-6 age group. Emphasis on this age group has received renewed attention as economic and social factors, including increased rates of maternal employment and school enrollment, as well as changes to the extended family system, have given rise to an increasing number of young children in need of care.
Recognizing this demand, the Ministry of Education has placed early childhood development high on its agenda. A new department has been created with responsibility to provide adequate health, nutrition, and early education services; to increase coverage of both formal and informal programmes; and to provide parental education programmes focussed on health, education, nutrition, and family planning.
In Vietnam, child-care services for children 0-3 are provided through both formal and informal systems. Approximately thirty percent are enrolled in formal day care programmed. Parallel to this system is an indigenous, informal arrangement of family day care. Family or home-based centres are most often run by elderly retired grandmothers who have raised several children of their own. Capitalizing on this indigenous form of care, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, has agreed to strengthen this low-cost community-based strategy. In accomplishing this objective, the Ministry of Education with collaboration from UNICEF have agreed to:
Support the development of a Network of Home Day Care Centres located within the community in an effort to recognize and build on local practices. Enable Home Day Care Centres to meet the developmental needs of children through the establishment of governmental standards and regulations. Develop an informal training programme that emphasizes the psychomotor, sensory, and emotional stimulation of children. Integrate the Home-Based Child-Care Centre with existing social support services, including community and district health centres.
The idea of funding early education to stave off future problems is certainly not a new idea.  Liberals have been touting it for decades. Research has shown early childhood education to be effective. Of course, funding of early education needs individuals willing to spend tax dollars.
Children from low-income families who get preschool and early- grades education and whose parents get certain services are much less likely to be abused and neglected, according to a study released today. The findings by Arthur Reynolds, a UW-Madison professor of social work and human development, are published in the current issue of the journal Child Development. Many factors contribute to a child's likelihood of being maltreated, Reynolds said, with poverty high among them. Poverty causes social isolation and stress that increase the risk of abuse.
"Low-income families living in high-poverty neighborhoods are one of the big predictors of childhood abuse and neglect," Reynolds said. Reynolds studied the effects of the Chicago School District's Child-Parent Centers on those who attended the centers since 1985. Such programs can lower the risk of abuse by empowering parents and relieving some of the stress of poverty, Reynolds said.
The intervention centers, federally funded and administered by the Chicago public schools since 1967, help children and provide services to parents. Center teachers help 3- to 9-year-olds with language arts and math. Resource coordinators help the parents get the support and services they need to care for their children. By reviewing more than 1,400 official records on child abuse, the researchers found that children in the program were 52 percent less likely to be mistreated than a group who didn't attend.
They also discovered that abuse and neglect was less likely with longer involvement in the program. Those who were enrolled for more than four years were 48 percent less likely to be abused than those enrolled less than four years. Reynolds said the study is the first to show a school-based educational intervention program with intensive parent involvement can reduce maltreatment. "Most other interventions to prevent child abuse have not proved effective," he said.
