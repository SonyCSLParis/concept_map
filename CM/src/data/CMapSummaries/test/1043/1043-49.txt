Road to Reading
Is There A Problem? Recognizing the Early Warning Signs
By Donesa Walker, M.Ed. Reading Specialist
"Right lane closed ahead, merge left." Warning signs are a critical part of our driving experience. Without them we are not always sure how to respond to what lies ahead. The same can be said of learning how to read. Dr. Phillip Levin (with The Help Group/University of California Los Angeles Neuropsychology Program, summer 2005 newsletter) explains, "Parents should be aware of, and actively monitor, their child's development to look for these developmental markers. If parents note that several of the critical skills are not present, this may be an early warning sign of potential reading difficulties and intervention should begin as soon as possible. Parents, especially those with histories of reading and/or language difficulties, should take note of their children's early language, behavioral and cognitive development. Documenting these milestones can be a useful tool for parents and professionals to help determine if the child requires intervention."
Reading Readiness Checklist
A Preschool age child can: • discriminate rhyming words • produce rhyming words • divide sentences into words • divide words into syllables • divide words into phonemes • identify a phoneme by its position in a word (beginning, middle, end) • delete roots, syllables, and phonemes example: "Say cowboy. Now say it again, but don't say boy." • substitute a phoneme to form a new word example: Say "f" - "u" - "n" "What word is that?"; now say it again but change the "f" to "s."
A Child who is age 6 can: • identify sounds and letters (sound/symbol relationship) • blend sounds together • begin to decode words • decode nonsense words • segment words into syllables • write words • write sentences

The signs that indicate a child might be having difficulty with prereading skills can be seen as early as age 4, and reading deficiencies can be diagnosed long before third grade. If warning signs are noticed and the appropriate intervention applied, many reading problems can be corrected or circumvented altogether. Below are some early warning signs and reading milestones for parents to know (it is important to remember that development varies from child to child and the warning signs milestones described in this article are guidelines and may not always be cause for concern):
Children who start talking "late," have articulation/pronunciation difficulties, or have delayed vocabulary growth.
Children who do not, by age 2 or 3, recognize pictures, symbols, signs and logos such as Target or McDonald's. Although this is not "reading," the knowledge that signs and symbols have consistent meaning is an important pre-reading skill (i.e., recognizing letters and knowing their sounds).
Children who are not, by age 5, able to identify letters of the alphabet, days of the week, and the numbers 1 through ten. This ability signals sequential memory, which is necessary in learning to read longer words. Also at this age, children should also recognize a few letters from their own name, especially the first sound/letter, know three words that begin with that letter, and recognize words that rhyme, as well as those that do not rhyme.
Research has shown that early intervention can result in significant positive outcomes for children who show signs of reading challenges. Nearly 70% of students who are identified and receive research-based early intervention can learn to read at an average grade level. Unfortunately, only 10% of students with reading difficulties are diagnosed by age 7. The majority of children who do not receive help are more likely to be delayed in learning and less efficient readers throughout their lifetime. Although cognitive testing and intervention at any age can increase reading skills, the earliest interventions can prevent future struggles. Speech and language therapists, psychologists, and developmental pediatricians can recommend specific interventions that target delays in the key areas of concern.
Parents know their children better than anyone and are usually the first to see the signs that reading milestones are not being met. Once a child is in kindergarten, sometimes it's the teacher that notices a delay. In either case, the early warning signs are there to guide and direct parents and professionals to the many options for assessment and intervention. Reading is a critical life skill and should be nurtured in order to ensure a child's success.
