Join your child for a school lunch and meet the school catering team
Offer to start a compost scheme for your school and help the children to manage it themselves
Run a gardening club - If you can spare an hour each week, help the children grow vegetables or herbs in beds or containers in the school grounds or in the class room
Share your experiences at a school assembly or in the classroom - whether you're a farmer, keen gardener or run a food business you'll have something to offer. You could ask the school to carry out a 'skills audit' - There may be lots of expertise linked to your school. Many parents, grandparents and friends are happy to share their knowledge and expertise.
Get involved with a cooking club sharing recipes and tips - if you're stuck for ideas then check out the quarterly Cook School magazine from Focus on Food
Write a school newsletter - get people inspired by interviewing staff, pupils and parents or keep a photo diary of the school garden throughout the year
