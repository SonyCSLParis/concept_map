Getting involved in your child's school
Ways to get involved
There are three main ways which parents, carers and guardians can be involved in supporting their children's learning.
Learning at Home
Parents are the first and ongoing educators of their own children and should receive information and support to help develop their child's learning at home, in the community and at school.
Home/School Partnership
Schools must be open to the involvement of parents in the work they do and they should consider ways of providing information that helps parents engage with school and their children's education.
Parental Representation
The Edinburgh vision for parental involvement centres on 'involving families, schools and communities in improving the lives of children and young people' ( Edinburgh's Parental Involvement Strategy ). Currently, in Edinburgh , it is encouraging to note the number of Parent Councils already established.  The number of parent councils set up out of the total number of schools is as indicated below:
Primary Schools 80 out of a possible 87
Secondary Schools 23 out of a possible 23
Special Schools 8 out of a possible 10
Nursery Schools 6 out of a possible 15
If you are not already on a Parent Council , why not join or become involved in a sub-group? Talk to your Parent Council Chair, or where no Council is in place, to your Head Teacher.
