Staying Involved in School
Most parents don't have time to be fully involved in their child's education, but it's important to be consistent about communicating with your child and your child's teacher to put together an accurate picture of your child's academic experience. By talking with both, you can ensure that you'll be able to support your child as effectively as possible.
Everyday Tips for Parents
Do: Ask what your child thinks of her or his school-some have a strong attachment, while others feel uncomfortable or unattached. Ask your son or daughter which part of school is his or her favorite. (Don't be surprised if your younger children answer "recess" or "lunch.")
Ask: How Was School? Read your child's school newspaper or the community newspaper to keep up-to-date on what's happening at school. Instead of asking your child "How was your day at school?" every day after he or she gets home, talk about some of the issues you've come across in the paper.
Make Time to Connect: The lives of teens and preteens change with dizzying speed, so you'll have to ask questions if you want to keep up. Make time to connect over a favorite meal, in the car, or on a walk so that the conversation can flow into what's really going on.
Ask a Teacher: If your child is reluctant to talk about school, try talking to her or his teacher; if there is a problem in the classroom, your child's teacher can fill you in on the details.
Do: Ask what would make the school experience more enjoyable, and see if there's anything you can do to help. The more your child enjoys going to school, the more engaged he or she will be.
Stay Involved in Your Child's Education
5 Easy Ways to Encourage School Bonding:
1. Do: Encourage your children to participate in before- and after-school activities to maintain school involvement outside of the school day. These programs are not always well-publicized, so check with your school office to find out about opportunities.
2. Show Some Spirit! As kids start to become more aware of their school colors, consider investing in school T-shirts, sweatshirts, and pajamas (if you can afford it). Another option is to buy plain t-shirts in your school's colors, or to get shoe laces in those colors from your local craft store.
3. Attend Events: School involvement isn't limited to just students. Show your support of your child's school by reading the school newspaper, attending concerts and sporting events, and encouraging your child to attend social events, such as prom and homecoming dances.
4. Celebrate! If your child enjoys school competitions, celebrate big events such as state championships, music festivals, speech tournaments or other less traditional forms of school involvement.
5. Stay Involved: Stay involved in your child's education by participating with her in service projects (such as food or book drives), attending parent-teacher conferences, and volunteering in the school district.
Parents Ask: FAQ's about School Involvement
Aren't kids embarrassed by their parents' involvement in their school?
While some children may be apprehensive about parental involvement in their school, most kids are happy to have their parents helping out in some way or another. And if you start early in your child's educational career, it will become familiar and expected. If your child strongly opposes your involvement, you can find less-visible ways of taking part in his education and supporting his school success. Get ideas here &gt;
How much parental involvement in school is too much?
It's easy to make a big difference in your child's educational life without being overly involved. Helping your child succeed in school will be very beneficial in the long run. By letting your children know that you're there to help them with any school-related matters and being actively involved in the school community, you can be assured that you're having a positive influence in your child's school success. You can balance your enthusiasm with respect for your child and her or his teachers; be present and helpful, but avoid being a "helicopter parent" who hovers and criticizes every interaction.
How should I communicate with my child's teacher?
Different teachers prefer different communication methods-some prefer talking in person or on the phone; others communicate best via e-mail or notes sent back and forth. Talk to your child's teacher about the best way to get in touch. Remember that, in addition to talking about your child's school performance, it's also important to have friendly, casual conversations with teachers.
My child does well in school. Do I still need to attend parent-teacher conferences?
Even if your child excels academically, it's still important to stay in contact with his or her teacher. Going to conferences-and other forms of parental involvement in school-shows both your child and your child's teacher that you care about your child's school success. Talking about your son or daughter's progress can help you gain insight into his or her educational strengths, as well as the areas in which he or she may require additional help.
