"I can no other answer make, but, thanks, and thanks." - William Shakespeare.
Volunteers play a fundamental role at Westtown School and enable the school to offer a wealth of activities and events for the enrichment and enjoyment of the entire school community -- and, in many cases, for the community-at-large. Every volunteer opportunity at Westtown ultimately benefits the students, the faculty, and/or the entire Westtown community. This is true whether the activity directly supports a student, helps a school department, or supports a special community building or fund-raising event.
We know from experience that volunteering can sometimes seem a thankless task. But Westtown School is truly grateful for all its volunteers. So "thanks, and thanks." Without volunteers the school would not be able be able to accomplish nearly as much as it does.
There are many ways to get involved, and Westtown School greatly values any amount of time you can donate -- whether you have a lot or a little bit of time to donate, whether you can help at school or from home, and whether you can help during the day, in the evening, or on weekends. Please take the time to review this summary of some of the volunteer opportunities at Westtown. If you want to be involved, we can make it so!
If you are interested in volunteering, please contact the Alumni & Special Events Office at alumni@westtown.edu or 610-399-7941.
Thank you for your interest!
Support Students
Parent Council
Each division has an active parent council. For more information, please contact the appropriate division's office.
Host Family Program: This program offers a few ways to get involved --
Act as a host family to an international boarding student or a non-local U.S.-based boarding student . Host families are not required to invite their students over for sleepovers, but we do suggest you invite your student to dinner once a trimester, attend an athletic event once a trimester, remember his/her birthday, email his/her parents once a trimester, and help your student feel cherished and loved! You will be supported along the way with an orientation in the Fall, a packet that will provide you with all the resources you will need, formal events where you and your student can mingle, and the promise of continued support to ensure that the experience is a mutually gratifying one.  For more information about the Host Family Program , please click here .
Support the international host family program by assisting Pat MacPherson, the coordinator, with clerical tasks and events such as the annual Halloween party and Sushi &amp; Sweets. For more information, contact Pat at pat.macpherson@westtown.edu  or 610-399-7766.
