With the Ministry of Education's support, New Zealand schools are set up to give the community a say in deciding how their school works. You're encouraged to have a close relationship with your son or daughter's school and help support their learning at home.
Here are some ways you can support your teen's learning:
read school newsletters and attend school events
prepare for and attend parent-teacher interviews
talk to your teen regularly about what they've learned at school and what they're finding easy or hard
talk to your son or daughter's form teacher and dean promptly if you have any questions or concerns
encourage your teen to set aside a regular time each day to do homework (read more about helping with homework)
Other ways to be involved
Have your say on any school consultation issues/topics.
Get to know who is on your school's board of trustees (they have regular meetings and must listen to what parents want).
Vote in the three-yearly elections of the board of trustees.
Consider attending a board meeting if you're interested in standing for election on the board of trustees.
Let the school know if you can volunteer or be a parent help.
Find out if the school has a parent group that you can join.
Ask your school how else you can get involved.
