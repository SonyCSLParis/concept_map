Catholic Organisations
GET INVOLVED!
How can you be involved in the work of the Council? Are you interested in issues like curriculum development, school resources, student well-being, school transport, Indigenous education, school affordability, building stronger partnerships between home and school, Catholic identity?  Then we need you!  Parents and carers with children in Catholic schools are able to participate in discussion and action around these sorts of issues in a variety of ways and at different levels.
We understand that not everyone has the time to sit on committees and attend meetings but you can still be involved by being informed!
If you want to get more actively involved there are lots of ways you can do this:
1. Attend your P&amp;F or School Association meetings and ask for these issues to be on the agenda from time to time for discussion. 2. Join a School Board. 3. Ask for guest speakers or school staff to present to the P&amp;F or Board on topical issues. 4. Use the school newsletter to highlight issues and start a discussion 5. Through your P&amp;F (or school association) join your diocesan parent organisation.  If your diocese doesn't have one - find out how you can support the development of one or see what other opportunities there are at the diocesan level for parent involvment. 6. If you're at an Independent Catholic school, your P&amp;F can join the CCSP directlty. 7. Attend opportunities for parent 'professional development' run at either the diocesan or state level 8. If you're already actively involved in your diocesan association - have you thought about putting your hand up to be a CCSP State Council member? 9. CCSP members (and their diocesan colleagues) have the opportunity to sit on state committees such as the NSW Board of Studies, curriculum committees, the Quality Teaching Council, the NSW Catholic Education Commission and other bodies. 10. State Council members have the opportunity to be involved at the national level.
How do I get involved on the CCSP State Council? The 11 Diocesan Parent Associations are members of the Council. Catholic systemic schools affiliate through these bodies. Independent Catholic Schools affiliate directly to the CCSP.  Each member organisation (including the group of Independent schools) can have one voting representative on State Council.  Most diocesan Parent Associations also send an alternative representative to State Council meetings as an observer.
State Council meets at least 4 times per year face to face in Sydney.  Members would then be involved in their diocesan, regional and school based meetings too.
Below is a list of all Diocesan parent bodies in NSW and ACT. These organisations are the contacts for parents in each Diocese. All parents are actively encouraged to contact their local body to get advice and informtion and to find out ways of becoming more involved.
Independent Catholic School parents are also encouraged to make contact with the various Diocesan Parent organisations to find out about programs and other activities that may be open to them.
