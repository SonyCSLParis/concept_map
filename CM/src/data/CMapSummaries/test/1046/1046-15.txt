Strengthening School-Family Connections: A Conversation with Anne Henderson
In the late summer of 2003, about 50 members of the MiddleWeb Listserv joined school/family expert Anne Henderson for an important conversation about strengthening the linkages between middle schools and the families of the students they serve.
UPDATE: In late 2006, Anne and several colleagues published a new edition of Beyond the Bake Sale , now subtitled The Essential Guide to Family-School Partnerships (The New Press, 2006). Read excerpts from the book and find out how to order at the website of the National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education.
Welcome to our two-day conversation about strengthening the connections between schools and the parents, families and communities they serve.
We're joined by Anne Henderson, a consultant and researcher who specializes in school/family relationships. On a personal note, I've had the opportunity to work with Anne at various times during our long careers. Anne and I wrote/edited a report for the Jefferson County (Louisville KY) Community Accountability Team, "Every Child Counts: Raising Student Achievement in the Middle Grades." The report was based on the work of community volunteers who visited five middle schools and spent many days observing classrooms and interviewing principals, teachers, parents and students. The two-fold purpose was to learn first-hand about the district's progress in middle school achievement, and to lay the groundwork for an ongoing partnership with the schools.
I've also attended sessions of KY's Commonwealth Institute for Parent Leadership led by Anne, and I can share that she has a great rapport with parents from all walks of life.
With that full disclosure out of the way, let me invite Anne to introduce herself and perhaps pose a question to you.
John Norton Listserv moderator
Anne Henderson introduced herself and posed some questions.
Thanks for the nice intro, John. And thanks to all of you who will be tuning in (or is that a phrase from the ancient past?) today and tomorrow to discuss issues that surround engaging parents in the middle grades.
Let me fill you in a bit about me and my work. For many years (1978-1994) I was with the National Committee for Citizens in Education, a group aimed at "putting the public back in the public schools." Hayes Mizell was on NCCE's board, which is where we met 25 years ago. You may have seen a book I co-authored, called Beyond the Bake Sale: An Educator's Guide to Working with Parents (1987). I'm working on an updated version now.
Another big piece of my work is tracking the research about parent involvement and its impact on student achievement. The first research review was The Evidence Grows: Parent Participation and Student Achievement , published by NCCE in 1981. Updates were issued in 1987 and 1994 by NCCE. Last year, the fourth in the Evidence series was published by the SW Educational Development Lab. (to get a free copy in pdf, go to www.sedl.org) I'll be referring to this body of research as our conversation progresses.
A big part of what I do is translate research and other technical jargon (educationese, for example) into language that a lay audience can understand and relate to. Parent Leadership Associates recently published a report that I wrote called No Child Left Behind: What's in it for Parents . It tries to explain the law in a reader-friendly way and identifies six key leverage points parents can use (with tips on how to use them) to make sure their children get a high quality education. If you want to check it out, go to http://www.plassociates.org
John Norton is one of my most valued colleagues in this work, so of course I agreed to this chat when he asked me. I'm hoping to get some good ideas from YOU for my Beyond the Bake Sale update and future work. John has sent me some previous dialogs about engaging parents on this listserv, so I have some idea about your concerns.
I'd like to start the conversation by talking about an important study on parent involvement by Kathy Hoover-Dempsey and Howard Sandler. They looked at what attitudes (or "constructs") influence parents' choices to become involved. They identified three key constructs:
1. Role construction -- a fancy term for how we understand what part we will play in a particular setting. Parents need to understand that being actively involved in their children's learning is something they should do, and that it will help their child. And that teachers and other school staff expect them to play this role. They also need to understand what this role involves.
2. Efficacy -- another fancy term for feelings of self-confidence and power. Parents need also to feel that if they become involved, they can make a difference, and they can do a good job of it.
3. Invitation -- Finally, parents need to feel invited -- by the school and by their child -- to do this. That if they come to school, they will be treated with respect and made to feel welcome. And that their children want them to be there and will feel good about it.
Now, let's think about these three things in light of middle school. How do you think parents construct their role around being involved when their kids enter the middle grades? Do they feel it's time to let go? Do they feel that staying involved is expected of them? And in what ways? What are your schools doing to encourage parents to stay involved and help them think about how to adjust the ways they're involved as their kids get older?
What about feelings of efficacy? The academics in middle school are far more complex than in elementary school. Parents may feel they don't know enough to help their kids, or know how to approach them to help at this age. Do you think their own memories of that age could get in the way? What are your schools doing to bolster families' confidence that they can help their children? What kinds of information and other messages are you conveying about how kids this age learn, what they are learning, and what parents can do to support them?
Then there's the question of invitation. Middle schools are usually bigger, farther away, and more complex in structure by far than elementary schools. Who exactly would a parent be able to relate to at your school? The homeroom teacher? An advisor? What messages is the school sending to welcome families and help them plug into the school? Do your schools have parent involvement policies that are widely known? What opportunities do your schools offer for parents to be involved?
The schools around here are becoming far more culturally and economically diverse, and your communities probably are, too. So this is another level of complexity added to the mix. Looking at this development through these three constructs can be helpful. What do you think? What's on your minds?
Anne T. Henderson Institute for Education and Social Policy Washington, DC 20012
IN HER FIRST MESSAGE to the list, Anne included three questions. Why don't we break them down into smaller bites. Anne can lead us from one to the other when it seems a good time.
She described three attitudes/constructs identified by researchers that influence parents' choices to become involved. The first was:
1. Role construction -- a fancy term for how we understand what part we will play in a particular setting. Parents need to understand that being actively involved in their children's learning is something they should do, and that it will help their child. And that teachers and other school staff expect them to play this role. They also need to understand what this role involves.
AND THEN SHE ASKED:
How do you think parents construct their role around being involved when their kids enter the middle grades? Do they feel it's time to let go? Do they feel that staying involved is expected of them? And in what ways? What are your schools doing to encourage parents to stay involved and help them think about how to adjust the ways they're involved as their kids get older?
I think parents of middle schoolers are, like middle schoolers, in different places as far as perceiving their roles. My experience is that there is a whole range from some parents wanting to be in classrooms to parents feeling that it's time for them back off and give the kids more "space". That being said, it seems that we should probably provide a range of possibilities for keeping parents engaged in supporting their children's schooling.
Chris Toy, Principal Freeport Middle School Freeport, Maine
Hi Anne,
Thanks for bringing all your experience to this conversation!
On the question of role construction I think that most parents think they can be less involved by Middle School for a lot of reasons. I think you were on the mark in mentioning the complex curriculum and when we add language barriers, parents feel lost. If we add the uninviting atmosphere that many schools and or staff members present, coupled with the way many adolecsents act... like they'd rather not know their parents exist...it's no wonder parents aren't constantly in our buildings.
I'd like to stay on the "role" point a little longer. I haven't seen your Beyond the Bake Sale book, but I find the title intriguing. I'd like to really spend some time talking about what the role of parents and family members might be and the ways we can co-construct a description with parents.
As a parent turned teacher, I felt some real resistance when I wanted to move beyond the bake sale role. After a few years, I was painfully aware of the special acceptance I was afforded when the staff learned that I was going back to school. Then, I was accepted and information was shared freely with me. The same was not always true for my fellow parents, many of whom were women of color and who spoke English as a second language.
What ideas or experience have folks had with co-construction? I'm thinking specifically of things that go beyond fund raising and disciplinary back-up.

Beverly Maddox responded to Anne's three constructs:
1. Role construction -- a fancy term for how we understand what part we will play in a particular setting. Parents need to understand that being actively involved in their children's learning is something they should do, and that it will help their child. And that teachers and other school staff expect them to play this role. They also need to understand what this role involves.
Most of the parents whose children whose children attend my urban, predominantly low income school do not seem to understand their role in their child's school life. There's no doubt they care about their child's formal learning, but don't assume an active role. That's the school's fault (administrators, counselors, teachers), I think. Over the years, the norm has become "No parents involved." PTA membership is low, low, low.
2. Efficacy -- another fancy term for feelings of self-confidence and power. Parents need also to feel that if they become involved, they can make a difference, and they can do a good job of it.
So, somehow, we need to validate and reinforce the parents? How?
3. Invitation -- Finally, parents need to feel invited -- by the school and by their child -- to do this. That if they come to school, they will be treated with respect and made to feel welcome. And that their children want them to be there and will feel good about it.
I don't believe we educators extend a welcome to the parents and include them in any decision-making way except when a child is misbehaving or failing. How do I invite and convince my students' parents to assume a role? One other obstacle is how to convince the students that this is a good idea, too. They don't want their parents "in their business."
Now, let's think about these three things in light of middle school. How do you think parents construct their role around being involved when their kids enter the middle grades?
Sixth grade parents are more involved that grades 7 and 8, both in PTA type activities and by initiating teacher contact. By 8th grade, parent involvement dwindles to one or two per class who initiate contact with teachers. It seems the role of parents is very limited.
Our Hispanic students are rapidly increasing to a projected 10% this coming year. Personally, I suspect it will be a bit larger due to the increasing number of Hispanic families living in our attendance zone. The school makes no attempt at outreach.
Contacting our parents is the first and most difficult problem facing us--inaccurate addresses in the records, outdated or no telephone numbers, students who don't deliver school letters, etc. Putting some creative thought into this is overdue.
I want parents to feel welcome in my classroom to the point of feeling ok about "dropping in."
Beverly Maddox
This reminds me of some teachers I've worked with who actually work with the students to put on a meal to which their families are invited. This was really successful in bringing parents to the school. The students made "formal" invitations for the parents. Sometimes it was planned around a major holiday like Thanksgiving or an evening event.

Deborah Bambino writes: What ideas or experience have folks had with co-construction? I'm thinking specifically of things that go beyond fund raising and disciplinary back-up.
We've taken the route of defining the overall role of middle school parents as "Partners in supporting the mission of the middle school". Although that does include involvement in fundraising, it also includes volunteering to chaperone class trips, co-curricular activities, dances, tutoring, substitute teaching, office work, mentoring, school and systemwide goal setting, and budget discussions.
For me the "aha" piece has been to extend the organization of the middle school to include parents by creating a teamlike structure and expectation for facilitating communication in order to accomplish tasks and to address issues.
Chris Toy
Linda Emm asked the key question: How do we get parents in the door?
First, I've been excited about this conversation, because it is the area where my school (and district!) need the most help. We are clearly not doing this well. Especially, as has been mentioned, once kids get out of elementary school.
Part of it is, of course, their role. "Who will they be?" in the school. I have never asked for a parent or student aide, because I have no clue how to really engage them beyond the mundane. Well, let me ammend that. I do engage parents all the time when we do shows - they sew, and hammer, and design, and do hair, etc. Because, to me, this is real work.
And I think that must be the secret ingedient. We have to find real work for parents to do in our middle schools.
THEN... the biggest obstacle... is how do we get them there???? I think their kids are conflicted about wanting their parents there. Some love it, and those are often the parents we see in the sparsely attended PTSA meetings. But, more often, they don't communicate with their parents about what is going on. Short of mailings (which we try on occasion - but event then, our kids are often home before parents, and they are savvy about return addresses that look school related. Federal crime aside, they just don't get delivered, somehow.
So, we also need an extra layer of getting kids to see this as a partnership which is not out to "get them", but to support them. And then, it has to be that.
So.... I have tons of questions about getting parents in the door, and then doing real work with them when they are there. Miami is an immigrant community. Schools don't seem like the friendliest, most accessible place to some parents. And then there's the time issue of parents working two or more jobs, or parents with no transportation, child care, etc. Not insurmountable, but huge, huge issues.
I can't wait to hear how others address these issues. What working out there???
(And thanks, Anne, for helping us look at these topics with an eye to changing our practice!)

Boy Howdy! With the exception of being an immigrant community (but we're growing), this could be a description of my school. How to create real work for parents who want to assume their rightful roles in their child's education is an essential question. Job descriptions for classroom and off-campus volunteers might be the first step. How about a job description for middle-school parents? Now, there's a presumptious, potentially offensive idea! But it could be turned into something useful and engaging.
Beverly Maddox
Beverly wrote: How about a job description for middle-school parents? Now, there's a presumptious, potentially offensive idea! But it could be turned into something useful and engaging.
Beverly: I think you're onto something! I've been reading your messages with great interest. Under NCLB, Title I schools are supposed to develop a school-family compact. Most schools just develop a laundry list of things that teachers would like parents to do and ask them to sign off. A compact is just another term for a job description isn't it -- and basically, that's role construction.
The question is how you do it. The wrong way is to have teachers develop the parents' job description and push it on them. The right way is to have a discussion among parents and teachers: what could teachers do that would help parents to help their kids? what could parents do that would help teachers engage their kids in learning? what could the school do to support parents and teachers to work better together?
Having such a discussion would build trust, develop a closer relationship, and identify what parents and teachers in your school want from each other. We all wonder, what should we do? where do we start? Well, this is a great way to start.
Chris Toy shared some successful strategies:
Mostly successful things we do:
Parent night to provide input to the school committee regarding budget priorities and school committe goals. Parents show up for this evening because the see it as a way of getting their voices heard by the school committee and by the building principal. There is a facilitated discussion around the question of What has worked well for your child(ren) in our school(s) and what has not worked so well? There is also discussion about what things might be added and what things might be discontinued. On the whole this evening's discussion has generated significant support for things such as expanded library services, expanded foreign language, expanded technology resources, and a renovation of the middle school facility.
Family night where a facilitator comes in and guides the adults and the students through a series of activities designed to foster cross generational communication. Everytime we've done this we've had nearly 100 participants and it has always been positive. Perhaps the key is the kids. Include the kids and the parents come.
Transition nights where middle school staff, students, and parents talked with incoming parents about things middle school. Basically a panel discussion with incoming parents asking questions of middle school folks. Topics brought up include homework, scheduling, grading, lunch, peer relationships, workload, communication, sports and extracurriculars. We usually get 50 or 60 parents for this evening.
Guest speakers-Police Liason officer, he brings in all kinds of stuff and talks with parents about what's out there and what's not. We also have an evening with the guidance folks to talk about parenting and peer issues in the middle. Another night we've had is a candidate's night where we sponsor a panel discussion for local politicians just before local elections. These vary between a dozen to a couple dozen folks. In all cases other parents who couldn't make it have requested notes on email so we usually do have a follow up on the parent email list.
At one meeting a month, expect for December that just about takes up the year!

Chris, this is a nice variety of options and opportunities. What kind of response have you gotten to this? Would you say that a good cross-section of your families takes part in one way or the other?
One situation I often encounter, in middle and high schools especially, is an in-crowd of middle class families that are very involved at the school. Families of color, and families with lower incomes, tend to stay away. Have you had that problem? If so, any ideas about how to deal with it?
For me the "aha" piece has been to extend the organization of the middle school to include parents by creating a teamlike structure and expectation for facilitating communication in order to accomplish tasks and to address issues.
What do you mean by a teamlike structure? What does that look like? How is communication facilitated? What kind of roles do parents play on the "teams?" This might be an interesting model.

Yes, there is a tendency for the middle and upper middle class parents to take over. We've been lucky to have some good corporate partners that have allowed parents to take time from work to attend meetings in the past. Most parents seem to have internet and email at home or work so this seems to be leveling the playing field to some degree. I get all income levels responding to requests that are sent out via email.
Color is pretty much non existent in Freeport. Class differences are evident and increasing. I think, though, there is a homogenousness in terms of what parents want for their kids. A good education that will give them lots of options in life. I think our schools do a pretty good job responding to this wish and have good parental support as a result.
What do you mean by a teamlike structure? What does that look like? How is communication facilitated? What kind of roles do parents play on the "teams?" This might be an interesting model.
The teamlike structure is that there is a parent team leader that has a role in the governance of the school. The parent team leader meets regularly with the teacher team leaders and has a pieceof the agenda and a voice in the discussions. As with the teacher teams (by grade in our school) There are grade level parent leaders that meet regularly (monthly) to discuss needs and plans. These leaders organize a phone tree and take charge of facilitating communication among parents and between teams. It's a mirror image of how the school is organized.

My response as a parent and as a teacher differ.
As a parent of a middle schooler (going into 7th grade this year) I feel left out. Left out by my daughter and by the school. Let me explain.
When she was in elementary school we received weekly updates, the teachers were available for conferencing at any time, we were welcomed into the classrooms to volunteer and she actually wanted us to be there. Now that she is a middle schooler, I have seen that shift of being there for her turn the other way. Personally, she seems embarrassed if we show up at functions. She does not want us to volunteer at anything. She wants to be dropped off and have us disappear as soon as possible. Interestingly, she doesn't mind so much if her father is the one to stay, but I am totally told to not show up! I am sure this is the normal adolescent growing up, finding their way to becoming individuals, etc. So I don't mind too much and try no to take it too personally when this occurs. This is what I do mind though.
The middle school she attends teams their students. In all grades the team consists of 4 people, the basic teachers. There are two scheduled parent conferences and one back to school night - no open house. The parent conferences this year were student led, which I wholly support, but at no time did the teacher of the subject set a time to talk with us nor were we encouraged to set up an appointment at another time. Phone calls to teachers were not returned on a timely basis, nor were concerns voiced ever validated or resolved.
My opinion is twofold on the role construction of parents relationships with teachers and vice versa: Children of this age will not proactively encourage their parents to stay or become involved in their learning experiences and teachers do not want to develop relationships with the parents of their students. I think the latter might have something to do with class size. In elementary there was one teacher a parent had to talk with who was responsible for 20-30 kids and in middle school you now have to seek out up to 10 different teachers and the teachers are responsible for, in my district approximately 120 kids per team.
My question then becomes, how do we maintain or open the doors of communication between parents and teachers and parents and children?
Carolyn Beitzel
Chris had this to say about middle schoolers as go-betweens:
More often, they don't communicate with their parents about what is going on.
We've determined that depending on middle school students as the primary carriers of general information home is not very efficient so we've focused on developing an email list and a monthly or bimonthly postcard mailed home. Of course things like permission slips and special events that the students are motivated to get home and back to school are not a problem.
The postcard is usually a list of significant dates, deadlines, and reminders for families and students. Parental feedback has been positive and the postcards end up on the family fridge.
The email list has been a very powerful tool for involving, inviting, and reminding parents about school related things. Best of all, and sometimes worst of all, it allows parents to network with one another as well as with the school. I use the email list on a regular basis to ask for volunteers, donations, to remind parents about upcoming events, and to send out notices beyond the routine morning notices that everyone gets in their email each morning. It's been great for dealing with rumors and for sending out information about little and large emergencies. Used it during 9/11 and again when we headed off a bomb scare. When I need chaperones for dances I just put out a note on the email two weeks before the dance. I always have gotten 20 or more responses within a week...not unlike what happens when a question or a request is put out on the middleweb list.

Linda Emm wrote: And I think that must be the secret ingredient. We have to find real work for parents to do in our middle schools. THEN... the biggest obstacle... is how do we get them there???? I think their kids are conflicted about wanting their parents there.
Linda, that's a real insight -- actual things for parents to do in middle schools. That helps with role construction and with efficacy. And we want to find things that are different from what they did in elementary school (being room mothers, etc.)
A key job for parents at this age is to monitor and guide their children's career in school, to help them plan for the future (after high school) and steer them toward the courses they'll need to qualify for that future. So one role is to meet with -- who? advisor? guidance counselor? to check on what their kids' options are, what classes they need to take now to qualify for college prep classes in high school, to find out if they need extra help in any areas (and where they can get it), and so on. This is a role many parents are not prepared for -- they need information and encouragement and a school staff member they can connect to. This is especially important in a community like Miami, with a large immigrant population.
One way to find out about student attitudes toward their parents' involvement is to ask them. I've done some focus groups with middle grades students and their responses are very interesting. Almost always they say they don't want their parents to be involved in ways that make them feel like babies, but they DO want their parents to know what's going on at school. They want their parents to be able to intervene and help out if they get in trouble, are being treated unfairly, are in danger in any way. This role of monitoring their progress is one that students seem to accept.
Student-led conferences, showcasing student work (where students present their projects to an audience that includes parents), student support teams (teacher, advisor, parents, mentors), are practices that seem to be effective.
This is a key in all relationships so it makes sense that it would be so when it comes to parent/teacher-home/school relationships.
When I first proposed the parent team concept many teachers expressed concerns around trust, confidentiality, and professionalism. We had to have a discussion about what the concerns were, where they came from, and how issues would be addressed when and if they arose.
In the end it really came down to how much the staff trusted me to make sure they were protected from breaches in confidentiality and unfair attacks. Defining the parents' role in terms of the school's mission statement helped. Making sure that parent leaders understood and agreed with the role really helped. We have a good tradition of strong, supportive parent leaders who are advocates for the school's mission. In the past they've even stood up for the school when it was criticized by some negative parents in the local press. Of course trust is hard won and easily lost so I'm always on the watch for hidden agendas.
Chris Toy
Carolyn responded to Anne's original questions:
In my middle school, we have a student population about 1600, 6th-8th graders. Our parent organization might consist of 25-30 active volunteers. At no point in my two years at this school can I think of any collaboratory involvement of parents and teachers on a given project, unless it revolves around music or sports. I know this group meets once a month, but I cannot recall any teacher having been invited or if they have been no reports have been brought back to the faculty. Keep this in mind as the history of our building.
Last year we, meaning the faculty were given a gift that we underappreciated - a new assistant principal. She kept a fairly low profile in her first year, but wants to now bridge the gap between teachers and parents as well as teachers and administration. Her focus for parents is to get them involved in all aspects of the school. This coming year I will have the pleasure of working with her and other faculty on a parent laison committee to get our parents more involved.
I believe that all the points you raised in your questions on these two topics are extremely valid.
Anne wrote: What about feelings of efficacy? The academics in middle school are far more complex than in elementary school.

What are your schools doing to bolster families' confidence that they can help their children? What kinds of information and other messages are you conveying about how kids this age learn, what they are learning, and what parents can do to support them?
Yes, academics are harder in middle school. I know that I find it almost impossible to help my daughter in math any more (thank goodness her father is a math whiz). One way that I think teachers can help in this area is to ensure that information the students are learning is easy to comprehend, i.e. directions for assignments are understood, with student exemplars shown and discussed, rubrics for assessment, resources for meeting district guidelines,etc. are clear.
I would like to propose Parent Study Nights or something of the like. I know we discussed this on the list, having time for parents to come in and maybe learn what their kids are learning. Possibly sending home class newsletters and definitely a school newsletter. Getting the school internet webpage up and running and keeping it current. All of these could be ways to alleviate parent fears of ever stepping foot back in "that building" again.
Anne wrote: Then there's the question of invitation. Middle schools are usually bigger, farther away, and more complex in structure by far than elementary schools.

This is a biggee! I know that for a parent to get in touch with a teacher they either have to go through the front office to get the extension or know it before hand. OUr building has no direct dial out of classrooms, so parents must leave voicemail that we need to check more often. It is time consuming as we have to find certain phones that are not always readily available. For example on my floor alone there are 40 teachers and only 4 phones with outside calling. When we use our private cell phones to make calls to parents from within our classrooms we are reprimanded by admin. So it is not easy on either side for this type of communication to occur and can be quite frustrating.
I would love to have dialogue of other schools who have successful parent involvement to voice their programs in this forum so those of us who are just starting or are trying to repair years of neglect can learn.
Carolyn Beitzel
Bill Ivey offered an independent school perspective:
In terms of "role construction"... my experience as an educator is primarily with independent schools where almost by definition parents care about their children's learning - else why would they go to the time, trouble and expense of enrolling their children in the school in the first place? Where our experience dovetails with the larger educational community is understanding what the role involves. With their children at an age where they are seeking increased independence, and given that parents themselves also want to encourage and promote that independence, parents have a tough balancing act figuring out just how to remain involved without unintentionally stifling their children's development.
Which leads to "invitation" as parents at both of my schools are primarily invited to keep in contact with the school through their children's advisors. There is information in the Student Handbook to that effect, and administrators will frequently ask that parents with concerns contact the advisor first. I wrote letters to my advisees' parents, and gave them my phone and email and urged them to contact me whenever they had something extra-specially wonderful or a concern to share. Once they did, my manner in listening respectfully and responding to what they were saying determined whether or not they would continue to feel welcome. We had "Parents' Night" and two parent conference days scheduled each year, plus many parents came to attend athletic events, plus I frequently emailed or phoned or bumped into on campus and spoke to parents of all my advisees. Over time, a relationship evolved pretty naturally, and it worked out pretty well.
Which leads to "efficacy," and I do believe that parents who were involved in their children's education and/or athletic life almost all felt good about the experience - that they were able to work with the school to their children's best interest. Our PTG is another question altogether, as a small core of 5-15 parents did virtually all the work and we are struggling to eliminate the all-too-common attitude that the PTG is only for parents whose children receive financial aid. That's going to be a tough road.
I've been writing primarily about Pine Cobble, as that's where I have worked with middle grades kids, but much of what I have written applies to Stoneleigh-Burnham as well (which is high school level).
I am really intrigued - given Pine Cobble's historic difficulties with the PTG, and given my own bent toward meeting people on common ground - with Debbie's question about co-constructing parents' roles. I'm interested to hear what other schools do, and I'll keep brainstorming on my own as well.
Take care,
Bill Ivey
Bill -- Thanks for the detailed information on your good practices. I think having a well-designed advisory system is probably the single most important thing a middle school can do to engage parents. Even in large schools, it's possible to have real, human contact. Building personal relationships is critical to developing trust and collaboration, not to mention solving some of those pesky communication problems Chris Toy mentioned.
Is anyone out there at a public school with an effective advisory system? Could you describe how it works and if you think it makes a difference in building relationships with all your families?
Focus groups--now there's an idea. Perhaps a focus group to examine parent involvement and level of same--starting with a focus group of students, perhaps. Somehow getting the students to recruit parents might result in the parents' getting informed of meetings, etc.

I just interviewed Tony Smith of The Bay Area Coalition of Equitable Schools (BAYCES) about a project he's working with in Emeryville CA. As part of my background work for the piece I visited the website set up for the project. It was very inviting and user friendly. Here's the announcement:
BECOME AN ACADEMIC VOLUNTEER MENTOR
EMERY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND EMERYVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUSINESS EDUCATION COMMITTEE
ACADEMIC VOLUNTEER MENTOR PROGRAM
Support students in your community.
Kindergarten through 12th grade students need your help.
Make a difference in one child's life.
You can help if you are:
A mother, father, sister, brother, Grandparent, community member, business person or someone who cares.
You can be:
-- A tutor in math, reading, writing computers, etc.
-- A Role model (share your life experiences) -- A companion (spend time talking with your student friend)
-- A supporter (give support and encourage their efforts at home &amp; school)
-- A resource person (introduce youth to new people, places, interests, or ideas)
-- A teacher (show youth how to do things)
-- A challenger (give constructive guidance)
All you need is the willingness to give at least two hours a month. We'll set up all the rest
I thought this was a refreshing change from the usual list of possible roles. I've also been impressed with the material from the Child Development Studies Center that are called Homeside Activities. These activities are more than your usual homework and invite family participation without requiring English proficiency or a Master's degree.
Beverly wondered about parents as substitute teachers:
Chris Toy (and others) -- Do you recruit parents to substitute teach? Do teachers ever worry when a student's parent is subbing and might take a jaundiced view of the teacher's methods and management? (I mentioned the possibility of identifying some parents who might sub for members of my team last year and was quickly shot down). I think it would be lovely for a middle school team to have several parents they could count on to sub whenever a teacher was absent--would bring consistency and also some good PR since parents do talk...
Beverly Maddox Little Rock, AR
I do recruit parents to sub. They are held to the same standards as any employee...confidentiality. If it doesn't work, I don't call them back. Most parents who take the time to sub do a great job.
Chris Toy
At my school we used to have Family Math, Science &amp; Technology Nights that were well attended. we had 500 people, including students at our first event. We shared fun activities in each curricular area, had educational trinkets as gifts and served dinner. Families rotated through a roster of activities with 1/2 hour in each area. We did not allow any conversations of "problems" at these events. It was not a "gotcha", but it was an opening to feelings of partnership and learning together.
My school was 48% Latino with African-American, Asian, Arabic and Caucasian students making up the other 52% in smaller percentages.
I have been wondering if a service learning project run by kids about ways parents would like to be involved might be instructive...

This is a great idea. I wonder why your team was so opposed. Sounds like the trust level between teachers and parents isn't very high. Have you seen the new book by Tony Bryk, Trust in Schools? In his study of Chicago schools, he found that schools with high levels of what he calls "relational trust" tend have higher student performance. He surveyed school staff about mutual respect (able to voice concerns, genuine listening to each other), competence (colleagues are competent and work hard), personal regard (feeling supported and encouraged), and integrity (people keep their word, do what they say they will). Schools that with high teacher-teacher, principal-teacher, and teacher-parent trust were much more likely to be in the top quartile of performance.
What about initiating a discussion about trust at your school?
My principal doesn't seem very open to faculty ideas that don't come from an inner circle (My nose is definitely out of joint since I love being in the loop), so I may have to stage a coup during pre-school faculty meetings to explore all the ideas I've garnered this summer from here and other conversations on the subversive MIDDLEWEB network!! Holding a faculty conversation regarding trust among what my principal likes to call "All the stakeholders" would be a beginning. If not in full faculty meeting, at least within my team.
Next comes a discussion of the various roles parents can play. Expecting their participation to support the mission won't work unless we teachers are dead on about how OUR participation supports the mission--come to that, how does the principal support out mission?.....
I can see clearly that I need to start these discussions with my class of eighth graders. Fortunately, almost any discussion can be worked into a language arts lesson! From what I've experienced with faculty and committee meetings, my little nippers could design a parent outreach strategy and plan that would be more to the point and effective, too. Perhaps if they design it, the info would reach the parents, too....
If I could get the other team teachers to agree to show up for a night in late September to meet with parents....would they do that if the contract doesn't allow for that? Aye, there's the rub. . . .
Beverly Maddox
I think the idea of having a discussion around the roles of parents and teachers in helping students to be successful in school is a great, dare I say fantastic, idea.
Hey, throwing in the idea that it's supposed to address students, students should be included. I can envision an evening where parents, teachers, and students work separately and together to develop some agreements about what each will do to support success. Based on my experience there might be a healthy turnout for such an event. Maybe?
Beverly wrote: If I could get the other team teachers to agree to show up for a night in late September to meet with parents....would they do that if the contract doesn't allow for that? Aye, there's the rub. . . .
Sounds like you need to either get in the circle or get to the inner circle. I wonder what makes someone the inner circle. For me it is whoever is willing to approach me with ideas for addressing identified problems.
Any chance you could incorporate role definition and/or trust building in your Fall open house? Is there a Fall open house?

Deborah Bambino wrote: At my school we used to have Family Math, Science &amp; Technology Nights that were well attended. we had 500 people, including students at our first event.
So did they accomplish their intent? Are they in the past? It sure seems that they were popular.
Chris Toy
I'm no longer at the school, but I think/hope they are still being held.
Debbie talked about "real work" for parents.
My buddy, Linda Emm, talked about getting parents involved in real work. One of the ways to do this is to actually start Looking at Student Work (LASW) with parents. I'm not talking about a program we're trying to teach them, I'm referring to small groups who actually examine a sample of work and describe what they see, what they don't see, what they wonder about etc. Having a facilitator and a protocol, or structured approach to the examination and discussion about student work is an extremely powerful experience. Parents will be able to add new layers of understanding that will inform our plans to improve our instruction and assignments. (No student or teacher names would be left on the work to protect privacy.)
Actually sharing our ongoing questions about instruction might go a long way toward building trust and demystifying what it means to be able to help kids learn. Just a thought...
I think that must be the secret ingedient. We have to find real work for parents to do in our middle schools. THEN... the biggest obstacle... is how do we get them there????
When I taught sixth grade a number of years ago, our team did an "Africa Project" which was a precursor to the multiple intelligences. We just didn't call it that. Our team leader at the time was very progressive and a risk taker. Anyway, we created about twelve different projects that were writing, or art, or music, etc. Then since the entire team was involved, we sent a notice home to parents detailing the project, and asked if they were interested in helping out. We scheduled a meeting for six pm and about twenty parents showed up. We involved them in the real work of working with different groups of students over the next few weeks. One couple even brought in some sewing machines so the kids could sew flags!
So, the lesson I took from that was to make it team oriented at first. It got people in the door, they helped the kids, although not particularly their own kids, was curriculum-oriented and was real work. They were engaged! At the end, they attended an evening banquet that the kids had helped make themselves.

One frustration that arose for me (inner-city, high poverty area) was that parents did not work traditional 9-5 jobs; many worked two jobs, or night jobs, or cared for many young children all day/night - all situations which made it very difficult for them to come to school for anything at any time of day. With a school pop. of 175, on parent night we didn't get more that 1/10 of the parents there. There were also language barrier issues. I would love to hear some creative and effective ways to help get parents more involved in childrens life at school.
Meg Krause
There is an old saying &amp;shyp; "if there is food, then they will come!" Seriously though, why not try a night of food and fun where you provide a sit down style pot luck dinner, and talk to the parents about the school? Then let the parents and/ or students get in groups and discuss how they want to help and start up some committees. Have people sign up to volunteer time or contribute to the school. Finally the students could do a short presentation/ skit/ band or choir etc. to round off the night?
Nicole Foster
One of my colleagues used to suggest that we walk the neighborhood and hand out flyers for Back to School Night. It never got sufficient support, but I always thought it was a good idea. I've also heard suggestions that meetings be held at Community Centers, Libraries or Churches instead of always at the school. Whether we like it or not, the school isn't always a welcoming place for the parents we are most anxious to reach.
Finally, I had some friends in Lancaster who made home visits to all the kids in their Small Learning Community before school started. They felt it really got them off to a good start last year and made a statement to the community about their desire to form a real partnership.
Have any of you ever done home visits?
When I was a new assistant principal at a high school I went around the neighborhood and introduced myself. I let neighbors know that they could call the school if they had any concerns about our students. It seemed to work since I did get calls when concerns arose.
As principal I did attend some parent meetings in various neighborhoods, usually upper middle class homes.
Chris Toy
We did home visits in my "home" district and found them successful, but I think it was the one on one nature of the visits that made them so special. Visiting in the home did not sit well with some parents, so we have resorted to scheduling at home, school or an alternate location. Teams generally split up the visits among advisories. Unfortunately, this is an entry level activity... first and sixth grades respectively.
Another very successful parent involvement activity done in our intrgrated 7th and 8th grade classes are periodic "back to school" nights throughout the year. They are focused on student exhibitions of work.
Finally, I agree with who ever suggested that "content" related meetings bring the parents out. My most well attended PTA meeting as president invited parents to come hear a presentation given to the students by an outside speakers bureau. The idea to invite the parents to have the "experience" came from the students. The content was on "sex, drugs and rock 'n roll". It let the parents in on some of the challenges their children are facing and some of the misconceptions they hold as truths. Having the parents and students experience the same presentation left the door wide open for discussion at home. (In case you're wondering, neither group was ready to hear the stuff together!)
A colleague of mine firmly believes in actively recruiting parent volunteers...in person rather than through flyers. She sets up tables at school-wide events and has her board actively approach parents. Have any of you tried asking folk, in person, to participate?
Chris Kingsbery
John asked about principal leadership.
Chris Toy wrote: "When I first proposed the parent team concept many teachers expressed concerns around trust, confidentiality, and professionalism. We had to have a discussion about what the concerns were, where they came from, and how issues would be addressed when and if they arose. In the end it really came down to how much the staff trusted me to make sure they were protected from breaches in confidentiality and unfair attacks."
There's an important insight lurking here in Chris's comments.
What's the role of the principal in bringing about parent partnerships?
The schools I've visited and written about that had strong parent components (I'm thinking, for example, of Conway Middle in Louisville, Anne) had a principal who led the faculty to new ways of thinking about parents' roles in the school.
Any thoughts about the principal piece of this?
John Norton
Cossondra asked about inner and outer circles of faculty.
Several recent posts have commented on the idea of the school climate with the "inner circle" of staff and the "outer circle" of staff. I find this whole idea intriguing and wonder what creates these situations.
We have developed a definite inner and outer circle among our staff with the "inner circle" being made of those (like Chris said..) who are willing to approach the administration with ideas and concerns and hash things out until a compromise is met. Our outer circle is comprised of the negative nay-sayers on staff who would rather sneak off in the corner to complain and gossip rather than dealing with the problems up front and out in the open. Even when members of the "inner circle" try to include these folks, and several of us have on multiple occasions, they seem to prefer those same mode of operation.
It is frustrating to hear these folks complain about the principal, who is a very easy to talk to person, open to our ideas, honest about his opinion, supportive of our decisions and determine to maintain as much teacher autonomy as possible. It is equally as frustrating to intentionally go to them to ask for help or advice and they consistently choose to remain outside the loop, answering "It really isn't my place to say" or "I don't think that is a decision to be made by teachers" and such when we are discussing new curriculum, schedules, discipline procedures, field trips, etc...... seriously.... any topic! They do not want to give input, they just want to complain that their input is not valued. They are the ones like someone else mentioned, who would never agree to an open house because it is "outside the contract" and fight things like field trips or planning time outside of school.
THese are some new teachers, some old foggies... but the "outers" bring the "inners" down - at least to some extent. How can we start the school year with a new leaf and change our climate? I honestly feel badly about leaving them out of the loop but what else can be done?
Cossondra George
Anne also asked about principal leadership.
Many of the concerns expressed today were from teachers in schools that were not particularly hospitable to families. A single concerned teacher can do only so much in such a climate. The role of the principal is critical. Chris Toy has made that abundantly clear.
I repeat John's question: what is the role of the principal in opening up a school to families? In reaching out to families and the community?
For example, Debbie mentioned the effectiveness of home visits. It's an old practice, but very effective -- in making a connection, building a relationship, giving a new perspective on a student, bonding with the student (even in middle school). It's hard to imagine a school where a teacher or two would take this on through their own initiative and then have it catch on. A lot of issues need to be worked through, and that takes leadership.
As an external coach working with schools I have had the opportunity recently to help design retreats where mixed teams of staff, administration, students and parents have attended. The administration has been the key in welcoming and recruiting family members. The presence of parents and students has made some staff members a little nervous initially, but once the real work has begun, it's like magic!
The ideal graduate activity that I've mentioned before on the list was a good way to get everyone "envisioning" student success together. Once we had the conversations about what we wanted for our children, we were good to go with planning ways to achieve our goals.
I agree that the principals played a critical role in ensuring a place for parental and student voice.
I fully agree that you need to have admin support for whatever endeavors teachers tackle. If you cannot get support from above you probably are just spinning wheels.
This year we are lucky at our school to have an asst principal who wants to make parent involvement a priority. We shall see what happens with this initiative.
Carolyn Beitzel
I think the principal has a number of roles when it comes to opening up a school to the community. One is to set an example for others to see and learn from. Another role is to support teachers, parents, students, and community members who model open and positive communication. A third role would be to advocate for open, positive, and safe interaction for everyone.
Chris Toy
Debbie wrote: "My buddy, Linda Emm, talked about getting parents involved in real work. One of the ways to do this is to actually start Looking at Student Work (LASW) with parents."
Several years ago I wrote about a school where this was done - in fact, it's a school both Anne H and I are familiar with...Conway MS in Louisville.
A planning team of teachers and parents came up with the strategy. They took a released item from the state science test, having to do with scientific method, and had every student in the school work through the item (gr 6-8). On a staff development day, parents were invited to join teachers in small groups in the cafeteria for a LASW session, looking at the student work on the item. Every effort was made to keep the items anonymous. ALL the teachers participated, not just science teachers, so there were parent AND teacher "non-experts" at each table. They used a rubric and an LASW protocol. About 30 parents participated. This was one of the faculty's first experiences with LASW, too, and there were lots of "aha's" among the parents and the teachers. Parents said they came away with a much clearer idea of what it meant to view student work from a standards/mastery point of view.
Cossondra wrote about faculty resistance and John replied:
I've mentioned these before on MWLIST, but here are two of my favorite short articles about resistance...
More recently, an article appeared in the KAPPAN that examined the effects of America's tradition of independence and resistance to authority on school culture.
We started parent socials at our high school a few years back and it was a success. It brought together parents who branch off to support their children's interest groups i.e. booster clubs. It gives us a feeling of being a class.
Chris Kingsbery
How were these socials set up? I'm not quite sure I know what a "social" would be in a school context.
The socials are a way to bring parents together to meet those they might not meet otherwise. They are held at school or another venue...fols pitch in food and drink and the conversation is around school related stuff. It's not intended to be a business meeting...just an opportunity to gather as a school community.
Chris K
Anne Henderson summed up the first day of conversation.
Wow -- what a wonderful outpouring, and it went on well into the evening! I really appreciate all the thoughtful, honest, and insightful comments and ideas you shared. As I work on the Beyond the Bake Sale update, I may be contacting some of you for permission to use your ideas or to get more information.
I'd like to sum up some of the main themes we discussed, then pose another, related area for our conversation today.
We really explored the idea of role construction:
- having structured conversations or focus groups with mixed groups of parents and teachers to discuss their expectations of each other and how they would like to work together. Chris Toy suggested adding to students to the mix -- great idea.
- asking students to design a parent outreach program (I loved this one)
- using the team structure to engage parents and giving them specific roles to play
- facilitated discussions on various issues, like cross-generational communication
- having transition nights to explain the middle school structure and program, opportunities for parents to be engaged
- retreats with parents, teachers, students and administrators
- developing a "job description" for parents (school-family compact)
We also talked about the value of "the personal touch" -- meeting face-to-face and one-on-one, to build a relationship, get to know each other (thanks to Carolyn Beitzel and Beverly Maddox for their contributions on this)
- home visits
- personal phone calls
- setting up a table at open house to recruit volunteers
- an advisory system
- class dinners that students prepare and invite their families to attend
- offering food and having social get-togethers rather than business meetings
- having meetings in families homes and places in the community, rather than at the school
Link to content - This is important, because the research is clear that parent activities that have some academic content are more effective in improving student achievement (duh) (thanks, Debbie)
- Inviting guest speakers on topics of interest to families
- Looking at student work (LASW) in all kinds of settings, including periodic back to school nights that focus on different subjects
- parent study nights
- recruiting parents as substitute teachers
- Family math/science/technology nights
- Projects with themes, such as the Africa Project that Jack Wallace described, that give families a resource role
And, of course, the importance of principal leadership. Chris Toy was very helpful with all his input
- How to mediate between "in" and "out" groups of teachers (and avoid having that situation in the first place)
- The role of the principal: to be a model, set expectations and tone of openness, support teachers and staff to reach out to families, create a climate of open, honest interaction
- The need to build trust in the school community, and to have open discussions about problems or initiatives where trust is an issue (like parent substitutes, or involving parents in teams)
Today, I'd like to drill even deeper into some of the more uncomfortable aspects of working with families: class and cultural differences.
Annette Lareau's work on this issue is marvelous -- one of her studies is summarized in A New Wave of Evidence . Let's face it, everyone who teaches in a school is an English-speaking, college-educated middle class professional. Most of the families sending kids to public schools are not middle class and many may not have a high school diploma or speak English at all. This can set up a situation where conversations are awkward, stereotypes prevail, and mutual understanding is limited.
Do you feel that teachers are less comfortable building relationships with parents outside of their own class? Do they tend to make more connections, for example, with middle class parents when they're in a mixed school?
The corollary question almost doesn't need asking: are teachers less comfortable with parents outside their own cultural and language group? What helps to bridge this divide?
And for teachers in high-poverty schools, is there a class barrier between teachers and parents that gets in the way of building partnership, even when their cultural background is the same?
Your last question hit home for me. I'm in the midst of working to set up a parent literacy center in a high poverty school...something the school has been working toward for two years.
I am baffled by the roadblocks they set up for themselves and the initiative.
The proposal is to have the center on the third floor of a building that has an empty wing on the first floor. Go figure?
Lack of funding for computers has been a recurring roadblock despite my encouragement to get the room and idea up and running.
I wonder if they really want the center to open or if they thought the language would insure their grant money. Or if maybe the "class" thing is getting in the way.
Have any of you experienced similar silent but deadly resistence?
Chris K
Chris -- Who is setting up these roadblocks? The administrators at the school? The planning team for the project? Who is pushing for the project and where is the resistance coming from? What is your analysis of what is going on?
A quick read of your message makes me think that whoever is planning this (aside from you, of course) is not culturally sensitive. Exhibit #1: the project is slated for a third floor spot when the first floor is empty. (great observation, very telling)
Was the question about class and cultural differences too challenging? My email box is almost empty.....
I don't think so. I think it's Friday in the summer, the weekend before many of us start back to work.
I believe the school/community coordinator who is in charge of the project has set it up to fail and I don't understand why. She is a neighbor, has spent 27 years in the school and has the title to make it happen, yet whenever I suggest we clean out the room, look for furniture, establish a library, collect parent resources...she says all they want is computers. I think computers will be a great addition, but let's first establish this resource, connect the neighborhood to it and continue to work on resources over time. But so far all we have is a designated room, yes, on the third floor...as far from the office as is physically possible...filled with junk!
I have suggested establishing a committee to move the process along, but to no avail so far...I just wonder if their is a cultural barrier I'm not grasping. Any thoughts?
Also, on another note...I am teaching a part of a graduate "issues for middle level teachers" class this fall. My section is on parent /community partnerships and how to establish and sustain these. I have some resources and thoughts...I ordered the new study you suggested as a possible text, any other thoughts...oh my part of the class has 8 hours of instructional time over four weeks.
Love to hear your thoughts,
Chris K
Hi Chris Kingsbury, Chris Toy here. I wonder if there are some supportive parents who might help to get the literacy center off the ground? I wonder why the third floor if the first floor is empty?
Debbie wrote about roadblocks.
I think the questions you raised are right on the money, but are rarely acknowledged or discussed. Sorry for not writing earlier, but I was a helper today at the day camp where my youngest is working this summer.
In my experience, teachers go into teaching with high ideals and hope to do good. They are totally unprepared when their efforts are suspect, or they feel resented. Most teacher prep programs barely acknowledge the existence of differences let alone problems vis a vis class and race. Many new urban teachers find themselves in poor communities where they are often in a distinct minority, racially and socio-economically. This situation is a recipe for misunderstanding.
Because I became a teacher in my mid thirties, I had the advantage of having felt the class bias of many school personnel toward blue collar parents. When a group of us asked questions about content and program at our childrens' school, our motives were suspect. We were treated like we had some nerve questioning professionals. Teachers may resent being questioned by middle class parents, but it's usually not blatant.
As a teacher, I have also felt the sting of remarks in faculty rooms when teachers talk about the age of our students' parents, assuming that all young parents are negligent. I had teenage parents. Any assumption that I was neglected would have been wrong, but it would have been painful.
When parents, based on their experiences, encourage their children to stand up for themselves and fight back, they are written off as barbaric. I was taught to fight back as a child. A little investigation and trust building would go a long way in this area.
I have heard colleagues make fun of childrens' names questioning why they should be burdened with having to pronounce or spell such "foreign" names. This example speaks volumes to me. If I can't be bothered to respect your name, or your child's name, how can you expect me to respect you?
I'll stop here, but I know that I have to continually reflect on my practice toward others who are different from me to make sure that I am not making assumptions , or devaluing their experience in any way. If as faculties we don't even acknowkedge the possibility that difference is an issue, or that we might be biased, I don't see how we can build partnerships or trust with our students and their families.
Anne responded to Chris K's query about resources
There are lots of good resources on this out there. How are you going to focus your section? So much to cover, so little time. I thought that starting with the Hoover-Dempsey study yesterday yielded a lot of good discussion, for example. It's important to get to the tough issues fairly quickly, I think. Assess their attitudes -- do they really think all parents care about their children and want to help them succeed in school? Bryk's survey on teacher-parent trust (he didn't survey parents) yielded this:
No Trust: Teachers feel they get little or no respect from parents and believe that talking with parents does not help them understand students better. They perceive very little support from parents, and feel there is a lot of conflict between parents and teachers. They also report that few teachers really care about the school community.
Minimal Trust: Teachers feel respected by (and respect for) parents, to some extent. They agree that talking with parents helps their efforts, but feel parents give them little support at home. Only some teachers agree that parents are partners in educating their children.
Strong Trust: Teachers report a lot of respect between parents and teachers. They feel that talking with parents is helpful, and that about half the families support their teaching at home. About half of teachers care about the community and feel good about parent support.
Very Strong Trust: Almost all teachers feel great respect by and for parents and report no conflict between parents and teachers. They see parents are partners in education and feel good about the amount of support they receive. They all feel that nearly all teachers care about the school community.
I tried to attach a summary of Annette Lareau's study on class/cultural differences -- lots of meat there for interesting discussions -- but the server wouldn't let me do it. I'll send it to your personal email address. If others want it, maybe John can figure out how to send it to you. The same summary appears in A New Wave of Evidence .
I hope you keep us posted on how your course goes.
Debbie suggested a resource list.
I was wondering if we might generate a resource list of things we've used effectively in our partnering with parents and families...any takers?
While I appreciate conversations around the need to build trust, define roles etc, I find myself worrying that we not get caught up in admiring the problem without getting down to the nitty gritty of how to change our practice.
Deborah Bambino writes: I find myself worrying that we not get caught up in admiring the problem without getting down to the nitty gritty of how to change our practice.
Good point Debbie. I'd say a good first to changing practice is to do some kind of assessment of what exists. I'd hesitate to do a general survey. My experience is that folks who reply to surveys tend to be either very unhappy or very supportive. So perhaps putting together a focus group to examine what's working well and what needs to improve would be a way to begin.
I've said it before...and I'll say it again, Taking what works in your school's organizational structure and extending it to encompass families and the community is something to look at doing. Of course if what is happening in the school isn't working well...
Chris Toy
Carolyn responded to Anne's question about relationships across class boundaries.
Anne wrote: "Do you feel that teachers are less comfortable building relationships with parents outside of their own class? Do they tend to make more connections, for example, with middle class parents when they're in a mixed school?"
This is hard to answer. I can surmise from what I see around me, but can only answer to myself. So...In my building your statement about educated, middle class professionals as teachers is true. Even though our school is culturally diverse (68 different countries represented) there are only two teachers of color. Our faculty is also one of many years of experiences. That is good and bad. Many have developed comfortable trenches and are leary and unwilling to peak over the edge. I really think there is an us and them mentality. In the last two years new hires were in the upper teens in numbers. This is my third year there and surprisingly to me, this year we have less than 10 coming in and everyone who was hired last year has stayed! I believe the culture of our building is changing, but it is really hard. I envision in another 5 years when many retire, those of us who are committed will be able to make positive change. I digress..
I see teachers in my building not want to involve themselves with parents. I think it does relate to class/culture. Unless you can understand the trials of someone else's life you cannot be open to developing relationships that work for both sides. After reflection, I know that I am part of that problem as well. I don't want to be, but it is very easy to fall into the pattern of blaming the parents for the ills of the child. I would never think NOT to get involved in the educational process of my daughter so it is sometimes hard to understand why every parent does not feel the same way.
The corollary question almost doesn't need asking: are teachers less comfortable with parents outside their own cultural and language group? What helps to bridge this divide?
I would say yes. Anything of the unknown makes individual's uncomfortable. However, there are people who take this feeling and say to themselves "okay, now how can I lesson my discomfort?" and there are others who say "I hate this" and turn away. Is one a better teacher/person than another? I know for myself, I am very hesitant in any new situation of meeting people to put myself out there. It is something that has been hard for me and I try to overcome it by just "doing it." So put into the mix, for me, of being different in some way and it is even more hard.
I think to bridge the divide, you have to place yourself in situations and learn from the experience. We have a security guard who is African American. I really like her alot. She is funny and no nonsense at the same time. We had many conversations last year about race and color and how we treat our children differently, but we love them the same. I think it boils down to the idea that I as the teacher and you as the parent have the same goal in mind - to teach the child.
And for teachers in high-poverty schools, is there a class barrier between teachers and parents that gets in the way of building partnership, even when their cultural background is the same?
Again, I think the answer is yes. I would like to think that teachers, according to the profession, even though we all hold personal opinions, would remain open to new ideas and experiences and to learn from others, their mistakes and their successes.
Boy, these are thought provoking questions, Anne. I went to grad school at the Univ of Penn where our professors were very much interested in teaching us about cultural diversity and the idea of race/class/culture/color in the classroom. We read many experts in the area of this type of research. I was exposed to this level of thinking, but I am not sure how many others have been. What I take for granted just because of the color of my skin is mindboggling. I can dig up some pieces if you or anyone else is interested.

I would be interested in any resources you found helpful. I just realized that you are in Upper Darby. I spent three days at Upper Darby High in late June. I was working with the staff on Critical Friends practices around reflection, collaboration, team building etc. I go back on August 25th for a final day.
Thank you for your honest sharing around this important but thorny topic. I think if we could get the conversation going in our varied contexts, it would be a huge first step.
Thanks, Debbie
Chris Toy summed up his feeling on culture and class.
As the only adult of color in my school...come to think of it...in the school system, I would have to say that culture and class matter a lot. I'd generalize it to say that differences matter and need to be recognized, respected, and considered when we interact with families. This is difficult to do while we are trying to get our "work" done.
I think it's also hard to understand things like prejudice, racism, sexism, ageism, social stratification and other forms of intolerance when one has not been the target of those things.
I would like to think that, paying attention to these things in the context of a culture of thoughtfulness and acceptance of differences as well as an examination of commonalities will create a climate that reduces intolerance.
I took a weeklong workshop on mediation recently. One of the participants who runs and outreach program for people waiting in deathrow passed on something that seems to fit here. It's from a Sufi poet.
"Out beyond rightdoing and wrongdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there."
I think it sums up how I feel about this issue.

John closed the chat Friday evening:
This was a great conversation, with lots of ideas flowing to and fro!
In the middle of day one, Chris K. wrote me a note asking if there would be a digest because he wanted to archive all this great stuff. There is a digest and I'll be happy to send the two-plus-a-bit days to anyone who writes to me privately.
Anne, we REALLY appreciate the time you've devoted to this chat. You've already let me know privately that you got some great ideas for your revision of "Beyond the Bake Sale" so I feel sure we all benefited in some way.
NOTE TO READERS: We are planning a follow-up discussion in early Fall, taking as our guide the points made by Debbie, Anne and others about moving beyond a discussion of the problem toward possible solutions.
