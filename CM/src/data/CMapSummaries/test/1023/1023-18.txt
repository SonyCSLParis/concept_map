Anti-Bullying Policy
We are committed to providing a caring, friendly and safe environment for all our students so they can learn in a relaxed and secure atmosphere. Bullying of any kind is unacceptable at our school. We are a telling school. This means that anyone who knows that bullying is happening is expected to tell the staff. Challenging bullying effectively will show that we care and make clear to bullies that the behaviour is unacceptable. Bullying hurts. No one deserves to be a victim; everyone has the right to be treated with respect.
WHAT IS BULLYING?
Bullying is aggressive or insulting behaviour by an individual or group, often repeated over a period of time, that intentionally hurts or harms. This can have a destructive effect on young people's lives. Although some can shrug it off, bullying can produce feelings of powerlessness, isolation from others, undermine self-esteem and sometimes convince the victims that they are at fault. It can affect attitudes to and performance in school. For some it can lead to prolonged distress and long-term damage to social and emotional development. All staff, pupils and parents need to be aware of the negative and damaging effect that bullying can have on individuals, and the school in general, and should work towards ensuring that it is eliminated as far as is practicable. Bullying can be:
Physical - hitting, kicking, punching, taking belongings
Verbal - name calling, spreading rumours, sarcasm, insulting
Emotional - being unfriendly, excluding others, tormenting
Racist - racial taunts, graffiti
Sexual - unwanted physical contact, sexually abusive comments, focusing on sexuality
Cyber-bullying - defined as the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), particularly mobile devices and the Internet, deliberately to upset someone else. Because cyber-bullying differs in several significant ways from other kinds of bullying, and the potential for its increase will grow with the development and use of technology, our treatment of it is explained in a specific section of this policy.
Cyberbullying is a sub-set or 'method' of bullying. It can be used to carry out all the different 'types' of bullying (such as racist bullying, homophobic bullying, or bullying related to SEN and disabilities), but instead of the perpetrator carrying out the bullying in person, they use technology as a means of conducting the bullying. Cyberbullying can include a wide range of unacceptable behaviours, including harassment, threats and insults, and like face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying is designed to cause distress and harm.
It differs significantly from other forms of bullying, e.g. the invasion of home/personal space, the difficulty in controlling electronically circulated messages, and even in the profile of the bully and target. Our policy applies equally to the cyber-bullying of school staff as to pupils.
1. We recognise that engagement with technology is a social activity of great importance to young people, so our policy is designed to support a sense of e- safety and e-responsibility that gives students the confidence to deal with any problems that may arise, whether in or out of school.
2. We recognise that cyber-bullying can take many forms:
threats and intimidation;
harassment or stalking;
vilification or defamation;
ostracising/peer rejection/exclusion
identity theft, unauthorised access and impersonation
publicly posting, sending or forwarding personal or private information or images
3. The impact of cyber-bullying can be greater than other forms because a larger audience can be reached rapidly, so a single incident may have long-term consequences.
4. Bystanders to cyber-bullying can easily become perpetrators - by passing on the harmful material deliberately or unintentionally. We take seriously the responsibility of these 'accessories' to bullying and will apply sanctions for such behaviour.
5. Cyberbullying can take place at any time and can intrude into spaces that might previously have been regarded as safe or personal. Schools have powers to discipline and regulate the behaviour of pupils, even when they are off the school site, and we will take measures to protect students whose education or wellbeing may be affected by cyber-bullying, irrespective of the location of the bully at the time of the action.
6. We will ensure that young people understand the value of preserving evidence of cyber-bullying so that they have the confidence to report it, and information on which we and other agencies might act to deal with it.
7. We will continue to promote students' understanding of e-safety and e-responsibility through the school's Acceptable Use Policy, and through the curriculum in IT and PSHCE. Students will be made aware that cyber-bullying may constitute a criminal offence.
8. Staff and peer mentors will receive specific training to deal with cases of cyber-bullying.
9. Incidents of cyber-bullying will be recorded on eportal.
10. We will provide support for victims of cyber-bullying by:
Giving advice on online empowerment
Trying to contain the incident
Providing support to prevent recurrence
11. We will investigate incidents of cyber-bullying to identify the perpetrator(s), then apply sanctions described above in the anti-bullying policy, and in line with our behaviour policy.
AIMS OF THIS POLICY The aims of this policy are:
To demonstrate that the school takes bullying seriously and that it will not be tolerated;
To take measures to prevent all forms of bullying and protect those who might be bullied;
To secure the active involvement of all staff, pupils and parents to combat bullying;
To support everyone in the actions to identify and protect those who might be bullied;
To demonstrate to all that the safety and happiness of pupils is enhanced by dealing positively with bullying.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES The specific objectives are:
The school will consistently challenge the culture that accepts bullying as part of life,
Form tutors and pastoral leaders within school will reinforce on a daily basis the school's ethos and expectations regarding attitude and behaviour;
The school staff will work pro-actively to establish a positive approach to and encourage confident relationships between staff and pupils and among pupils so that the pupils themselves can make a positive contribution;
The school staff, from the Headteacher down, will be aware of the importance of keeping the level of attention high, where bullying is concerned, making the policy work on a day-to-day basis, rather than only when serious incidents come to light;
Guidance and training will be provided to raise staff awareness, before re-visiting the policy and strengthening procedures;
School will continue to take full account of pupils' views via House and School Councils as well as dedicating curriculum and tutorial time to discussing relationships and matters such as bullying;
The school will have sound procedures for the reporting and prompt investigation of indications or allegations of bullying, and will spend whatever time is necessary to investigate concerns when they arise, and communicate with parents in this process;
All instances of bullying reported will be recorded on the CMIS record system so that all staff, but in particular the Headteacher and the designated teacher responsible for child protection, are kept fully informed so that analysis of patterns can inform both policy and practice;
Follow up action to ensure that the confidence of bullying victims is restored, and hopefully to ensure that the bullying does not re-occur will be comprehensive. As well as providing effective support for the victims, the behaviour of the bullies will be challenged and modified in line with the ethos and culture of the school;
School will emphasise to students that a culture of "not telling tales" or "grassing up" fosters bullying. We will make it clear to pupils that:-
The school's aims mean that any kind of harassment will not be tolerated;
Pupils, parents and staff need to understand what is meant by bullying and to report incidents of it;
There are systems for pupils to report bullying that minimise the risk of making things worse;
All allegations of bullying are investigated and, if confirmed, they are acted upon, with clear procedures and sanctions specified and applied consistently;
Records of incidents and the outcomes of investigations are used to inform review and planning by staff and governors;
The means of supporting victims of bullying include the involvement of their peers;
There are procedures to punish the bully but also to make sure that the behaviour is not repeated;
The PHSCE curriculum includes programmes that build self-esteem, self-confidence and responsible assertiveness;
The aim of in-service training is to refresh staff understanding of how to manage behaviour generally and to detect and respond to bullying, and this training covers staff new to the school.
KEY PERSONNEL
It is the responsibility of the Headteacher to ensure that policy and procedures are in place in school to deal with bullying, and that a senior member of staff (the designated teacher) is responsible for implementation, monitoring and review.
It is the responsibility of the designated teacher to ensure that staff are fully conversant with the school's stance on bullying and are putting policy into practice. The designated teacher will also be responsible for the monitoring and review of the anti-bullying policy in the light of consultation with senior colleagues.
It is the responsibility of the designated governor to liase with the Headteacher and designated teacher to monitor the incidence of bullying in the school and the effectiveness of the policy, and inform the relevant committee of the governing body as necessary.
It is the responsibility of the Senior Pastoral staff i.e. Head and deputy heads of House and Year to work with colleagues both pro-actively and reactively to ensure that instances of bullying in school are kept to a minimum and dealt with in accordance with school policy.
It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that every child in school has the right to be able to learn in a safe and stable environment free from physical, verbal, or any other sort of bullying.
PROCEDURES School will:
Maintain the momentum on action against bullying through continued initiatives to improve attitudes and behaviour;
