What Is Bullying?
Bullying happens when individuals or group of people continues to hurt, frighten, threaten, or exclude another person on purpose. It's often a repeated activity, with a particular child singled out over and over again.
Bullying involves an imbalance of power, where the child who bullies has more power (due to factors like age, size, or higher social status) than the targeted child.
There's not just one profile of a child who is bullied-any child can be singled out for any reason.
