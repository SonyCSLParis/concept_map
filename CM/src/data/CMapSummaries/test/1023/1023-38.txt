Easier - A bully is someone who is mean and attacks other people with words or actions. They use teasing, threats, or strength to pick on, frighten, or hurt someone or take what they want.
Harder - Bullying is a form of aggressive and harassing behavior. This antisocial behavior occurs across geographic, racial, and socioeconomic segments of society. Bullying prevents its targets from enjoying a safe, stress-free living, learning, and working environment. Children who bully are at risk for a host of long term, negative developmental outcomes including juvenile and adult criminal behavior. Early intervention in the home, school, and the community are the best hope we have of diverting people from this destructive pattern.

Bullying among children and teenagers has often been dismissed as a normal part of growing up. Little attention has been paid to the devastating effects of bullying, or to the connection between bullying and other forms of violence. In recent years, however, students and adults around the country have begun to make a commitment to stop bullying in their schools and communities.
