Can Stress Lead To Cheating?
As a mother of two boys, I'm all too aware of the impossibly high standards our children face in the academic world right now. Colleges are increasingly difficult to get into (not to mention expensive!), homework seems to have at least doubled compared to when I was a kid, and standardized tests are both a primary measure of how our children are doing in school, and a driving force behind what they learn. The general trend that I've seen in education is toward a more serious focus on grades, competition, and tests, which has led to greater stress among teachers and students.  And this, apparently, has lead to an increase in cheating.
According to Eric Anderman, a recognized expert on student cheating and professor of educational policy and leadership at Ohio State University, there's no doubt that cheating among students is widespread and has been growing. In some studies, up to 80 percent of high-achieving high school students and 75 percent of college students admit to cheating, a percentage that has been rising the past 50 years. In one study, Anderman and his colleagues found that 21 percent of students who say that cheating is "unacceptable" still engage in cheating behaviors. "What we know for sure is that students cheat a lot,"  Anderman said in a press release . "Parents don't think their kids will do it, but many do. I've seen that in my research, and also in the time I spent as a teacher." Studies have shown that boys, impulsive students, and those with 'type A' personalities are the most likely to cheat. Also, cheating goes up progressively as students transition to upper grade levels. During those transitions, teachers start changing how they talk to students. While earlier in school, teachers emphasize how learning is fun, as students get older teachers begin saying things like 'Now it's serious. Your grades matter.' That's directly related to cheating," Anderman said. "Research has consistently shown that cheating is more likely to occur in classrooms that focus on performance: getting the best possible grades, doing the best on tests. This produces anxiety and stress in both teachers and students, and that's what leads to cheating," says Anderman. Conversely, cheating is less likely to occur when the goal for students is 'personal mastery'  of the material; in other words, learning and understanding what is being taught. Ironically, students may actually do better if the focus in classrooms was on personal mastery and not on the tests. Students will learn better, remember the material longer, cheat less, and still do just as well, if not better, when they do standardized testing, according to Anderman. So what does this mean for you? That depends on the role you play.
If you're a teacher, it can mean that you can motivate your students to excel at the tests by shifting your focus away from the test, and back on the learning, creating a learning environment that's more enjoyable for yourself and your students, without worrying that their scores will suffer.  (It also arms you with information to take to your principal, if you need more support in doing this.)  Similarly, if you're a homeschooling family, this can also help inform your choices as you instruct your children.
If you're a parent of a school-age child, you, too, can help reduce stress in your child by taking some of the focus off of grades and test scores.  Yes, these things are important, but focusing more on the information that's being learned, and how that knowledge can relate to one's life, can help shift the focus away from the tests (and help reduce test anxiety) without grades suffering.  Also, if you reward good grades (as most parents do), it may be a good idea to try and shift the focus to rewarding effort instead, or to doing activities at home that reinforce learning whenever possible.  Helping them study for tests and being involved in their education and homework whenever possible can bring positive associations and make learning more enjoyable, and less anxiety-provoking.
Finally, having a few stress management strategies handy, and teaching them to your kids, is always a good idea. This will help not only with test taking (by reducing test anxiety), but with living a healthier lifestyle overall.
