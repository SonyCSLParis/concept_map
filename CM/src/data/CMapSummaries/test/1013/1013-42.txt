About Montessori
Early in the twentieth century, Maria Montessori developed educational materials and methods based on years of her research, which showed that children learn best by doing, not by passively accepting other people's ideas and pre-existing knowledge. The Montessori Method is dynamic in that observation and the meeting of needs is continual and specific for each child. The power of the Montessori teaching approach has been proven by modern research to enhance performance, interest, persistence, memory, and creativity in learning.
While many aspects of the Montessori method have now been incorporated into teaching programs throughout the world, Montessori is an educational philosophy and is not associated with a single organization. As a result of this, schools using the name Montessori can be vastly different. As the first Montessori school established in the United States and founding school of the American Montessori Society, Whitby is recognized as one of nation's premier Montessori schools.
Key Goals of a Montessori Education*
To foster competent, responsible, adaptive citizens who are lifelong learners and problem solvers
To promote learning in an inquiring, cooperative, nurturing atmosphere through self and teacher initiated experiences
To support learning through the senses, by manipulating materials and interacting with other, leading to the abstract understanding of ideas
To consider the individual as a whole: physical, emotional, social, aesthetic, spiritual and cognitive needs and interests are inseparable
