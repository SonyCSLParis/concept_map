Board of Directors/Officers
Lakeland Montessori's Board of Directors is a collection of concerned parents, educators, and community members that are committed to developing, implementing and continuing a long-term educational Montessori choice option in Polk County. Each member brings individual abilities and skills to aid in the development of our school.
The main concern in selecting members is to ensure that the group consists of not only educators, nor only parents, but a well-rounded range of members that can each bring their expertise together as a team to ensure that a Montessori education is available in our community. These expertise fields include such areas as law, education, real estate, international marketing, former experience on a board, economics and the ability to communicate our vision well to the community.
Harlan Crosswait serves as the Chairman and President of our Board of Directors. Mr. Crosswait has owned and operated Florida Financial &amp; Insurance Services in Lakeland, FL for many years and has an extensive marketing background that aids Lakeland Montessori in communicating its vision to the community, and in creating awareness of our program to parents. His financial and administration experience aid in the School's accountability in the financial areas. The academic education and community involvement of Mr. Crosswait's children and grandchildren were and continue to be an important concern to him. One evidence of this is his son's graduation from MIT with a doctorate degree in nuclear engineering and his service to the military and Senate of the United States. Mr. Crosswait's grandson has also graduated from Lakeland Montessori.
Tamika Plymill also serves on the Board of Directors. Ms. Plymill is a life-time resident of Lakeland and works at Publix Super Markets in banking.

Ms. Plymill's daughters also attended Lakeland Montesssori.

Mrs. Vailoces is the co-founder of the Bristol Integrated School providing her with both business and educational expertise that aid in the continued success of Lakeland Montessori Schoolhouse.
