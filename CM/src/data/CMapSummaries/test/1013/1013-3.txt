Hello and welcome to Montessori of Las Colinas! My name is Kristi Miller, Administrative Director. I have been educating children for more than 20 years and love what I do. Many of our families have been referred to our school by other parents whose children have been through our program. My passion for Montessori, children and early childhood education is shown in my dedication to our school, children and  families.
The Montessori environment is a non-competitive, self-paced learning system that offers a superior educational program. We are not just a school, but a community. Everyone who enters is considered a friend and every staff member is considered family.
We have a team of dedicated teachers who are friendly, loving and truly interested in meeting the needs of the families we serve. They have more than 60 years of combined experience and at least five years of working directly with children.
I truly believe that Montessori is the most brilliant teaching method ever used. Teachers in an authentic Montessori program like ours teach children how to learn and discover the world around them. I know that at our school, each child is being guided towards a lifelong love of learning
We are proud of all that we have to offer at Montessori of Las Colinas and we hope you will stop by to learn more about our programs.
Why Us
Montessori of Las Colinas opened in 1987. We are proud of the rich history we have in our community even more pleased about our long-standing reputation. Our school was built on three levels and each classroom community is a carefully prepared environment with a complete set of Montessori materials necessary for an authentic Montessori education. We also have two age-appropriate playgrounds that include a basketball hoop, soccer field and gardening area. We also encourage parent involvement, however, we understand that our parents are busy and may not be able to volunteer during the day. So we offer evening events through out the year like Education Nights, Open Houses &amp; Parent's Night Out.  We also have an annual Fall Festival, Thanksgiving Feast, an International Festival with a pot luck dinner, and Graduation. Come learn more about Montessori of Las Colinas today.
Our Programs
The Montessori Method was developed by Italian educator, Dr. Maria Montessori, in the early twentieth century. It is built upon the idea that children develop and think differently than adults, and that they are competent beings, capable of self-directed learning. We combine proven methods with the nurturing your child needs to discover and grow. Employing a vast selection of genuine Montessori materials that are practically irresistible, they help guide children along the path of true discovery. Our special, proven approach can help your child enhance independence, inspiration and intelligence. Toddler Program: Montessori of Las Colinas has four toddler rooms - two for children ages 13 months (and walking) to 24 months, and two for children 24-36 months. The classrooms offer an excellent ratio of child to teacher, so families can be confident that students are receiving personalized care. Our toddlers work and play in a loving environment that allows them to experience practical life exercises all day long. A part-time program is available. Primary Program: The children in the Primary Montessori classrooms work in a multi-aged learning environment. Each classroom has an area for practical life, sensorial, math, language, science, geography and art. The lessons are given individually and the child is then left to work independently. The Montessori teacher observes the child's progress with the materials and through observation, determines when the next lesson that should be given. Part-time programs are available.
