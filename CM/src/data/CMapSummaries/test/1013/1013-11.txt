Montessori Homeschooling
Montessori pre-schools have become very popular in the last decade or so and it seems the mention of their name conjures ideas of gifted and academically bright students. According to Dr. Montessori, a 19th century educator and medical doctor, such academic achievement is a result of children learning according to their interests in a supportive environment.
At the core, a Montessori education allows children to choose what they're interested in studying and encourages children to learn through all of their senses, not just through listening, watching and reading. A Montessori philosophy would say that if a child is encouraged to learn at his own pace, and study things that truly interest him, then the child will flourish, be motivated to further study and truly love learning.
If you are considering home schooling but want to give your child a Montessori education, consider the following adaptations in your home environment and home schooling schedule.
3 Hour Work Periods Children are encouraged to concentrate on their individual (and usually self-selected) work for one or two three hour periods per day. Students meet with teachers, but the long work period is never (well, relatively speaking) interrupted by the teacher to teach a lesson.
Work Centers A Montessori education allows children to move freely from one work center to another. The child should be allowed to linger as long as he would like at a particular center. There are no desks or chairs, because that would restrict movement and freedom.
Teach by Teaching The teacher does not correct student work. It is up to the teacher, through careful observation and record keeping, the determine what the child needs and to plan appropriate activities for him to learn and improve in weaknesses.
Renaissance Parenting All subjects are interwoven and no subject is taught in isolation. Teachers, or in this case parents, are to model the "renaissance" attitude when it comes to learning. They are to display a wide variety of interests and a wide base of knowledge.
Character Education Children's character is considered equally important as their academic development. Learning to share, community service and other positive character traits are taught.
Montessori Materials Montessori schools carefully select their learning materials and books. Materials are designed to engage children and encourage them to use all of their sense to explore and learn. A true Montessori school (or homeschool) would never allow a television or other electronic gadgets.
This is a good philosophy to follow if you like the idea of teaching in learning centers AND if you really can give your child chunks of time to work. I know in our house, getting a chunk of extended time without interruption would be impossible. Also, you will notice that the curriculum is child-directed which, as previously discussed, is difficult to deal with if your state has very strict home schooling regulations.
