Montessori School to launch middle school program
Hollis Montessori School announced in March it will launch a middle school program for the 2011-12 school year. The program will serve families in the Nashua region with students in grades 7 and 8. A limited number of students entering seventh grade will be accepted for Fall 2011, and previous Montessori experience is not required.
"This new program will provide families and students with a unique alternative to traditional education," Kari Headington, Director of the Hollis Montessori School said. "Our new Middle School will be the only Montessori program of its kind in New Hampshire, and we are certain that parents and students alike with be thrilled with what the program has to offer."
The program's integrated curriculum encompasses all of the disciplines of a traditional education, including mathematics, biology, chemistry, ecology, geography and cultural studies, history, grammar, literature, Latin, art, and physical education, but students will also have the opportunity to work together on original projects, follow specific areas of interest, and have direct, hands-on experiences as a regular part of their academic work.
Founded in 2008, Hollis Montessori School is an independent, non-profit school providing Montessori education to children ages 3 to 13. For more information, go to www.hollismontessori.org .
