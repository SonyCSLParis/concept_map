Childhood obesity is on the rise with approximately 2 million children being extremely obese. That is a scary number when you think about it. But what is the reason for childhood obesity? Is it because our kids are not as active as we were? Is it the marketing of fast food menus targeting busy families who don't have time to cook? Or is it because parents are irresponsible and not feeding their children proper nutrition? Doctors and fitness industry professionals believe it can be a combination of everything.
There has been a lot of recent focus on the parents of children with severe obesity problems. Doctors, lawyers, and society are debating as to whether parents should lose custody of their obese children. The goal isn't to punish the parents; the goal is to help the children, save their life and reunite them with their parents. But is this really the answer?
Intervention may be necessary in cases like the story of a 3 year old girl who weighed 90 pounds and by 12 weighed 400 pounds and developed type II diabetes, high cholesterol and blood pressure, and suffered from sleep apnea. However, with proper education of nutrition and exercise for the entire family, that child's life can be saved.
There are many risk factors in a child becoming obese and usually it's a combination of a few, but the good news is, if parents understand these factors they can prevent the child from obesity.
Diet - eating high calorie foods like fast food, fried food, and sugary snacks on a regular basis can cause weight gain. Provide healthy foods, fruits and vegetables and have treats in moderation.
No exercise - children who watch too much TV or play videos games are not active enough and don't burn calories. This teaches them a sedentary lifestyle at a young age. Get them involved in personal training Arlington Heights IL.
Family history - if everyone else is overweight, most likely the children will follow. Parents need to lead by example of healthy eating and exercise.
Psychological reasons - A lot of people tend to eat to deal with stress, emotional issues, and boredom...children are no different. Pay attention to their emotions.
Busy parents/families - Life can be busy and people look for quick and convenient ways to cook or eat meals. Stocking the refrigerator and pantry with processed foods and sugary snacks may be convenient but it is detrimental to your diet and health.
All of us in the fitness and health industry would like to see everyone: parents, kids, society, and the media, work together to educate our youth about the importance of eating nutritional, well-balanced meals and getting some exercise. If everyone unites together the childhood obesity rate will decrease and our children will be healthier and happier.
