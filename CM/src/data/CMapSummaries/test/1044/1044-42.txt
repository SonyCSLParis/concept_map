Good parenting or figure fascism?
Andrea Black
Childhood obesity is at an all-time high. According to the latest figures available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics a quarter of children aged 5 - 17 years are overweight or obese, up 4 percentage points from 1995. So when a mother decides to do something about her daughter, deemed by a paediatrician to be 'clinically obese', shouldn't we be applauding her? After all that's one less statistic, albeit in the USA. Not if the mother is Dara-Lyn Weiss.
Weiss wrote a story about putting her 7-year-old daughter, Bea, on a strict Weight Watchers-style diet in the April edition of US Vogue . The article included details of Weiss's weight loss incentive scheme - 'many pretty dresses' - and, as proof of the diet's success, "before" and "after" pictures. The inevitable furore ensued.
Using rewards to motivate weight loss may be questionable but what really got readers riled was the author's willingness to publicly shame Bea into conforming to the diet. Among other punishments, Weiss admitted to chiding her daughter for failures to 'self-regulate' at children's parties.
"I often derided Bea for not refusing the inappropriate snack. And there have been many awkward moments at parties, when Bea has wanted to eat, say, both cookies and cake, and I've engaged in a heated public discussion about why she can't," Weiss wrote.
She even publicly lobbed Bea's small hot chocolate into the bin when a Starbucks barista failed to report its precise calorie count.
Public derision and the Vogue writer's own dysfunctional issues with food aside, experts say that parents should steer clear of putting children on diets.
"The worst thing a parent can do is have their child focus on weight loss as a goal," says Psychotherapist and Managing Director of BodyMatters Australasia, Lydia Jade Turner.
"Dieting appears to be causally linked to both obesity and eating disorders and dieting also increases risk of binge eating, cycles of weight regain and loss, reduced self-esteem, food and body preoccupation, weight stigma, and future weight gain. It teaches a child that their body cannot be trusted and increases shame, which is harmful to their physical and emotional development."
Turner advocates encouraging kids to find physical movement that is enjoyable for them, while teaching them to listen to their internal cues for hunger and satiety, distinguishing between physical, emotional, and sensory hunger.
"Every day they can go to bed feeling good about themselves for engaging in healthy behaviours, rather than feeling distressed that they are not yet a certain number on the scale," she says.
According to Dannielle Miller's new book, The Girl with the Butterfly Tattoo (Random House), a Victorian study of kids aged 12 to 17 years showed 38 per cent of girls and 12 per cent of boys were intermediate to extreme dieters - that is, they were at risk of an eating disorder. And a Sydney study of children aged 11 to 15 reported that 16 per cent of the girls and 7 per cent of the boys had already used at least one potentially dangerous method of weight reduction, including starvation, vomiting and laxative abuse.
"Within two years, 95 per cent of people who go on weight-loss diets, including commercial diets, regain all the weight they lost, plus more," says Miller who co-founded Enlighten Education, offering programs helping teenage girls decode the mixed messages they receive and develop self-esteem.
Miller believes that any talk about weight around children needs to be handled with care.
"Focus on the health aspects such as nutritious choices and an active lifestyle rather than size; whether a child is overweight or too thin," she says.
"And most importantly, lead by example, it important that the parent not be a hyprocrite, they should be eating right too and not be on a computer all day," says Miller.
Internet uproar over children and dieting is not new. The recently released children's book Maggie Goes on a Diet about a teenager who loses weight and suddenly leaves her insecurities behind caused much ado and Walt Disney World in Florida recently had to 're-tool' a childhood obesity exhibit after critics deemed it insensitive.
Children are already dealing with increasingly unrealistic images of (Photoshopped) bodies and the thriving juggernaut of the diet industry feeding body image insecurities. Add to this a culture that equates fat with moral failure and you have the perfect conditions for creating an eating disorder , says Turner.
"It's important to explain that bodies come in different shapes and sizes and that food is not a moral issue.
"There is nothing inherently 'bad' or 'sinful' about eating chocolate cake, yet walking down our supermarket aisles we see labels that scream '99% guilt-free!' as if the word guilt and fat are somehow synonymous. They are not, and often it is negative feelings such as 'guilt' associated with food that drive people to binge eat or eat in a manner that is out of tune with their internal signals of hunger and satiety," warns Turner.
Who knows what will happen to little Bea, forced on to a diet, publicly humiliated and then written about in a fashion bible.
"Only time will tell whether my early intervention saved her from a life of preoccupation with her weight, or drove her to it," Weiss writes.
And, despite the backlash, Dara-Lynn Weiss was rewarded herself, with a book deal.

It just comes back once again to poor parenting. Some mothers have a strange way of displaying love to their daughters. Thank God I'm a male and I avoided all that. LIFESTYLE, EDUCATION, LIFESTYLE, EDU..... get that right, and you don't have to give a thought to dieting.

I think, as a parent, if we saw our child putting on unhealthy amounts of weight we would need to ask ourselves how they got there and look at how we could support them to alter their lifestyle to support a healthier weight. However, with some overweight children I have seen, they really do need to be told - EAT LESS! The amount I have seen one overweight 8 year old put away for lunch one day almost made me sick, it appeared positively pathological. I would not tolerate such a thing in my own children and if they were to begin to display such eating behaviour I would say something - not in front of their peers - but privately let them know, it's wrong and it's not healthy.

The thing is where are these children getting all this food from?! It's the parents, obviously. Yes kids go out to parties and stuff, but most of the food they will eat will come from home. If parents only have healthy food at home, it doesn't matter how ravenous a child's appetite, if they can only gorge themselves on broccoli or apples then they won't get fat. If they don't like eating healthy food tough. They'll eat it if they're hungry enough and if they don't well at least they won't be fat.

@T, I agree. The child I was sickened to see gorging a lunch that their mother had packed ate enough in one sitting that would sustain one of my children for a whole day. The mother was fully aware that the child had weight issues and yet still packed the most ridiculously big lunch, had some nice healthy stuff in there, and also unhealthy stuff too, all of it in much greater quantity than was needed. I watched this child scoff it all down and could barely control my gag reflex. Teaching children to eat slowly, with manners also helps them learn to regulate appetite because they give their body time to send their brain the signal that they are full. This child was clearly allowed to eat like a pig - consuming as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and incredibly messy - it was horrible to witness and no doubt contributed to the child's inability to self-regulate because their body was never getting the chance to listen to itself due to the rate and quantity of food being shovelled into their face. I don't understand how any parent could think such eating habits are acceptable.

@Jac - I don't understand how any decent human being could not be repulsed by your shaming and degrading of this 8 year old child. Perhaps this child has been subjected to the body police such as yourself many times before and has developed an eating disorder. Using words such as 'gorge', 'scoff', 'messy' and the most disgusting reference to 'eating like a pig' has the potential to compound self image issues and turn to food for comfort. I don't believe you're in a position to comment on manners when making derogatory comments on other parents, let alone their children. It is the business of the parent and child, not yours, and if shaming them worked, there would not be a fat person in the whole country. This is part of what this article addresses.

@Lviv At no time did I say anything to the overweight child. I kept my thoughts to myself and only shared them on this forum because that is what I think in the context of this article. A parent that cannot teach their child to eat with manners, to eat a reasonable portion size at a reasonable pace is not doing the child any favours. Maybe you don't mind seeing people literally shovelling obscenely large amounts of foods into themselves like animals but I do, what hope does that child have or ever being able to self-regulate their food intake? What hope have they of ever being able to maintain a healthy weight and develop a confident body-image when they have not been raised to eat in such a way that supports a healthy weight? Outwardly demonising may not help (which is why I do not directly say anything to people that clearly need some help in the weight department), but neither does the airy-fairy fat-acceptance mentality of some people. Eating like a pig is not acceptable, I think it is disgusting no matter the weight-range of a person who engages in such eating habits. At least my own values are reflected in my own offspring that are all maintaining wonderfully healthy and fit bodies, within a healthy weight range and have the kind of manners that not only make them agreeable table companions but helps their bodies self-regulate their own food intake.

There's a kid at our school on a diet - the kid's pretty chubby, and the parents have left no one in any doubt about their child being overweight. They tell everyone, sotto voce when in earshot of the child, that their child is "on a diet because they're a bit fat". A recent BYO food family event saw the family sitting around drinking soft-drinks, including the chubby child! The kid went off to school camp, and the parents rejoiced that they could have take-away food for three nights in a row since the child would be out of the house.
How will this kid ever change their eating behaviour if the parents don't make a whole-family effort to change? It's not about dieting - it's just about eating the right amounts of the right food in the first place. And not shaming the child when, most of the time, it's the parents who make food choices on behalf of their kids.

I wonder whether those parents actually realise what they could be doing to their child. My experience as a child showed me that fat shaming by parents is really irresponsible parenting. When I was about 11 or 12, my parents decided I was a bit chubby. When they took me to the doctor, he told them not to worry because it was just the family physique (we're a solid, not fat, family). They obviously disagreed with the medical opinion, because they took me to Weight Watchers anyway. Cue the development of an eating disorder...
Teach your kids about making healthy choices and to enjoy exercise by all means, but steer clear from telling them that there's something wrong with them and definitely avoid any messages that suggest being skinny is more important than being healthy.

A child - adults too - has enough negative reinforcement about weight, let alone be shamed by their parents too. Then there is the danger that the parent of a thinner child associating that size with good health and not engaging in healthier food and body movement. Lydia Turner is quite correct.

I have a severely morbidly obese stepson who is 64kg and only 8 years old. He has been reported to DHS by the school who have been so concerned at his every increasing girth and his mother has been ordered to the paedatrician and dietician to do something about it. His father and I have tried to do all the right things, encourage excercise and outdoor play, only feed them homemade nutricious meals, but what do you do when this is all undone by a birthmother who feeds them crap and mcdonald's and lets them watch endless hours of TV. This kid can hardly move a few metres without puffing and I had to replace all his clothes again after just a few wears and he is in a mens size 97 jean now. What else is there left to do? There are no programs or services for childhood obesity within 100km of our location.
