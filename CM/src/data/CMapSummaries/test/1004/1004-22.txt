What is depression in children and teens?
Depression is a serious mood disorder that can take the joy from a child's life. It is normal for a child to be moody or sad from time to time. You can expect these feelings after the death of a pet or a move to a new city. But if these feelings last for weeks or months, they may be a sign of depression.
Experts used to think that only adults could get depression. Now we know that even a young child can have depression that needs treatment to improve. As many as 2 out of 100 young children and 8 out of 100 teens have serious depression. 1
Still, many children don't get the treatment they need. This is partly because it can be hard to tell the difference between depression and normal moodiness. Also, depression may not look the same in a child as in an adult.
If you are worried about your child, learn more about the symptoms in children. Talk to your child to see how he or she is feeling. If you think your child is depressed, talk to your doctor or a counselor. The sooner a child gets treatment, the sooner he or she will start to feel better.
What are the symptoms?
A child may be depressed if he or she:
Is grumpy, sad, or bored most of the time.
Does not take pleasure in things he or she used to enjoy.
A child who is depressed may also:
Lose or gain weight.
Sleep too much or too little.
Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty.
Have trouble concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.
Think about death or suicide a lot.
The symptoms of depression are often overlooked at first. It can be hard to see that symptoms are all part of the same problem.
Also, the symptoms may be different depending on how old the child is.
Very young children may lack energy and become withdrawn. They may show little emotion, seem to feel hopeless, and have trouble sleeping.
Grade-school children may have a lot of headaches or stomachaches. They may lose interest in friends and activities that they liked in the past. Some children with severe depression may see or hear things that aren't there ( hallucinate ) or have false beliefs ( delusions ).
Teens may sleep a lot or move or speak more slowly than usual. Teens with severe depression may hallucinate or have delusions.
Depression can range from mild to severe. A child who feels a little "down" most of the time for a year or more may have a mild, ongoing form of depression called dysthymia (say "dis-THY-mee-uh"). In its most severe form, depression can cause a child to lose hope and want to die.
Whether depression is mild or severe, there are treatments that can help.
What causes depression?
Just what causes depression is not well understood. But it is linked to an imbalance of brain chemicals that affect mood. Things that may cause these chemicals to get out of balance include:
Stressful events, such as changing schools, going through a divorce, or having a death in the family.
How is depression diagnosed?
To diagnose depression, a doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about the child's past health. You may be asked to fill out a form about your child's symptoms. The doctor may ask your child questions to learn more about how the child thinks, acts, and feels.
Some diseases can cause symptoms that look like depression. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia .
How is it treated?
Usually one of the first steps in treating depression is education for the child and his or her family. Teaching both the child and the family about depression can be a big help. It makes them less likely to blame themselves for the problem. Sometimes it can help other family members see that they are also depressed.
Counseling may help the child feel better. The type of counseling will depend on the age of the child. For young children, play therapy may be best. Older children and teens may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy . This type of counseling can help them change negative thoughts that make them feel bad.
Medicine may be an option if the child is very depressed. Combining antidepressant medicine with counseling often works best. A child with severe depression may need to be treated in the hospital.
There are some things you can do at home to help your child start to feel better.
Urge your child to get regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep.
See that your child takes any medicine as prescribed and goes to all follow-up appointments.
Make time to talk and listen to your child. Ask how he or she is feeling. Express your love and support.
Remind your child that things will get better in time.
What should you know about antidepressant medicines?
Antidepressant medicines often work well for children who are depressed. But there are some important things you should know about these medicines.
Children who take antidepressants should be watched closely. These medicines may increase the risk that a child will think about or try suicide, especially in the first few weeks of use. If your child takes an antidepressant, learn the warning signs of suicide, and get help right away if you see any of them. Common warning signs include:
Talking, drawing, or writing about death.
Giving away belongings.
Withdrawing from family and friends.
Having a way to do it, such as a gun or pills.
Your child may start to feel better after 1 to 3 weeks of taking antidepressant medicine. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. Make sure your child takes antidepressants as prescribed and keeps taking them so they have time to work.
A child may need to try several different antidepressants to find one that works. If you notice any warning signs or have concerns about the medicine, or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your child's doctor.
Do not let a child suddenly stop taking antidepressants. This could be dangerous. Your doctor can help you taper off the dose slowly to prevent problems.
Depression is thought to be caused by an imbalance of chemicals called neurotransmitters that send messages between nerve cells in your brain. Some of these chemicals, such as serotonin, help regulate mood. If these mood-influencing chemicals get out of balance, depression or other mood disorders can result. Experts have not yet identified why neurotransmitters become imbalanced. They believe a change can occur as a response to stress or illness. But a change may also occur with no obvious trigger.
There are several things known to increase the chances that a young person may become depressed.
Depression runs in families. Children and teens who have a parent with depression are more likely to develop depression than children with parents who are not depressed. Experts believe that both inherited traits (genetics) as well as living with a parent who is depressed can cause depression.
Depression in children and teens may be linked to stress, social problems, and unresolved family conflict. It can also be linked to traumatic events, such as violence, abuse, or neglect.
Children or teens who have long-term or serious medical conditions, learning problems, or behavior problems are more likely to develop depression.
Some medicines can trigger depression, such as steroids or narcotics for pain relief. As soon as the medicine is stopped, symptoms usually disappear.
The symptoms of depression are often subtle at first. They may occur suddenly or happen slowly over time. It can be hard to recognize that symptoms may be connected and that your child might have depression.
Children who are depressed may have the following symptoms:
Physical symptoms:
Unexplained aches and pains, such as headaches or stomach pain
Trouble sleeping, or sleeping too much
Changes in eating habits that lead to weight gain or loss or not making expected weight gains
Constant tiredness, lack of energy
Body movements that seem slow, restless, or agitated
Mental or emotional symptoms:
Irritability or temper tantrums
Difficulty thinking and making decisions
Having low self-esteem , being self-critical, and/or feeling that others are unfairly critical
Feelings of guilt and hopelessness
Social withdrawal, such as lack of interest in friends
Anxiety, such as worrying too much or fearing separation from a parent
Thinking about death or feeling suicidal
It's important to watch for warning signs of suicide in your child or teen . These signs may change with age. Warning signs of suicide in children and teens may include preoccupation with death or suicide or a recent breakup of a relationship.
Depression can have symptoms that are similar to those caused by other conditions .
Less common symptoms
Severely depressed children may also have other symptoms, such as:
Hearing voices that aren't there ( hallucinations ). This is more common in young children.
Having false but firmly held beliefs ( delusions ). This is more common in teens.
For example, grieving ( bereavement ) is a normal response to loss, such as the death of a family member or even the death a pet, loss of a friendship, or parents' divorce. After a severe loss, a child may remain sad for a longer period of time.
But when these emotions do not go away or begin to interfere with the young person's life, he or she may need treatment.
Bipolar disorder
Some children who are first diagnosed with depression are later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Children or teens with bipolar disorder have extreme mood swings between depression and bouts of mania (very high energy, agitation, or irritability).
It can be hard to tell the difference between bipolar disorder and depression. It is common for children with bipolar disorder to first be diagnosed with only depression and later to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a first manic episode. Although depression is part of the condition, bipolar disorder requires different treatment than depression alone.
Like depression, bipolar disorder runs in families. So be sure to tell your doctor if your child has a family history of bipolar disorder. For more information on bipolar disorder, see the topic Bipolar Disorder in Children and Teens .
What Happens
At first, depression in a child or teen may appear as irritability, sadness, or sudden, unexplained crying. He or she may lose interest in activities enjoyed in the past or may feel unloved and hopeless. He or she may have problems in school and become withdrawn or defiant.
An episode of depression lasts an average of 8 months. 1 Even with successful treatment, as many as 40 out of 100 children with depression will have another episode within a few years. 2
Less than half of children and teens with depression receive treatment. 3 This may be partly due to the old belief that young people don't get depression.
Also, teens often do not seek help for depression. They may think feeling bad is normal, they may blame something else (or themselves) for their symptoms, or they may not know where to go for help. Tell your child to ask for help if he or she feels bad. And let your child know who to go to for help with depression or other problems.
Drugs and alcohol
Some teens will have alcohol or drug use problems along with depression. When this happens, depression is harder to treat, and it can take longer for treatment to work. Drug or alcohol use also increases the risk of suicide.
Early diagnosis and treatment of depression and good communication with your child can help prevent substance abuse. For more information about substance abuse in young people, see the topic Teen Alcohol and Drug Abuse .
Often a child who is depressed will have other disorders along with depression, such as an anxiety disorder , a behavior disorder like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , an eating disorder , or a learning disorder. These problems may occur before a young person becomes depressed. Some children with depression develop serious behavior problems ( conduct disorder ), often after becoming depressed. If your child has one of these disorders, it may require treatment along with depression.
Other problems
Children and teens with depression are also at a higher risk for problems such as:
Poor school or job performance.
Problems in relationships with peers and family members.
Early pregnancy.
Physical illness.
For severe depression, your child may need to be hospitalized, especially if he or she is out of touch with reality ( psychotic ) or is having thoughts of suicide.
During treatment for depression, make sure that your child takes medicines and attends counseling appointments as directed, even if he or she feels better. A common cause of relapse is stopping treatment too soon.
It is extremely important that you take all threats of suicide seriously and seek immediate treatment for your child or teenager. If you are a child or teen and have these feelings, talk with your parents, an adult friend, or your doctor right away to get some help. If your child is suicidal, call 911 or other emergency services immediately .
What Increases Your Risk
Several things increase a young person's chance of developing depression. These include:
Having a parent or immediate family member who is depressed. This is the most important risk factor for depression. Children or teens who have a parent with depression are 3 times more likely to develop depression.
Having been depressed before, especially if depression first occurred at an early age.
Who To See
Treatment for depression may involve professional counseling , medicines, education about depression for your child and your family, or a combination of these. It is important that your child establish a long-term and comfortable relationship with the care providers for the treatment of depression.
Your child may be diagnosed and treated by more than one health professional, including a:
Exams and Tests
Your doctor or another health professional will evaluate and diagnose depression in your child by asking questions about your child's medical history and conducting tests to find out if symptoms are caused by something other than depression. Your child may be given a physical exam or blood tests to rule out conditions such as hypothyroidism and anemia . Your child may be asked to complete a mental health assessment , which tests his or her ability to think, reason, and remember.
You may be asked to help complete a pediatric symptom checklist, a brief screening questionnaire that helps to diagnose depression or other psychological problems in children. Also, your child may be asked to take a short written or verbal test for depression.
Sometimes a more thorough evaluation may be needed to fully assess your child's depression. Interviews may be conducted with the parents or with other people who know the young person well. Specific information may be obtained from the child's teachers or from social service workers.
Medicines used to treat childhood depression include several types of drugs called antidepressants.
An important part of treatment is making sure that your child takes medicines as prescribed. Often people who feel better after taking an antidepressant for a period of time may feel like they are "cured" and no longer need treatment. But when medicine is stopped too early, symptoms usually return. So it is important that your child follows the treatment plan.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued advisories stating that people who are taking antidepressants for depression, along with their family members and their doctors, should watch for warning signs of suicide . Before prescribing medicine, your doctor will check your child for possible suicidal thoughts by asking a few questions. See a list of questions your doctor may ask your child.
For more information on antidepressants, see the Medications section of this topic.
Education of your child and family members can be provided by a doctor either informally or in family therapy. Some of the most important things that your child and family members can learn include:
Knowing how to make sure a child is following a treatment plan, such as taking medicine correctly and going to counseling appointments.
Learning ways to reduce stress caused by living with someone who has depression.
Knowing the signs of a relapse and what to do to prevent depression from recurring.
Knowing the signs of suicidal behavior, how to evaluate their seriousness, and how to respond.
Learning how to identify signs of a manic episode, which is a bout of extremely high mood and energy, or irritability that is a sign of bipolar disorder .
Seeking treatment if you are a parent with depression. If a parent's depression goes untreated, it may interfere with the recovery of the child.
Additional treatment
Your child may need treatment for other disorders that may be causing ongoing symptoms, such as:
If your child is depressed, consider removing all guns and potentially fatal medicines from your home, especially if your child has shown any warning signs of suicide. Although overdosing on medicine is the most common way that teens attempt suicide, your child is at higher risk for completing a suicide if you have a gun in your home, particularly if it is easy to get to it or if you store it loaded. 5
It is difficult to prevent a first episode of depression, but it may be possible to prevent or reduce the severity of future episodes of depression ( relapses ).
There is some evidence that if a child receives cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a group setting, it can help prevent or delay the onset of depression in a child or teen whose parent has depression (which puts the child at greater risk for becoming depressed). 6
Make sure that your child has a good social support system, both at home and through teachers, other family members, and friends who can provide encouragement and understanding.
Learn to recognize early symptoms of depression, and seek immediate diagnosis and treatment if they occur.
Some schools provide educational materials and group therapy opportunities to those at high risk for depression, such as those who have family conflict or problems with peers.
Home Treatment
Do everything possible to provide a supportive family environment. Love, understanding, and regular communication are some of the most important things you can provide to help your child cope with depression.
In addition to having a positive home life, staying in professional counseling, and taking medicines as prescribed, good lifestyle habits can help reduce your child's symptoms of depression. Encourage your child to:
Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs, nonprescription medicines, herbal therapies, and medicines that have not been prescribed (because they may interfere with the medicines used to treat depression).
Get enough sleep. If your child has problems sleeping, he or she might try:
Going to bed at the same time every night.
Keeping the bedroom dark and quiet.
Not exercising after 5:00 p.m.
Eat a balanced diet . If your child lacks an appetite, try to get him or her to eat small snacks rather than large meals.
Be hopeful about feeling better. Positive thinking is very important in recovering from depression. It is difficult to be hopeful when you feel depressed, but remind your child that improvement occurs gradually and takes time.
If you notice any warning signs of suicide (such as aggressive or hostile behavior, excessive thoughts about death, or detachment from reality) seek professional help immediately by calling either your child's doctor, a professional counselor, or a local mental health or emergency services. Call 911 if you feel your child is in immediate danger.
Although experts believe that, for many children with depression, the benefits of medicine outweigh the risks, research on antidepressant medicine in children is limited. The long-term effects and safety of medicines used to treat depression in children and teens are still unknown.
You may have heard about concerns regarding a possible connection between antidepressant medicines and suicidal behavior. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued advisories about this issue.
Especially during the first few weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, there is a possible increase in suicidal feelings or behavior. A child beginning antidepressant treatment should be watched closely. But children with untreated depression are also at an increased risk for suicide. So it is important to carefully weigh all of the risks and benefits of antidepressant medicine.
What to Think About
Antidepressant medicines such as fluoxetine (Prozac, for example) can be effective in treating depression, but it may take 1 to 3 weeks before your child starts to feel better. It can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. Make sure your child takes antidepressant medicines as prescribed and keeps taking them so they have time to work. If you have any questions or concerns about the medicine, or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your child's doctor.
SSRIs may also be effective in treating other conditions such as anxiety .
Your child may have to try several medicines before the most effective treatment is discovered. After the right medicine is found, your child may need to continue taking the medicine for several months or longer after the symptoms of depression have subsided, to prevent depression from occurring again.
Some children who are first diagnosed with depression are later diagnosed with bipolar disorder , which has symptoms that cycle from depression to mania (very high energy, often with euphoria, agitation, irritability, risk-taking behavior, or impulsiveness). If your child or teen has bipolar disorder, a first episode of mania can happen spontaneously. But it can also be triggered by certain medicines such as stimulants or antidepressants. That is why it is very important to tell your child's doctor about any family history of bipolar disorder and to watch your child closely for signs of manic behavior. For more information about bipolar disorder in young people, see the topic Bipolar Disorder in Children and Teens .
FDA Advisory. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an advisory on antidepressant medicines and the risk of suicide. The FDA does not recommend that people stop using these medicines. Instead, a person taking antidepressants should be watched for warning signs of suicide . This is especially important at the beginning of treatment or when doses are changed.
Other Treatment
Complementary medicines such as St. John's wort have been used to treat depression in adults. But there is no evidence that these therapies are safe for use by children or teens. 2 They can also interfere with other medicines, such as antidepressants.
Other Treatment Choices
Types of counseling most often used to treat depression in children and teens are:
Family therapy , which provides a place for the whole family to express fears and concerns and learn new ways of getting along.
Play therapy , which is used with young children or children with developmental delays to help them cope with fears and anxieties. But there is no proof that this type of treatment reduces symptoms of depression.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an effective treatment for a teen or older child who is severely depressed or does not respond to other treatment, although this treatment is rarely used for children and teens. Even though it is an effective treatment for adults with major depression, there are currently no long-term studies on the safety of using ETC. 2
What to Think About
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implant for treatment of depression in adults. This device may be used when other treatments for depression have not worked.
A generator the size of a pocket watch is placed in the chest. Wires go up the neck from the generator to the vagus nerve. The generator sends tiny electric shocks through the vagus nerve to that part of the brain that is believed to play a role in mood.
How well the VNS implant works for children has not been well studied, and the device is expensive. 7
