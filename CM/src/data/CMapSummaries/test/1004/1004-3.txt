Depression in youth appears to be common as the following estimates of depression show: 1
0.9% in preschool-aged children experience depression
1.9% in school-aged children experience depression

The latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) makes very little distinction between depression in kids and adults.

Causes of Depression in Children
The causes of depression in children have not yet been pinpointed, but factors are thought to be genetic, physiological and psychological. Over time, diagnosis of depression in kids is being seen at younger and younger ages. Poor psychosocial, school and family functioning all appear to contribute to the causes of depression in children.
Dysfunctions in the brain are one of the causes of depression in children. In one study, youth (under 18 years) hospitalized for depression were found to have unusual frontal lobe and lateral ventricular volumes in the brain. In other words, some parts of the brain appear to be underdeveloped while others appear to be overdeveloped in depressed children.
Other causes of depression in children appear to include:
Sexual or physical abuse or neglect
A mentally ill parent
The more mental illness in a family, the younger depression tends to develop
Possibly a lack of involvement by the father and overprotection by the mother
