The only way to answer that question is with a resounding "yes!" But because children have limited life experience, they may not even realize that they're depressed. It's up to family members and teachers to recognize the signs and symptoms of childhood depression.
As with adult depression, childhood depression does not get better on its own. The sooner depression is treated, the better the chance of full recovery. If your child is having behavioral problems or is not acting like "himself," talk to your child's pediatrician about the possibility of childhood depression. Your child's doctor will rule out any other physical causes of your child's symptoms.
Children are also subject to dysthymia (chronic depression). Dysthymia is diagnosed in children if the symptoms of mild depression are present for one year. Again, if you notice changes in your child's behavior, mood, attitude, sleeping or eating habits, talk with your child's pediatrician.
As with adults, some children may experience depression of a purely biological nature. That is, there does not necessarily have to be an event that causes the depression. Of course, events can trigger depression in children.
If your child experiences a major life event (for example, loss of a family member or pet, change in school, major illness), talk to your child about how he or she is feeling. Children do not know what is or is not okay to talk about unless adults take the lead. They may assume that if you do not bring up the topic with them that they are on their own in dealing with it. This isolation can be very detrimental to a child and can easily lead to childhood depression or dysthymia.
