Gifted Education
"You don't need to look far for evidence that we Americans don't place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. But our schools, with their high academic standards, high-stakes tests, and performance bonuses for improved achievement scores -- surely our schools are bastions of intellectualism? Not necessarily." Kathleen Vail, " Nurturing the Life of the Mind ,"  American School Board Journal
Forty-seven states completed the survey. The resulting picture shows a patchwork of gifted services, little teacher training in recognizing or serving gifted children, modest funding, and a lack of accountability for educating high-ability learners... Depressing! Is American Education Neglecting Gifted Children? by David Nagel in The Journal summarizes the bad news
Educational acceleration is one of the cornerstones of exemplary gifted education practices, with more research supporting this intervention than any other in the literature on gifted individuals. See Academic Acceleration for more...
There are far fewer lower-income students achieving at the highest levels than there should be, they disproportionately fall out of the high-achieving group during elementary and high school, they rarely rise into the ranks of high achievers during those periods, and, perhaps most disturbingly, far too few ever graduate from college or go on to graduate school. [It] is not that high-achieving students from lower-income backgrounds are suffering more than other lower-income students, but that their talents are similarly under-nurtured...

If you have a very bright student, home-school him. My son was reading a college-level book in third grade. Academically, we figured he'd learn and grow regardless of the environment. We believed childhood should include high school sports teams and clubs... We decided to leave him in public school. To minimize frustration, we focused my son on learning, not grades. If he could get a 100 on an exam without doing the homework, we believed his time was better spent doing another activity in which he actually learned something...

Our task as educators is to place the extremely, gifted child in the environment that will least restrict her opportunities for socialization. Research suggests that the inclusion classroom, with age peers, may not be the most appropriate environment
The Davidsons offer an absorbing look at how our nation is neglecting children of exceptional intelligence. They make a compelling case for re-approaching giftedness as a potential disability (to give more attention to gifted kids) and an even stronger argument for parents, teachers and citizens to consider the potential loss to American society in the costliest imaginable terms.

While the nation's lowest-achieving youngsters made rapid gains from 2000 to 2007, the performance of top students was languid. This pattern big gains for low achievers and lesser ones for high achievers is associated with the introduction of accountability systems in general, not just NCLB. In spite of teachers' own personal beliefs, low-achieving students receive dramatically more attention from teachers. Low-income, black, and Hispanic high achievers were more likely than low achievers to be taught by experienced teachers...

Conspicuously missing from the debate over the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act is a discussion of how it has hurt many of our most capable children. By forcing schools to focus their time and funding almost entirely on bringing low-achieving students up to proficiency, NCLB sacrifices the education of the gifted students who will become our future biomedical researchers, computer engineers and other scientific leaders...

The U.S. must mobilize for excellence in mathematics and science education so that all students   not just a select few, or those fortunate enough to attend certain schools   achieve much higher levels of math and science learning. Over the coming decades, today's young people will depend on the skills and knowledge developed from learning math and science to analyze problems, imagine solutions, and bring productive new ideas into being. The nation's capacity to innovate for economic growth and the ability of American workers to thrive in the global economy depend on a broad foundation of math and science learning...
These are the times that try gifted educators' souls. These are the times when gifted education is under attack as never before. It is not unusual for gifted education to come under attack. Gifted education has frequently been the target of opposition and misunderstanding, such as the confounded idea that equity is threatened by the excellence of gifted education, when everyone knows that historically, excellent minds have always been in the vanguard of the demand for equity. What is unusual, what tries our souls at this moment in the history of gifted education, is that gifted education is under intellectual attack... Also read All Children Are Gifted also by Michael C.

Response to Intervention (RtI) is yet another approach to ensure services for children who demonstrate special needs in the classroom. Neither NCLB nor RtI were designed with gifted children in mind. However, NCLB had sweeping ramifications for how money was spent in schools, and RtI may govern how gifted children with and without accompanying disabilities are identified and served...

The new study, by the independent Center on Education Policy, showed that more students are reaching the "advanced" level on state tests now than in 2002. This led the authors to conclude that there is little evidence that high-achieving students have been shortchanged.

We have never identified excellent teachers in any reliable, objective way. Instead, we tend to ascribe their gifts to some mystical quality... For this story, Teach for America allowed me access to 20 years of experimentation. The results are specific and surprising.

Other things that may sound trifling like a teacher's extracurricular accomplishments in college tend to predict greatness...
"Some advocates for gifted and talented students fear that the Senate version of President Bush's education plan to "leave no child behind" would not help the students with the highest academic ability get ahead."

Many laws are too optimistic, but the No Child Left Behind Act transcended optimism. It set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality. The schools try to teach everyone, but some kids can't handle the material. That's just the way the things are; it is not a problem that can be fixed. For the good of our children, educational romanticism needs to collapse, and quickly. Its effects play out in the lives of young people in devastating ways.

Our brightest students are not learning in school. The fact is that No Child Left Behind is promoting underachievement among our nation's brightest students, denying an appropriately challenging education to millions. That is because although the plan promises that every child will learn how to read by the third grade, it does nothing to ensure that students who already knew how to read in kindergarten will continue to learn. For these exceptionally gifted students, No Child Left Behind means no child can move ahead. Students cannot learn unless they are being taught something new. Focusing on minimum performance standards to the exclusion of everything else neglects students who learn faster than the minimum standards...

In a no-child-left-behind conception of public education, lifting everyone up to a minimum level is more important than allowing students to excel to their limit.

How experts define giftedness and what parents and educators can do to support a child's special abilities.

Gifted students - there are about 3 million in the US - are not getting what they need from the public education system. Programs for the gifted are disappearing in districts across the country because of budget cuts, shifting priorities and, some allege, because of the federal "No Child Left Behind" act. Critics of "No Child Left Behind" claim that the law's emphasis on the lowest performing students is leading districts to ignore gifted children...
Support for educating the gifted is booming in many European countries. The generally held opinion during the previous century was that highly able students did not need special attention or extra facilities; the gifted in schools were completely neglected.

Gifted elementary-school students are languishing unchallenged by regular-classroom practices and would be better served if they were freed from covering up to 70 percent of the standard curriculum or were grouped by ability, a federally funded research project concludes.

For years, academically gifted children were thought to fit neatly into a category. If they took a test and landed above a predetermined score, a menu of enrichment activities and accelerated classes would open up to them.

Instead of being innate and immutable, giftedness can be nurtured and even taught and if ignored... Or read EdWeek's interview with the book's editors... The Evolving Definition of Giftedness
It is honorable that we stretch ourselves financially to provide education and opportunity for everyone. Our society would be much worse off if we did not take special care of our disabled children.

Instead, we throw them into the triage of the public school system and hope they'll fend for themselves and turn out OK...
It is unreasonable to deny that some students are outstanding or have exceptional potential for excellence in one or more areas. With or without a "gifted" label, some students are atypical. The more atypical they are, the less the standard curriculum will address their educational needs. They will not just need something more. They will need something different...

In a test-driven U.S. educational system, gifted students " and their test scores " are becoming a valuable and sometimes misused commodity.

The dual and desirable educational goals of student equity and student excellence have often been in a serious struggle for scarce resources. Equity ensures all students a fair shot at a good education. Excellence promises every student the right to achieve as far and as high as he or she is capable. Because the problems of equity have greater immediacy than does the long-term enhancement of excellence, this struggle has often been won by equity...
Despite all the talk about America losing its edge in the global market, programs for the gifted and talented are threatened on several fronts. There are fewer classes for gifted elementary and middle school children today than there were a decade ago. The federal No Child Left Behind law was "eroding support for gifted services." "It's important to help the kids who are struggling," Ms. Clarenbach said, "but it's important to challenge the kids on the other end, too."
These are troubled times in education, and even more troubled times in gifted education, with the narrow focus brought to education by NCLB.

Balancing these twin commitments, to equity and to excellence, is a challenge. But it is a nonnegotiable one if we are to become who we wish to be.

Being a gifted young learner should not mean you lose your right to a quality education.

Teachers should also notice pupils who are especially exceptional at the high end of the ability spectrum; they often need a different educational program than that offered to their more typical age-mates... Standardized [individual IQ and achievement] tests, can get a much better estimate of a pupil's standing in academic ability related to peers of his/her own age than is possible for a teacher to estimate using the more informal assessment procedures... Tracking (homogenous ability grouping) allows more pupils to receive more relevant instruction in keeping with their rate of progress during their time in school than when the teacher has to pitch the instruction mostly at just the average level of the pupils in a mainstream class, or when the teacher's attention and effort has to be divided between widely differing ability groups within the same classroom...

NCLB, as it is currently implemented, largely ignores another important group that is struggling -- gifted and talented students. Our society typically views struggling students as those who are disadvantaged by ability or demonstrated achievement level -- those students not meeting proficiency levels for their respective grade. Gifted and talented students struggle because they sit in our classrooms and wait. They wait for rigorous curriculum. They wait for opportunities to be challenged. They wait for engaging, relevant instruction that nurtures their potential. And, as they wait, these students lose interest in their passions, become frustrated and unmotivated from the lack of challenge their schools' curricula provide them. They become our lost talent...

Research on child prodigies in general and the cognitive-developmental theory of the child prodigy phenomenon in particular shed light on the nature of talent development and expertise acquisition. According to the theory, this phenomenon is a result of an exceptionally accelerated mental development during sensitive periods that leads to the fast growth of a child's cognitive resources and their construction into specific cognitive experience. This is how human expertise is acquired. The cognitive experience is a psychological basis of extraordinary intellectually creative achievements, which expresses itself in the prodigy's unique intellectual picture of the world. The psychological nature of the prodigy phenomenon is thus formed by the sensitive periods " which explain prodigious development and talent development " and by cognitive experience, which explains prodigies' exceptional performance and achievements...
