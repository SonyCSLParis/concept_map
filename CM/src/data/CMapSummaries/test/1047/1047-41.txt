Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child :
1.States Parties agree that the education of the child shall be directed to: (a) The development of the child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential;[...]].
The dramatic changes in our social and economic environment have pushed tuition into a top five global priority. The Internet, the free flow of labor force, financial crises, global warming and such like, spin each of our lives round on a daily basis. With each child there is a world to save; so child centered education looks like the only yellow brick road home.
Child centered education comes neither easy nor cheap. But at the end of the day, pay-off exceeds expectations, in terms of curbing risks (like teenage delinquency), pushing employment rates high and increasing labor and labor market quality, by plus creativity, plus motivation, plus teamwork spirit, social awareness, respect for craftsmanship... all such and more, as a result of plus education.
The community of the underage with special education needs are a growing population today, and hard core statistics show that their education costs less than to support them uneducated. Rational sharing of costs for specific special needs yield better education quality and generate specific projects, than can be ulteriorly implemented for general education. Special education is thus proven economically efficient, socially balancing, ethical at all times and a champion of education for all.
In many countries of the world, such minority goes up to a quite sizable percentage. On a Gaussian populace distribution curve, exceptional children may not go up to much; or, on the contrary, they can amount to a significant number, under special circumstances, due to increased hazard emigration, children on the street and in special care homes, dysfunctional families, or underprivileged children.
Gifted children may also not march in in large numbers; but they constantly prove invaluable to the labor market, being therefore entitled to special educational programs.
Although the present project is focused on the underprivileged who need special education, it can be extended to the whole of the underage population group, by the transfer of expertise and valid data thus begot, in esteem for the true educational unit of the educators' community, i.e. each child's unique exceptionality.
All formal tuition systems and schools need to find their ways in reaching each child, on a range from the least, to the best equipped for life. The consensus is launched for the exceptionalities to be placed within more or less homogeneous majorities, a concept generally known as inclusion. By generating the inclusive school and by practicing child centered pedagogy, inclusion is aimed at the success of each child, coming to terms with their personal (dis)abilities.
Not only do inclusive schools generate specific programs and quality education for all; but, equally important, but they also help generate friendly communities, curbing discrimination: an inclusive society may be the far end of educational success; hopefully not one too far. The realist thing to do for the schools aiming at inclusiveness is to allow and support them to be the best pilot projects in their areas, as they will develop the sanest expertise, which will progressively enlarge and disseminate as life will ask for, in a natural vital process.
Adequate funding needs be provided for the training of regular teachers in order to support "resource centers", as well as  resource teachers' and educators trained to teach special education in special education schools. Adequate logistics also need to be provided in an inclusive system: such major challange practically asks for all types of authority to contribute, local to central plus various intermediate.
Change of social prospect is imperative. For much too long have both the disabled and the (intensely) gifted been discriminated and confronted with a society focused on their being different rather than on their potential, thus disability, rather than success, being generated.
We still ignore how many (intensely) gifted we target. Our data say that about 20% of Romania's middle-school graduates do not make it into high school; and that over 50% of the high school juniors are functionally illiterate (see PISA report): enough to prove the imperativeness of reconsidering the concept of special educational needs, not only of the disabled or the gifted underage, but also " as complementary programs " for the statistic middle of Gaussian populace bell curve, i.e. about 60% of total school age students. Adding up an extra 10% of not registered, 2 to 4%, of gifted and intensely gifted, about 4% of deficient and a few others, an incredible minimum 75% of the total underage is reached, to define the target group of special educational programs.
It goes without saying that nonexistent inclusive education programs can only result in inefficient investment in education, no matter how large the investment. Targeting fulfillment of every child's potential, inclusive education is the solution to the problem defined as 75% of total graduates unprepared for the labor market; and as over 50% of the (over)gifted staying undeclared (underground) or performing as downright underachievers, clearly in bad need of style and topic specific educational programs and curricula.
We need to develop an efficient, skilled, moral, socialized, tolerant, expert, labor force for our future, by curbing school failure, regardless of its cause - cultural segregation (of the uprooted), poverty, geographical isolation or disability, social ousting or any other.
We need to educate all of our children for a friendly, tolerant and integrative society. Exsertion of human dignity and of human rights is measured by the degree to which a person acts in, and is accepted by, his or her community group; if the persons are underage, education respects their dignity and rights by equitably valorizing them through adequate educational strategies.
Future integration of these children into the labor market costs a lot less than supporting them under segregation, while valorization of the gifted yields huge economic benefit.
Worldwide technical cooperation and support agencies of education for all need to implement special education programs into each and every sustainable development projects.
We need to develop international standards for our telecommunication technologies, respectively their appurtenant infrastructure, in order that universal accessibility be granted to all.
