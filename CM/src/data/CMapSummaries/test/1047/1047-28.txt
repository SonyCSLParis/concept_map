A gifted or talented child can be found in any family and in almost any classroom.
Giftedness can be found in any culture, ethnic or socio-economic group. Their talents can be intellectual, emotional or physical, and appear at any age. A child with a disability can also be gifted.
Giftedness refers to a high intelligence or aptitude, while talented refers to a high level of performance in areas such as music, art, craft, dance or sport. Giftedness is inherited but a gifted child needs support to identify and develop their special abilities.
Most children need to repeat something 7-11 times to learn something new. A gifted child needs to repeat something in their areas of special ability just 1-3 times.
Some signs of giftedness include exceptional (amazing) use of language, an ability to concentrate on complex tasks for a long time, asking lots of questions, or being exceptionally coordinated.
Gifts or talents can be different within the context of ethnicity or culture. For example, Māori ideas of giftedness include personal qualities as well as abilities, and are grounded in Māori kaupapa.
Experts agree it is important to identify a gifted child to help them achieve their full potential. Schools can help identify a child who shows signs of giftedness or special talent.
If you think your child may have a special ability and they attend an early childhood centre, talk to their teacher. They can advise you about what to do next and provide contact details of those who can help if more support or information is needed.
