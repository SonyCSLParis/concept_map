The First Day of School for My Children

The first day of primary school must be a big day for children - or so we thought! But try asking them and you'll be surprised by what they tell you. After all, most kids in Singapore would have attended playschool, nursery or at least two years of kindergarten before they enter Pri 1.
Nevertheless, I have "prepared" not one but three daughters for the first day of primary school over the last seven years; they attended Pri 1 in 2007, 2003 and 2000. Let me share my experiences.
What was my youngest daughter's concern prior to her first day at primary school? As some of her classmates at kindergarten would be attending the same primary school, she was hoping they would be in the same class. "Networking" has now started early - at pre-school!
Come to think of it, this was exactly the main concern of her elder sibling who was going to Sec 1 - how many of her primary school mates would join her at the new school. As I see it, our children have moved on with the times. First-day anxiety or clinging on to mummy's arm probably happens only on the first day at nursery or kindergarten only.
In that respect, I can't over-emphasise the importance of attending pre-school. Why do we send our kids to pre-school? Is it to get them to read and write? No. That can be taught at home. It's about giving them the opportunity to socialise with other kids and the teachers.

We are introducing our kids to the real world in stages. Our little princes and princesses have to learn to share and respect other little princes and princesses. Learning to obey rules and take instructions from teachers is imperative at this age. This is the magic of pre-school. Picking up reading, numeracy and writing skills, which are essential for Pri 1, are the bonuses.
As my children had attended pre-school, the first day of primary school was rather a non-event for the kids. They were in fact more excited about the new bag and textbooks, besides getting new uniforms and a new pair of white shoes. Out went the pink Barbie sneakers and Powerpuff Girls bag. It's like they were coming of age. To quote one of my then six-year-old daughters, "This is real school, kindergarten is for babies!"
As to what was the most daunting task my kids had to face during the first few days of Pri 1, my three girls gave me the same reply and it was not what I expected! Their most difficult task: using money to buy food during recess. We had gone shopping on countless occasions but I had never consciously taught them how the purchases were paid for, and how money changed hands.
I realise now that this is an essential skill, which I had inadvertently overlooked with my girls, not once but three times. Fortunately, they picked up the skill in school like ducks to water!
What about other matters? Wouldn't kids be anxious at all on the first day of school? What about kids who throw tantrums or create a scene at school? To me, it could be because the kids had not attended pre-school or they were trying to get attention. Perhaps they felt bored or insecure.
Whatever the reasons, parents should bear responsibility. Some parents can be over-protective, consciously or not. Other parents may contend that their kids are too shy and allow them to sit in one corner to do their own things, without making any effort to socialise.
As I see it, however, shyness is a trap that kids get caught in and don't know how to get out of, and shy people miss out on many things. Thus, it is something well worth sorting out early on. Give the kids some space and you'll be surprised at how adaptable and independent they can be.
To many of us, our school years were the best part of our lives. Make sure that the tradition lives on with our children! Children can enjoy going to school. Even if it's not for the lessons, they enjoy the bonds of friendship with their peers.
