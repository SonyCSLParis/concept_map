Twitter @ Singlemomindebt My son is in 7th grade this year so it is different than when he was in younger grades - they don't do the holiday parties with room mothers. (one of my friends who's son goes to the school too is like that, they are married) I'm going to go out on a limb and say, i'm not the only single parent, BUT i did feel some kind of way about filling out my son's school forms. Now that he is gone and my little girl is in elementary school, I have been the only single parent in the class for the second school year in a row.
