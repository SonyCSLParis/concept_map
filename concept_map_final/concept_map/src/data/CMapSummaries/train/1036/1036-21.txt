Social science researchers suggest that around thirty percent of the population regularly experience the intense feelings of self-consciousness and shame associated with the experience of shyness.
For children, shyness can be especially painful and intense because of limits on their ability to filter and balance shy feelings against other, more positive social experiences. Shyness in children and teens can transform a classroom into an amplifier for self-criticism and negative thoughts, and an event like a piano recital into a dreaded nightmare anticipated weeks before the event.
"My whole childhood seemed like a series of painful social moments and mistakes," one young adult described of her shyness, "I always felt like I was broken in some way."
