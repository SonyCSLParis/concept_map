Enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids is the most common risk factor for OSA in children. It also appears that the inflammatory chemicals released by the body as a result of allergic rhinitis are also an important factor for the development of sleep apnea. When allergic rhinitis is a factor for children with sleep apnea, treatment with corticosteroid nasal sprays , and/or montelukast (Singulair) , can help reduce the symptoms of OSA.
