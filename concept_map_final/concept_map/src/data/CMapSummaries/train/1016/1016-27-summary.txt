At about 3 or 4 months of age, when the baby settles into a 24-hour sleep cycle, help her differentiate between day and night activities. For example, at about 8 or 10 months of age when a child may be experiencing separation anxiety, his sleep may be affected and he may need extra support. Don't you avoid a lot of problems if you let your child sleep in your bed?
