While this may not be convenient for the mother, she will then herself choose to sleep more during the day while the child sleeps, and learn to feed the baby in a lying position (safe in breastfed babies) in bed without having to get up to feed. A mother may put a child passing through this stage of sleep down on the bed with the impression that he has gone to sleep, but he is likely to get up soon after and start crying because he has not yet gone into a state of deep sleep. Allow the baby to sleep with a close relative or a maid during the day; this will make it easier for the child to sleep with such a person when the mother is not well or when the child must be weaned away from the mother during the night.
