About the Author
Frederick Burggraf began smoking as a teenager and smoked for 27 years before attempting to quit. His first and only attempt was successful, due in large part to the creative and large array of strategies he devised to get himself ready to quit and to support his campaign after his Quit Day.
After quitting smoking,
Mr. Burggraf served as a consultant to smoking cessation classes throughout Southern Maryland, working with Health Departments and Wellness Centers at hospitals. He also developed a workbook to help smokers get ready to quit, and he gave presentations to hospital staffs on how to approach quitting.
It was during these programs and presentations that he refined and enhanced his approach to quitting. Many of these ideas, strategies and techniques are included on this amazing card.
Also on this card:
Information about the nicotine patch, nicotine gum and other medical tools.
Information about the effects and dangers of smoking.
You'll meet "Nick the Negotiator," a name for that inner voice that tries to get you back to smoking again. You'll also learn how to silence Nick's voice.
This card is ideal for anyone who is thinking about quitting smoking, anyone who supports quitters in smoking-cessation programs, or any health professionals who would appreciate a rich and reliable resource on this topic.
