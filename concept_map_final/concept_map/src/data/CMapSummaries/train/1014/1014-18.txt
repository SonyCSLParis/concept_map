It is hard to believe that tomorrow will mark eight weeks without smoking. I just wanted to give you an update as to how I have been doing. Mostly, things have gone very well.
Physically, this is the best I have felt in twenty years. I have been going for walks and along the way will jog for a bit which isn't bad considering I turned 59 yesterday.
As an asthmatic I have used a puffer for most of my life. Naturally as a smoker I would have to use the puffer to clear my airways enough to smoke my next cigarette. Hard to believe.
People are proud of me and quite surprised. In closing I would like to say that it is your efforts which have put me in a position to succeed and I thank you for that.

Yesterday was my One Year Anniversary for quitting smoking!!! I want to thank you once again! I did not believe on that day that I would actually succeed; I was secretly sure that I would be one of the ones who would be quoting the "Money Back Guarantee" clause to you.
What is most remarkable is that I have actually forgotten about smoking. Last year, the thought of being left without cigarettes would fill me with dread, and I knew where all the 24 hour convenience stores where "just in case". I was prepared to try my best at it, but was sure that I even if I were able to, I was going to miss smoking, and that some enjoyment out of life would be gone. Instead, I have absolutely forgotten all about cigarettes! Occasionally, I see an empty pack of cigarettes littered on the road, or I see someone smoking and I think "Oh yeah, I used to smoke..."
As cigarettes are $9.00 a pack (I never bought cartons) I have saved about $3,000.00 in this last year. No more filthy ashtrays, my nagging cough has completely cleared up and I feel better and have more energy. Thank you so much for helping me to accomplish this!

I just thought I would drop you a line and thank you from the bottom of my heart for facilitating, promoting and ultimately guiding my way back form the dark pit that was my life smoking. I truly do feel like I have been given a new lease on life. So I just wanted to thank you for being the catalyst that helped me see the light once again. It has been 9 days and I really and truly cannot say that I suffered letting go of that nastiness. I feel so much better. My lungs and chest have opened up. It really feels so great that it is motivating me to not want to ever feel that way again.
By the way, your session on the 13th was so well done. You really do have a gift for the work that you are doing and it is a noble thing as well, because it helps people to re-gain a very precious gift. So, thanks again Damian.
I hope to send as many people as I possibly can to the program.

I attended the Easyway seminar one year ago on Sept 16, 2007 and quit smoking. When I consider the health benefits, it is a miracle enough, but then I considered the financial benefit of saving over $3,000 and the 7,300 cigarettes I have not smoked in the last year, it amazes me. Since I started smoking as a teenager, I estimate I must have smoked at least 250,000 cigarettes. That my body appears to have forgiven me is the biggest miracle of all. Thank you Nicole and Damian for your wonderful program and support.

Please use this message to support public recognition of Allen Carr's work.
Until two months ago, I had smoked more than a pack a day for more than forty years, apart from one period of about a year. Thanks to the EasyWay seminar you led, I am now completely cured of my addiction. Public recognition of Allen's work in this field would not only reward him for his contribution to society, but would also bring his work to the attention of all those who really want to quit but think that they can't.
