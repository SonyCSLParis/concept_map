If your daughter did not display this type of behavior before the divorce then you can be assured that she is having a hard time dealing with the change in her family. * The more you understand what your daughter is experiencing, the more compassion you will have for her and the easier it will be for you to step up to being the father she needs -- even if she doesn't realize it right now. Again, reminding her that she has every right to feel the way she does is important, but that you and her mother know that with time, she will come to understand that this new situation is best for all of you.
