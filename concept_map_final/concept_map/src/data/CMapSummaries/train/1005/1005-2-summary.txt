If you feel uncomfortable about something you see or something someone tells you, it's always a good idea to talk to an adult you trust (together we decided to report the playground kissing, without naming names, to the principal). Ten is not at all too young to have romantic feelings for someone, but it is very young to have exclusive relationships that leave out other friends. So, knowing the statistics you now know about young people and relationships and physical expressions of love, what do you think of my advice to my daughter?
