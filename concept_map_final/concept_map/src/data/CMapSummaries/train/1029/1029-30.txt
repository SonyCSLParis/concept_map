Let's face it, the drug epidemic among today's youth is getting worse. Half of all high-school seniors have used an illicit drug and fully a third of kids between the ages of seventeen and nineteen meet the criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependency. These tragedies can be averted if parents are empowered to prevent drug use, or to step in when a drug problem first appears.
What's a Parent To Do? by Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry David Abraham, M.D. bridges the knowledge gap between parent and child with a three-pronged approach: helping parents prevent drug/alcohol abuse before their kid gets involved; giving readers essential facts on every street drug - from tobacco to heroin - that puts their kids at risk and showing parents what steps to take if their child is already using drugs or alcohol.
What's a Parent To Do? is a clear, concise guide to what parents need to know about street drugs before their kids get involved-what the drugs are and what to do when dealing with the problems of a kid who uses or is addicted to drugs and alcohol. Real life anecdotes and illustrated tables reinforce how to cope, and each chapter closes with "Take-Home Lessons" summarizing key points readers need to know when dealing with a particular aspect of kids' drug/alcohol problems.
The battle to stop the epidemic of drug use among the young begins at home. Prevention works. Treatment works. Abraham shows how parents can make the difference.
