PARENTS! DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS... to these questions kids have about DRUGS?
EDITOR JOHN S. DUFF PRINTED AS A PUBLIC SERVICE BY NARCONON INTERNATIONAL ISSUE VII
Have you ever wondered what to say if your child asks you "How do people get addicted to drugs?" or "Why do people take drugs?" or "If mommy and daddy drink will it hurt them?" Do you know what the most popular drug in America is and ... how it is made? Narconon established its Truth About Drugs educational program in 1979. This program provides the true facts about drugs that impact a person's decision to not take them.
How to Handle these Questions about Drugs
The effectiveness of this unique approach and the increased demand for the program are well documented. Over 250,000 surveys from satisfied youth and adults clearly show the truly effective nature of this program.
True education on the facts is the only way a child will know what they are saying "NO" to and why. Lack of understanding of the truth about alcohol and other drugs has prevented proper education on the subject until now.
Breaking the Barriers
Bobby Wiggins, one of Narconon's top specialists, has been educating children and adults for over 12 years. His skillful approach has resulted in some of the most dynamic presentations about drugs ever developed.
Talking to kids about drugs can be a tough job, even for a skilled professional. Narconon broke this barrier of presenting the truth about drugs to kids from 2nd through 12th grade.
Now you can see these fun, educational and exciting presentations for the first time on video. You will be amazed at the impact they have on your child's decision to not do drugs.
Narconon (narcotics-none or no-drugs) is a public benefit, non-profit, tax-exempt organization. Narconon utilizes the drug-free method developed by American author and humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard. This, along with the experience of Narconon, is the real secret behind the program's outstanding success.
"I learned that by using drugs I am not going to get anywhere, so I promise I'm not going to use drugs never because if! use drugs I'Il never reach my goals." R.B
"Drugs make people stupid, high, don't want to do anything. Drugs are making our world fall apart. I wish one day everyone will be drug free. I really wish." H.S.
"After listening to the Narconon lecture I know that drugs are not an answer to problems, they only make them worse in the long run." J.K.
The Truth Gets Results
The Foundation for Advancement in Science and Education (FASE) did an independent study of Narconon's Truth about Drugs educational program.
FASE set out to measure the attitude change of students from the 2nd through 12th grade after hearing a Narconon Truth About Drugs presentation.

Let's Face the Facts
Our children are confronted with negative influences on a daily basis. Examples of these are peer pressure, false information from others and the glamorization of alcohol by the media.
Despite efforts to educate our children about drugs the problem continues to escalate at an alarming rate, with 3 out of 5 school-age kids trying alcohol and other drugs each year!
Parents have no choice but to take matters into their own hands now, before it is too late.
