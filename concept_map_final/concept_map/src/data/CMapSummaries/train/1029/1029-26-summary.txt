Talking To Your Kids About Drugs Parents often fear that if they discuss a subject like sex or drugs with their child that will push them towards the behavior. The more informed you are the easier it is to talk about it. Open communication with your child will increase the chance that your child won't do drugs and if they do use drugs that they will come to you for help.
