By the way, if you're going to the doctor with your child, call them ahead of time and say, "If I were to bring in my child who is addicted to alcohol and marijuana, what would your approach be?" Take responsibility for your actions as a parent and dont try to blame everything on drugs you need to get your kids off drugs but blaming problems in a childs life on drugs will only insult the child especially if the problems started before the drugs and the child will never take what you say about drugs seriously or realise the dangers because they will know what the real problem is and your words will be worthless, a child will not listen to someone they have no respect for. He is only 14 the only thing I could think to tell him was he had the rest of his life to make mistakes but don't make ones like this, I really didn't know what to say.
