[Lindsay Brown] I don't want to go to the hassle, if he trusts me, because the people that I think it would become useful to is people who don't trust their kids, who can't get the truth out of them, who don't know what's going on in their lives and stuff, but he knows what's going on in my life and we have 100% trust so it's not really something that will be valuable to me personally or to my parents really. We wanted to say these are options, these are things that can be done, you know, whether it's some resource in the community or at the referral back to school for us to help that child. We feel that there's are a lot of parents out there that don't realize their son or daughter is using drugs and alcohol and by -- if indeed a positive test comes up, at least the parent is aware now that their son or daughter has a problem with the use of drugs and alcohol.
