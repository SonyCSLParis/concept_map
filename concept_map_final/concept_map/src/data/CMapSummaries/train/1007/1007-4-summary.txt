Consciously we can rationalise that we should not be so afraid but our unconscious is taking over and protecting us from something we think is ultimately going to kill us. If a parent is afraid of spiders then a child can learn that fear and it could develop into a phobia. The most common phobias I work with are social phobia, fear of flying, spiders and needles, but the processes are effective for other phobias too.
