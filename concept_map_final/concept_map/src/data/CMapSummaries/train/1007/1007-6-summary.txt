Lots of people are afraid of things for example, most of us fear heart surgery,  notes David Schwendeman, M.D., a psychiatrist at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network. If they have a phobia about flying, for example, some people take medication or alcohol getting on the plane. You have to look at whether a fear interferes with your day-to-day functioning or pleasures in life,  Schwendeman says.
