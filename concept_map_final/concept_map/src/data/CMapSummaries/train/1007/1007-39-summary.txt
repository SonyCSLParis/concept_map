The important point is realising that overcoming a fear doesn't have to include learning to love or even to like the objects of fear, but to learn to be able to handle the situation without any difficulties. It is not easy to face the fear and deal with it, but being constantly surrounded by the shadow of fear would be even more frightening and painful. It'll take a long time for me to make bugs my favourite friends, but for now, I'm able to thank them for scaring me enough to go on to open my door and overcome a fear.
