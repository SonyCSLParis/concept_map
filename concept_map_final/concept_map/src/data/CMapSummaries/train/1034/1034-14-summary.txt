You'd want to be sure that the students could understand the game; it would have to be age appropriate in content and also appropriate to the reading levels of those students who are being considered for the game. I don't think games should become a huge part of the instructional activities; I think they should be just one more way of learning for students, one more way of understanding that learning is fun, too. But now, not only do some of my older adult students have children who are gamers, they themselves are also gamers, and they're much more able to accept that there could be a place for games in learning settings.
