ORTON-GILLINGHAM (US) The Institute for Multi-Sensory Education (IMSE) has developed a program to empower parents to give their children a head start on the basics of reading, to support beginning readers, and to assist children who are struggling with the reading process. The Orton-Gillingham method is language-based and success-oriented. The student is directly taught reading, handwriting and written expression as one logical body of knowledge. Learners move step by step from simple to more complex material in a sequential, logical manner that enables students to master important literacy skills.

TEXTHELP (Worldwide) This computer program sits alongside a normal word-processor, like 'Office', and helps the child or student to find spellings as they type. There is a small box on the screen which attempts to guess each word as the person starts to type it. For example, if you type in 'b', it will come up with a list of words you have used before beginning with 'b', like big, better, beginning, etc. If one of these is the word you need, you can select it, and the word will go straight into where you are typing.
As you type more letters, the guesses get better. At the end of each session you are asked to save your spellings so that the program can begin to learn your particular vocabulary and make better guesses based on the words you use most frequently.
It can also read out what you have written so far - a very popular feature with children - so that you can hear if you have missed out any words or put in a wrong word. There are two versions - TextHelp Read and Write and Type and Talk. You can see details at TextHelp . Highly recommended. (John Bradford) (More comments/reviews welcome)
