About this Book
Sixteen years ago I became a Waldorf school parent. At that time, I was an unlikely character for this role. A teacher who comes from a long line of educators, including both my parents, I had come of age in the 1960s. I believed education should be as painless as possible and, while being fun, should still be excellent. My educational philosophy vacillated between A. S. Neills Summerhill and the works of Maria Montessori. One thing was clear to my husband and me: we were determined to raise our children without hang-ups. At the same time, we wanted them to be brilliant, artistic, practical and wholesome. I was an advocate of early learning. To have a child who reads at age four seemed to be a desirable and measurable step on the way to budding genius. Thus, I was dutiful in my efforts to help my children to read through the gospel of Sesame Street. Even though I found the speed and flashiness of this program hard to digest (Mr. Rogers was more my style), I assumed my reticence was due to some weakness in my own upbringing, so I was vigilant in seeing that my toddler received a proper diet of televisioneducational only, of course. The fact that these programs were on in the late afternoon and early eveninga mothers most harried time of dayincreased the attractiveness of the products of The Childrens Television Workshop. How, then, did we end up at a Waldorf school? With a fervor peculiar to parents of first and only children, I investigated preschools as though my daughters life depended on it. With a new son strapped to my back, I tried to leave no stone unturned as I dragged my small girl from interview to interview in school after school. One thing was clear to me. She was immediately and most comfortable in a Waldorf classroomâ€¦. -Margaret Gorman
