In this briefing, we have attempted to distil some of the arguments made for and against ethics classes. (However, while parents should only be offered a place in ethics classes after they have indicated that they wish to withdraw their child from SRE, the implementation guidelines for ethics classes expect that all parents will be notified that ethics classes are available at the school.) Essentially it argues that if SEE classes are beneficial for children (as the St James Ethics Centre and the NSW government believes they are), then all children should have the opportunity to attend them.
