One of a number of factors contributing to this feeling is the heavy handed approach taken by Paul Ramsey, the minister of Education, with respect to the Personal Planning component of the CAPP program now offered in all public schools in the province. In spite of Mr. Ramsey's rhetoric about how much 'choice' there is in public education in B.C., the highly controversial CAPP program is now mandatory for high school graduation, leaving no options for parents, or students for that matter, who have reservations about the content and direction this program takes. In the meantime, traditional religious people in this province are nervously reading many different signs coming out of Victoria and wondering whether we are not now entering a new era of religious persecution, one in which traditional religious voices are to be increasingly and aggressively marginalized and stifled by the provincial government.
