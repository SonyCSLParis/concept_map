If the teachers and Nursery School Director feel that our School cannot meet the needs of the child for any reason, the School reserves the right to require that the child be removed from the School. The Jewish Center may also discontinue your child's enrollment at any time it determines that your child is not benefiting from the program or that a parent or a child's behavior is detrimental to the well-being of the other students, parents or teachers. As the parent of a preschooler, you might, from time to time, need to speak with your child's teacher about a special concern.
