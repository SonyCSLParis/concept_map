OTTAWA, May 13, 2009 - The Catholic Civil Rights League supports the right of parents to direct the education of their children, and in particular to choose the religious education of their children. At one high school in Granby, six students were suspended from all classes for boycotting the course. The only difference is that the private religious schools may also teach religious education of their choice in addition to the course in Ethics and Religious Culture.
