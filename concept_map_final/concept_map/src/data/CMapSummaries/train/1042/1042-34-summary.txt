Posted: December 12, 2003 Is the Anti-Defamation League trying to "censor Christmas"? A Christmas concert dominated by religious carols, Christian music in the school office, and a creationism video in science class with a theological message are not reflective of religious neutrality, but instead appear to be school endorsement of the Christian religion. Consequently, promotion of religious views, such as that which took place in this Colorado public school, is inconsistent with the guarantees of religious liberty in the First Amendment
