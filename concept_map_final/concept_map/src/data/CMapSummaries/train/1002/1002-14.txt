BabyMo cellphone; you know, for kids!

Now that your young'un can toddle about and even produce a few words, it's time to consider equipping them with that most modern of conveniences, a cellphone. You just so happen to be in luck: the BabyMo from Communic8 is a simple device for 4 to 8 year olds that allows them to keep in touch with their parents.
The BabyMo isn't the first cellphone aimed at kids, but 4 year olds are somewhat younger than the audience targeted by other children's phones, like the Firefly . I've worked with kids before, and I have a number of young cousins, and even though they like to play with toy cellphones, I'm not sure I'd want to give them a real one. For one thing, it conveys an air of adultness that I don't think they're ready for ("Oh, we can leave Suzy alone for an hour; she's got her cellphone!"), and for another, the jury is still out on the dangers of cellphone radiation; while they may not be harmful to adults, children are always more sensitive.
