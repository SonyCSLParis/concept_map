Speaking at the opening of the Cancer Association of SA (Cansa) new science and resource centre in Mowbray, Dr Davra Davis warned that children were more vulnerable than adults to the radiation produced by cellphones. She warned that the studies had shown children were particularly vulnerable to brain tumours and hearing problems because the cellphone signals penetrated deeper into their brains. If we are to invest in our children''''s health, we need to act now," she said, urging the South African government to consider policies that warned against the use of cellphones by children.
