And I have only one Tv, in the den, so that the kids will hang out with me as a family. I got a TV in my room when I was 26. Always enjoy reading about your family and I'm so very glad you had such a great Christmas!I have four kids and when they were growing up there were no cell phones, there was one TV and it was in the living room.
