If a bully is on a playground, a school bus, or a teenage dance in front of another kid or teen then at least he/she is recognizable. And you can see them as young as 13 and 14 years old going around doing their texting thing, in the malls, waiting at the bus stop, even at school or wherever kids hang out. Teachers should have the authority to take the cellphone and hold it for a period of time (punishment) if a student is found to use it in the class, the parents should be called and informed.
