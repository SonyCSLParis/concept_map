From pushes on the playground to mean instant messaging, bullying is an issue that almost all children face at some time or another. With a recent surge in media attention and a new focus on cyber-bullying , parents may wonder where and how to find the best information and ways of talking to their own kids about bullies.
What if my child is the victim of bullying?
A recent article in Parenting magazine offered the following 3 Step process for parents:
Step One : Find out what's going on.  Get the facts and reassure your child that you will both work together on a solution.
Step Two : Help your child figure out how to respond.  Some responses include:
Stand tall and act brave
Ignore the bully
Stick with friends
Tell an Adult
Step Three :  Take action yourself.  Set up a meeting with the teacher, parent, or caregiver.
What if my child's friend is the bully?
One of the hardest things for a child to learn is how to stand up for what's right, even in the face of possible scrutiny or embarassment.
The US Department of Health and Human Services has a kid-friendly website called Stop Bullying Now that features info, games, quizzes, and webisodes all designed to address the issues of bullying , offer meaningful discussion starters, and help promote positive ways of combatting this childhood problem.  Check out this video featuring the character Melanie and her struggle with a friend who is a known bully.
What if my child is the bully?
It can sometimes be hard to tell if childhood squabbles are simply "kids being kids" or if there is a more serious problem.
Make it clear to your child that you take bullying seriously and that you will not tolerate this behavior.
Develop clear and consistent rules within your family for your children's behavior. Praise and reinforce your children for following rules and use non-physical, non hostile consequences for rule violations.
Spend more time with your child and carefully supervise and monitor his or her activities. Find out who your child's friends are and how and where they spend free time.
Build on your child's talents by encouraging him or her to get involved in prosocial activities (such as clubs, music lessons, nonviolent sports).
Share your concerns with your child's teacher, counselor, or principal. Work together to send clear messages to your child that his or her bullying must stop.
If you or your child needs additional help, talk with a school counselor or mental health professional.
The Children's Library also offers some great books for both children and parents on the subject of bullying.  These are a few of our favorites:
