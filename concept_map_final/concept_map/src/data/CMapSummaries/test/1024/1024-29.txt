Beyond Viruses & Downloads: Safety from Bullies &amp; Cyber-Bullies
Bullying can be contagious and can lead to broken friendships, broken bones, and even loss of life. It's not a joke and it's not funny. The purpose of bullying is to skew the balance of power and make the victim feel helpless. Bullying is reoccurring and often includes an intent to cause harm. However, there are instances when the intent is subconscious and because of an inner turmoil, the bully is lashing out in a futile attempt to regain power.
There are several types of bullying and these types often intertwine and progress, if not stopped. The most common forms that bullying takes is Verbal, Social, Physical, and the most recent form, Cyberbullying. Verbal bullying involves name calling and teasing. This is usually the least recognized form of bullying because the bully does not often see the physiological pain that is being inflicted. Social bullying occurs when rumors are spread, intentional alienation occurs, and friendships are destroyed. Physical bullying is often the most recognized form of bullying and includes hitting, kicking, shoving, and tripping. As mentioned, cyberbullying is the newest advancement in bullying and occurs via technology. Examples of Cyberbullying include fake profiles on a social media account, harassing texts and messages, falsely editing pictures of the victim in order to embarrass, etc.
There are three parties involved in Bullying. There is the Victim, the Bully, and the Bystander. Although the Bystander may not be directly involved, this party is especially important because this is the audience. The audience encourages the Bully, adds fuel to the metaphorical fire, and bares witness to the act of humility of the Victim. Any party can end the bullying by seeking help. Most schools have a Zero Tolerance for bullying and can provide the resources necessary to remedy the situation.
Now the only thing to ask... Are you the Victim? Are you the Bystander? Are you the Bully? And, what are you going to do about it?
