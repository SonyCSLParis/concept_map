This matrix identifies best practices that have been associated with risk factors, lists suggested or sample strategies and identifies guiding principles. The best practices are hyperlinked to the resource sheets. The ( Example: ) programs underlined in blue are linked to sites or documents regarding those programs. This matrix was co-developed with support from Central CAPT and The Wisconsin Clearinghouse for Prevention Resources.
Community norms-the attitudes and policies a community holds about drug use and crime-are communicated in a variety of ways: through laws, written policies, through informal practices, and through the expectations parents and other members of the community have of young people.
Correct misperceptions about the prevalence of use in conjunction with other educational approaches
Transitions and Mobility
Even normal school transitions predict increases in problem behaviors. When children move from one elementary school to middle or from middle to high school, significant increases in the rate of drug use, school misbehavior, and delinquency result. Communities with high rates of mobility appear to be linked to an increased risk for drugs and crime.
Provide positive alternatives to help youth in high-risk environments develop skills
Provide opportunities to practice new skills
Involve parents in school-based approaches (Safe and Sound-Milwaukee www.safesound.org )
Provide transportation to prevention programs
Increase positive attitudes through community service
Low Neighborhood Attachment / Community Disorganization
Higher rates of drug problems, juvenile delinquency, and violence occur in communities or neighborhoods where people have little attachment to the community, where rates of vandalism are high, and where there is low surveillance of public places. These conditions are not limited to low income neighborhoods; they can also be found in wealthier neighborhoods
Promote involvement in positive youth oriented school and community organizations and activities
Provide positive alternatives for high risk youth
Extreme Economic Deprivation
Children who live in deteriorating and crime ridden neighborhoods characterized by extreme poverty are more likely to develop problems with delinquency, teen pregnancy, school dropout, and violence. Children who live in these areas-and have behavior and adjustments problems early in life-are also more likely to have problems with drugs later on.
If children are raised in a family with a history of addiction to alcohol or other drugs, the risk of having alcohol and other drugs themselves increases. If children are born or raised in a family with a history of criminal activity the risk of juvenile delinquency increases, Similarly, children raised by a teenage mother are more likely to be teen parents, and children of dropouts are more likely to drop out.
Provide positive alternatives to help youth in high risk environments develop personal and social skills ( Zibi Quest or Project Venture Menomonee )
Strengthen the bonds between adults and youth and provide opportunities for positive community involvement (Example: Across Ages )

Communicate peer norms against use
Family Management Problems
The risk factor has been shown to increase the risk of drug abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school dropout, and violence. Poor family management practices include lack of clear expectations of behavior, failure of parents to monitor their children (knowing where they are and who they are with), and excessively severe or inconsistent punishment.
Provide programs that strengthen social competence and problem solving (Example: Incredible Years )
Provide "wraparound"services for students with intensive needs (Milwaukee Joining Forces)

Family Conflict
Persistent, serious conflict between primary caregivers or between caregivers and children appear to enhance risk for children raised in these families. Conflict between family members appears to be more important than structure.
Provide skill based programs for youth who may be dealing with grief, loss, or divorce (Example: Children in the Middle )
Target the entire family
Emphasize family bonding
Employ strategies to overcome parental resistance to family-based programs
Provide positive alternatives to help youth in high risk environments develop personal and social skills
Promote new skills in family communication through interactive techniques
Improve family functioning through family therapy where indicated
Parent Attitudes and Involvement in Drug Use, Crime and Violence
Parental attitudes and behavior toward drugs, crime, and violence influence the behavior of their children. Parental approval of young people's moderate drinking, even under parental supervisions, increases the risk of the young person using marijuana. Similarly, children of parents who excuse their children for breaking the law are more likely to develop problems with juvenile delinquency.
Boys who are aggressive in grades K-3 are at higher risk of substance abuse and juvenile delinquency. When aggressive behavior is combined with isolation or withdrawal, there is even a greater risk of problems in adolescence. The risk applies to aggressive behavior combined with hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder. Persistent antisocial behavior like misbehaving in school, skipping school and getting into fights with other children appears to increase risk for drug abuse, violence, dropout, and teen pregnancy.
Beginning in late elementary grades, academic failure increases the risk of drug abuse, delinquency, violence, pregnancy and school dropout. Children fail for many reasons. It appears that the experience of failure-not necessarily ability- increases the risk of problem behavior.
Low commitment to school means the young person has ceased to see the role of student as a viable one. Young people who have lost this commitment to school are at higher risk for substance abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, and school dropout.
Young people who feel they are not part of society, bound by rules, don't believe in trying to be successful or responsible, or who take an active rebellious stance toward society, are at higher risk of drug abuse, delinquency, and school dropout.
Restructure the existing school environment to reduce opportunities and rewards for bullying (Example: Olweus Bullying Program )

Cite immediate consequences
Avoid relying solely on knowledge-oriented intervention designed to supply information about negative consequences
Friends Who Engage in The Problem Behavior
Young people who associate with peers who engage in problem behavior, delinquency, substance abuse, violent activity, sexual activity or school dropout-are much more likely to engage in the same behavior.
Increase community involvement in promoting the healthy development of youth and the valuing of adolescents
Improve youth identification with positive roles (Mentor/Tutors School District of Janesville )
Provide structured time with adults through mentoring (Example: Big Brothers Big Sisters Dane County )

Structure alternative activities and supervise alternative events
Design intensive alternative activities that include a variety of approaches and time commitment
Avoid relying solely on knowledge-oriented interventions
Favorable Attitudes Toward The Problem Behavior
During the elementary years, children usually express anti-drug, anti-crime and pro-social attitudes. They have difficulty imagining why people use drugs, commit crimes, and drop out of school. However, in middle school, as others they know participate in such activities, their attitudes often shift toward greater acceptance of these behaviors. This acceptance places them at higher risk
Utilize both cognitive sophistication and cognitive dissonance approaches (Example: Sticks n' Stones )
Provide opportunities for youth to increase their understanding and beliefs about substance abuse
Provide a program where youth can learn the consequences of using drugs and develop their own reasons not to use. (Example: Keep A Clear Mind )
Utilize goal setting to increase motivation to avoid drug use (Example: All-Stars )
Utilize peer mediation and peer helper programs
Target the entire family
Provide positive alternative to help youth in high-risk environments develop personal and social skills
Design culturally sensitive interventions targeting youth involved in tribal or alternative
Incorporate problem identification and referral into prevention programs
Communicate peer norms against use
Cite Immediate consequences
Avoid relying solely on knowledge-oriented interventions
Combine information dissemination and media campaigns with other interventions
Early Initiation of The Problem Behavior
The earlier young people begin using drugs, committing crimes, engaging in violent activity, dropping out of school, and becoming sexually active, the greater the likelihood that they will have problems with these behaviors later on. For example, research shows that young people who initiate drug use before the age of 15 are at twice the risk of having drug problems as those who wait until after the age of 19.
Counter the effects of deviant norms and behaviors by creating an environment for youth with behavior problems to interact with other non problematic youth
Improve family functioning through family therapy where indicated
Strengthen the bonds between adults and youth and provide opportunities for positive community involvement
Cite immediate consequences
Avoid relying solely on knowledge-oriented interventions
Constitutional Factors
Constitutional factors are factors that may have a biological or physiological; basis. These factors are often seen in young people with behaviors such as sensation-seeking, low harm-avoidance, and lack of impulse control. These factors appear to increase the risk of young people abusing drugs, engaging in delinquent behavior, and or committing violent acts.
