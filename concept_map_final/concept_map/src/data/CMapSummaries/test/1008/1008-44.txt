Although most domestic violence victims * who seek assistance from local domestic violence programs do not need emergency shelter, far too many do. For those fleeing an abusive partner, finding a safe and supportive refuge for themselves and their children is critically important. In most cases, domestic violence shelter staff and volunteers work hard to create and maintain a "home-like" feel for the families that come to a shelter and a shared sense of communal living among shelter residents. Some programs are able to offer individual rooms with private bathrooms for residents, while others may have two or three families sharing a room or a suite of rooms with a common bathroom. Typically, a shelter has other common areas where residents prepare and eat meals, play with their children, watch TV, use a computer if one is available, and socialize.
Sharing living space with others is difficult under the best of circumstances and conflicts are inevitable - anyone who has grown up in a large family or shared an apartment with others knows this first hand! But group living is particularly challenging when you are sharing communal space with strangers who, like you and your children, are living in real fear, are unsure of the future, and are recovering from the trauma of domestic violence.
While advocates working in shelter programs are expected to build a community and manage a household of women and children from diverse backgrounds and circumstances, many may not receive the necessary training to resolve the types and intensity of conflicts that may arise within the shelter. Such training should equip advocates to better identify, understand and respond to the many challenges associated with communal living, including those described in Meeting Survivors' Needs: A Multi-State Study of Domestic Violence Shelter Experiences, discussed in more detail below.
In order to help address the training and technical assistance needs of domestic violence advocates, the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence (NRCDV) developed this brief collection on Conflict Resolution Tools and Resources for Domestic Violence Shelter Staff. Building on the findings from the Meeting Survivors' Needs study, this online collection includes selected materials and resources intended to equip advocates with a contextual framework and practical skills to better resolve conflicts that often arise within a shelter environment. A full set of publications related to Meeting Survivors' Needs: A Multi-State Study of Domestic Violence Shelter Experiences can be found on VAWnet, including the Research in Brief, Executive Summary, and Final Report, as well as Webinar materials, a Shelter Study FAQ, and related resources.
The NRCDV provides a wide range of free, comprehensive, and individualized technical assistance, training, and specialized resource materials and projects designed to enhance current intervention and prevention strategies. To suggest other resources we should include in this collection or for ongoing technical assistance or other resources, please contact the NRCDV's Technical Assistance Team at 800 -537-2238 (ext 5), TTY: 800-553-2508, or nrcdv@pcadv.org.
* A note about language: Because most domestic violence victims are women abused by a male partner, and most residents of domestic violence shelters are women and their children, we will use "she" and "woman" when referring to a victim of domestic violence. Also, the term "victim" is used here instead of "survivor" to serve as a reminder of the violence and control faced by women in abusive relationships seeking services from a domestic violence shelter. All victims of domestic violence, regardless of their gender or the gender of their abusive partner, deserve safety and advocacy.
Meeting Survivors' Needs: Implications of Issues Raised by Survivors | Back to top
The recently published Meeting Survivors' Needs: A Multi-State Study of Domestic Violence Shelter Experiences 1 (hereafter referred to as the Shelter Study) captured the voices and experiences of over 3,400 shelter residents in 215 programs across 8 states. One section of the Shelter Study focused on the kinds of problems encountered by the shelter residents and the extent to which these problems were resolved. While the overall rating of shelter experiences was very positive, many did encounter problems.
As the Final Report describes, "[s]helter residents often face a variety of problems and challenges, attributable partly to the sudden change in circumstances, living in close proximity with other families, the crisis that led them to seek shelter, and attending to their children's reactions. Challenges include finding privacy, getting along with other residents, and complying with shelter rules. During the approximately thirty years that shelters have existed, rules have been developed to help ensure the safe and smooth operation of the shelter, such as those prohibiting the use of drugs or alcohol and shelter curfews. Some specific rules were developed in response to particular incidents, such as those related to disciplining children while at the shelter. Respondents to this survey were asked about a variety of problems that the literature and the experience of advocates suggest are possible in shelters. They were also asked whether or not the problem had been resolved" ( Lyon, Lane &amp; Menard, 2008, p. 83 ).
Conflicts with other residents and staff, as the table below highlights, are among the main challenges identified by survivors accessing emergency shelter, affecting three in ten survivors (32%). It is important to note that respondents also reported that three-quarters (73%) of the conflicts that arose were resolved, with some respondents indicating that the problem was "resolved almost immediately once communicated to staff" (Lyon et al., 2008, p. 85 ). Resolution was less frequent for some of the other problems encountered.

The data in this table is discussed in detail in Lyon et al. (pp. 83-88), and included in the Webinar materials found on VAWnet.
These findings led Dr. Eleanor Lyon, the Shelter Study's Principal Investigator, to conclude that: "Staff training in conflict resolution, while common in programs across the country, might be offered more frequently or widely. Given the frequency of reports of conflicts with other residents, training or other approaches with shelter residents might also be worth program consideration."
In Susan Schechter's Women and Male Violence: The Visions and Struggles of the Battered Women's Movement, one advocate described the ups and downs of shelter life this way: "Fights blow up. Tensions come out around cleaning and disciplining kids, but they often are about anger, hurt and loneliness. We have a house meeting after a blow-up; there is enormous support. Women say, 'We're upset; I went through what she's going through, too.' Discussions bring the women back together. It's the best part of the shelter" ( Schechter, 1982, p. 92 ). With training and ongoing support from supervisors and peers, advocates can learn techniques and enhance skills to more effectively and confidently manage conflict situations within the shelter in a positive, creative and productive manner.
Entering the Shelter For many victims of domestic violence, leaving their homes and communities to enter a domestic violence shelter, usually with small children, no transportation, and little to no income, is extremely difficult. Victims and their children are likely coping with the recent, direct effects of the abuse and isolation to which they have been subjected. As they join other families in the shelter, differences in coping styles, eating preferences and habits, ideas about personal hygiene and approaches to housekeeping, as well as child rearing and discipline, can create fertile ground for conflicts to arise. Differences in race, ethnicity, and class, as well as languages and communication styles used - along with the temporary nature of living in the shelter - can all lead to misunderstandings and disagreements. As one Shelter Study respondent observed: "Community living-multiple personalities put in a living situation, some will get along well with others, some won't" ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 84 ). Conflicts can arise not only among shelter residents, but also between shelter staff and residents, and between staff members who disagree on how best to work with and advocate for individual survivors.
Settling In and Adjustment
In an emotionally nurturing, solutions-focused environment, residents can be enormously supportive to one another and provide companionship, humor and validation. Indeed, Shelter Study surveys completed by victims as they were entering the shelter indicated that 90% wanted support from other women. For women who have suffered in silence with issues of violence and coercive control in their lives, feeling free to talk about their experiences in the communal living environment offered at the shelter and women's support groups can be very liberating. If leaving their abusive partner or speaking out about the violence has resulted in the loss of some of all of their social support system, relationships with other shelter residents and shelter staff take on added power and importance. For individual residents, there may be a strong need for these new relationships to be successful, which can be emotionally reassuring to them at this tumultuous time. The Shelter Study found that the longer a woman stayed at the shelter, the more likely she was to indicate feeling more comfortable talking about things that bothered her ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 13 ).
Experience tells us some women adjust and settle very quickly into life at the shelter. The shelter may be the most stable environment some families have had for an extended period of time, and these families may become familiar much more quickly with what is available and the structures and supports that are in place to keep the house running smoothly. They may build strong relationships with the staff as well as other residents. Sometimes they may begin to feel so at home at the shelter that they become proprietary over the bathroom, kitchen, and other shared spaces.
We also know that constantly introducing new families into the shelter can prove challenging, particularly when new residents arrive with different ideas, or need a longer period of time to adjust and understand the "culture" at the shelter or the realities of communal living. Residents who are more settled, comfortable in their routine, and pleased with the current group living dynamic may view newcomers as problematic. Further, in small communities and amongst communities with close-knit or culturally-defined groups, shelter residents may have prior histories and experiences apart from the shelter that may bring conflict into the group living environment.
One particular source of conflict reported by participants in the Shelter Study involved the challenge of finding privacy, with 16% indicating that this was a problem.
Many noted that having children in the shelter added to privacy problems. 'It's hard to go somewhere and concentrate because kids are running around.' Others commented on the capacity of the shelter. 'There is just never totally private space here -- it is offered but it is many times full' and 'Sometimes the bath is the only place to get some peace, but that's not much peace because you have to be mindful of your housemates.' Forty-seven percent of these problems were resolved. 'Sometimes [it was a problem], but just going to the park would allow me the space I needed to get.' 'Own room to 'hide' in when necessary.' " ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 85-86 )
Clearly, this is an area in which staff can provide support to residents during their shelter stay to help avoid understandable interests in privacy from becoming the source of conflict.
Issues related to Children and Parenting
As indicated earlier, another common source of conflict in shelter arises around children, especially different approaches to parenting and expectations of parents. The Shelter Study found that, " Child discipline issues included problems with other residents' child monitoring. As one [shelter resident] complained, 'Some parents left other parents to discipline and monitor their kids." Another observed the following:
At times I felt there [was] little or no discipline. I felt some of the children in this home at times were totally out of control with parents taking advantage of everything good that this home represents and also so much disrespect to the other people and staff. I love children and do understand they are just that...children. As far as I am concerned there is no excuse for certain parents.
Others felt there was a lack of services that would allow for child monitoring: 'I cannot do chores and watch my children at the same time '" ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 87 ).
Domestic violence shelters quite commonly prohibit physical discipline or the use of corporal punishment in the shelter. At the same time, there is an expectation that children will play together, share toys and games, behave and interact positively, attend school and stay focused on their studies, and learn new ways of coping and being. Shelter Study participants often commented on "...these restrictive rules on discipline-particularly the common shelter prohibition against corporal punishment. One commented that 'my children wanted to run over me because they knew they couldn't be spanked.' Another wrote that 'he is my child and I should be able to spank if I want.'" Only 66% percent of these problems were resolved ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 87 ).
"Time-out" or "cool-down periods" are techniques often offered as alternatives to corporal punishment. However, both may be unfamiliar to both mother and child, and may not be culturally appropriate for a given family. "Time-out" is a discipline technique based largely on a white, middle class mindset, which is often represented by those in positions of power at domestic violence programs. However, "time-out" in a culture that does not value time by a clock might seem a foreign concept. Or within communities where discipline is typically stricter, aggressive, and very active, use of "time-outs" may be viewed as lax, passive, and ineffective. Sometimes, as indicated by Shelter Study participant comments above, when children realize that physical discipline cannot be used, they may actively test this new boundary with their parent, with other adult residents, and with staff.
Within the shelter environment, children of different ages may disclose different degrees of exposure to domestic violence or even child abuse and will demonstrate varying levels of post-traumatic stress along with a wide range of coping styles, including being hyper-vigilant, or "acting out". Commenting on this reality, lifelong advocate, researcher, and author Susan Schechter observed, "[w]ithin shelters, conflicts between women can come out through their children. Some children intimidate their peers and others arrive enraged. Racist comments become a way for children to cope with terrors about their new environment" ( Schechter, 1982, p. 90 ). In response, some shelters develop special programming that focuses on the adjustment of children to shelter, and processing their fears and concerns seems to alleviate some of the issues. It takes time for both the mother and children to adjust to being away from the abuser and the environment created by the climate of violence in the home.
Shelter Rules and Structure
As we analyze conflict resolution, it is important to acknowledge that many advocates are working within an established system, structure, and agency culture that they did not participate in creating and may have limited power to change. Shelter advocates themselves may feel that the lines between structures and rules designed originally to be protective and those that are unnecessarily restrictive have become blurred. Fortunately, an increasing number of domestic violence programs have initiated internal critiques of their shelter rules and structures, examining the extent to which they compromise rather than support the empowerment of residents and designing alternative approaches.
At the same time, it should be no surprise that some victims embrace structures that others experience as overly strict and even punitive. Shelter "rules" might actually represent a very familiar standard to some women, one that they lived daily during an abusive childhood or with their adult abuser, and one that they know how to negotiate. For others, however, an overly structured shelter environment resonates in ways that produce anger, resistance, and even defiance. If residents have no outlet to express these feelings, or are afraid to raise concerns with staff who have the power to ask them to leave, they may take their anger out on other shelter residents. In many instances, then, a punitive or restrictive shelter environment may reinforce the power and control dynamics that advocates are trying to help women escape.
As the earlier chart described, shelter residents participating in the Shelter Study raised particular areas of concern about a number of aspects of shelter life, most of which could result in conflict with staff or other residents, and which were resolved less frequently: "Problems with shelter rules included issues with time limits (16%), curfew (14%), child discipline and monitoring (13%), and chores (13%)." The Shelter Study report continued:
Residents felt time limits were too short, inflexible, or not explained clearly with appropriate notice. Many noted the time limits didn't take into consideration that finding other living arrangements was difficult. As one wrote, "Not my fault apartments were full or I couldn't afford them." Another observed that "they need to realize that some people have nowhere to go at all." Some felt the time limits forced them to go back to the abuser: "I was here for 90 days then ended up back in my abusive relationship because I had nowhere to go." One also noted she felt 'overwhelmed and anxiety worrying about it." Fifty percent of these problems were resolved.
Curfew issues included conflicts with work and church. One noted that it "was embarrassing to leave church [because of curfew]." Another stated, "Evening service, church functions, visits with daughter all 'no.'" Some felt the curfew was too early: "We are grown women, 8:00 is ridiculous;" or that there was unequal enforcement: "They said no curfew but one woman and kids were kicked out when [they] came home at 9:05 pm." Others believed that curfew should be flexible. "Unbending, mothers and children should be able to spend time together on Christmas." Some thought curfew should be extended on weekends. Still others noted that it was annoying but understandable for safety. Sixty-one percent of these problems were resolved ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 86 ).
As reported in the Shelter Study, other disagreements related to thefts, use of drugs, and the different degrees to which residents followed the rules. One respondent commented, "Some think rules don't apply to them." Another wrote, "Some problems were uncalled for and were only occurring because there was not strong rule following for this person (as far as respecting other people in the shelter) she did not respect me at all " ( Lyon et al., 2008, p. 84 ).
When in crisis mode, many victims may do things they would not typically do to meet the needs of their family. A punitive environment within the shelter has the ability to exacerbate a sense of desperation among residents related to availability and use of resources, as well as competing or conflicting needs for advocacy. If bus passes, food, baby care items, personal hygiene items, and financial assistance are difficult to obtain because of house rules and agency restrictions - real or perceived - theft and related conflict may occur between residents.
Shelter staff can provide guidelines for resolving conflicts that arise in these areas of interpersonal relationships, but should also let residents work within their own problem solving skills and ability to negotiate between themselves to address most problems. All victims have had to utilize a variety of skills in compromise and negotiation to manage previous living situations. Past resourcefulness and creativity in resolving conflicts and diffusing potentially volatile situations can be put to good use within the shelter environment.
Supporting conflict resolution between shelter residents is an important part of domestic violence intervention work. Helping women better identify the roots of conflict with other shelter residents and reinforcing how to resolve conflict in respectful and productive ways can go a long way to building a truly supportive, nurturing and empowering shelter environment. When conflicts arise between advocates and shelter residents, shelter staff must ensure that their response does not reinforce the power and control dynamics that are at the core of domestic violence. Advocates who work to end domestic violence come to their positions with their own personal/familial experiences, values, and perceptions, which all impact their approach to shelter work and their comfort in naming and addressing the challenges that arises.
While problems and conflicts might be inevitable within domestic violence shelters, whether staff and volunteers have the skills and tools necessary to resolve them should not be left to chance. The scenarios and resources that follow provide a framework for enhancing staff skills in this area and better meet the needs of survivors who turn to us for assistance.
The following scenarios are intended to demonstrate types of conflict that may arise in the shelter setting. Each scenario is followed by questions to be considered and used for discussion as part of discussions about approaches to more effective conflict resolution.
Scenario 1
Judy arrived at the shelter late last night and needs court accompaniment for a Protective Order hearing this morning. Her case is quite severe and involves use of strangulation, weapons, and threats to kill her by her partner who is a law enforcement officer. Prior to Judy's arrival, another resident, Donna, requested transportation and accompaniment to her appointment for transitional housing; she's new to the area and very nervous about her interview. At this time, there's only one staff member (the Case Manager) who's available to go to one of the appointments.
Questions to be explored....
Which appointment should the Case Manager attend? Why?
What other resources/options might be offered to the resident who will not be accompanied by the Case Manager?
How will that message be delivered to each resident in need of and requesting service?
What are the implications for staff relationships with residents in these situations?
Are there conflicting concerns or priorities regarding service provision amongst the staff (case management vs. legal)? What implications do they have in this scenario?
What role might agency policies, program or funding goals, and advocacy philosophy play in this situation?
Scenario 2
Suki has been in the shelter for 3 months now, awaiting final confirmation of her move-in date for transitional housing (it's been rescheduled twice at this point). She's becoming increasingly frustrated with the slow response from the Housing Authority, and with the rules of the shelter, which she finds to be very limiting and too strict for a grown woman in her 40's.
On a few occasions she's been written up for not having her daughter in school during the weekday. Suki was very upset that shelter staff did not respect her decision to keep her child home from school because her hair wasn't done and her uniform had not been washed. On another occasion, it was snowing outside and her daughter did not have a proper winter coat, so she didn't feel that her daughter could walk to school. This morning, Suki's frustrations boiled over and she screamed at the Director of the Shelter, and made physically threatening gestures. Several residents saw this happen and now Suki has stormed out of the shelter.
Questions to be explored....
How do you respond to the residents who have witnessed this entire exchange?
What will be the staff response to Suki when she returns to the shelter?
What are the implications for your continued service provision to Suki and her daughter?
How might Suki's past experiences with domestic violence and at the shelter, including past conflicts with staff, contribute to this situation?
What role might shelter rules, program or funding goals, and advocacy philosophy play in this situation?
Scenario 3
Recently, Kelly, the overnight weekend staff at the shelter, was out sick for a few days. Staff who filled in for her reported that a few women came in past curfew and two of them appeared inebriated. They made lots of noise and disturbed several of the children who had already been put to bed. When confronted by the relief staff, the residents said that Kelly lets them come in when they want to because it's the weekend and she believes they need more freedom in the shelter. To date, as Director, you've received no reports that residents in the shelter have come in past curfew or been suspected of drinking alcohol, however you are aware that one of the women that came in late has a history of substance abuse.
Questions to be explored....
As Kelly's supervisor, how to do manage this situation upon her return?
How do you respond to the residents that have been "breaking shelter rules" with the permission of shelter staff?
Noting the past experiences of each of the women that came in past curfew, including victimization, shelter living, and various interactions with staff, how might those experiences have contributed to this situation?
What role might agency policy, shelter rules, and advocacy philosophy play in this situation?
What are the implications for staff relationships with residents in the shelter? Consider those that were involved and those that were not.
How do you raise and discuss these issues at your next staff meeting? Consider whether there are factors that make exceptions to rules necessary. Who should be making that judgment and on what basis?
This section organizes information and resources related to effectively managing interpersonal conflict, including the types that arise within a shelter setting. Reference materials list training manuals, additional resources, and tools that can be helpful to shelter staff and survivors.
