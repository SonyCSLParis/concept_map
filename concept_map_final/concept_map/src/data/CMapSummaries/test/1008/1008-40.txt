The following is an overview of education services offered by the Susan B. Anthony Project. For each topic listed, we will conduct a variety of activities with your students. All lessons can be modified to best suit the needs of your students and their teachers. We are happy to work with classroom teachers and school administrators to adjust our current programs or to develop new ones to provide the most positive experience possible.
Safe Touch Puppet Show: Pre-school through 3rd grade
The Safe Touch curriculum teaches young children to know and recognize their body parts, identify feelings, and clarify the difference between good touch, bad touch and uh-oh touches. Children learn to identify the "uh-oh", or uncomfortable feeling, and what to do if someone touches them in a way that makes feel uncomfortable. The difference between good secrets and bad secrets is also discussed, and children are taught that they need to tell an adult if keeping a secret makes them uncomfortable or is unsafe. The curriculum also encourages children to trust their instincts, and establishes that children have the right to say no and the right to ask for help. These skills help children develop a clear sense of their body rights and a voice to speak out against people who may be violating this right.
Bullyproof: 3rd through 6th grade
The Bullyproof curriculum has been developed to address the pervasive problem of bullying and teasing that occurs in the lives of many elementary school children. The program enables students to distinguish between joking, teasing, and bullying, and to identify various options available to a child who is being bullied. Bullyproof also helps children to recognize the responsibility of bystanders to the bullying. This program can be held for one class session, over several days in one week, once a month throughout the year, or several times during the school year. Depending on time available and age of the participants, the curriculum can also be used as a context for discussing sexual harassment.
