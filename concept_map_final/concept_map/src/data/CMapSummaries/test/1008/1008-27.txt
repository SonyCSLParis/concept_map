Child Development, March/April 2008, Volume 79, Number 2, Pages 426 - 443 The Quality and Frequency of Mother - Toddler Conflict: Links With Attachment and Temperament Deborah Laible and Tia Panfile Lehigh University Drika Makariev University of California-Davis The goal of this study was to examine the links among attachment, child temperament, and the quality and frequency of mother - toddler conflict. Sixty-four mothers and children took part in a series of laboratory tasks when the child was 30 months of age and an audiorecorded home observation when the child was 36 months of age. All episodes of conflict were identified from the videotapes/audiotapes, transcribed, and coded for conflict strategies, resolution, and themes. Mothers also completed measures of attachment security and child temperament. Concurrent attachment security was related to the quality of mother - toddler conflict (including resolution, justification, and compromise) at both periods but not to the frequency of conflict. In addition, aspects of child temperament (i.e., negative reactivity and activity level/impulsivity) were related to both the quality and the frequency of mother - toddler conflict. Conflict between young children and their parents is both normative and frequent during the toddler and early preschool years (Klimes-Dougan & Kopp, 1999; Kuczynski, Kochanska, Radke-Yarrow, & GirniusBrown, 1987; Laible & Thompson, 2002). In a review of the literature on parenting and emotion, Dix (1991) suggested that parents with young children are engaged in conflict with them on average between 3.5 and 15 times an hour, although others (KlimesDougan & Kopp, 1999; Laible & Thompson, 2002) have reported even higher rates of conflict. It is hardly surprising that parent - child conflict peaks in the toddler years; at the very time children become capable of asserting their own will, their parents begin to assert control over their children's behavior to ensure that children comply with social and moral norms. However, it is important to note that not all conflict between parents and their young children surrounds issues of socialization (Dunn, 1988; Eisenberg, 1992). In fact, to view conflict solely in terms of socialization attempts or child noncompliance would be to neglect the diversity of daily conflict in the lives of parents and children of this age. In addition to child noncompliance, disagreements between young children and their mothers frequently surround issues of fact, caretaking, and parental noncompliance with child requests (Eisenberg, 1992). Support for this research was provided by a NICHD Grant 1R03 MH65381-01 to D.L.

In addition, there is a growing recognition that these early conflicts may serve important developmental functions (Dunn & Slomkowski, 1992; KlimesDougan & Kopp, 1999; Laible & Thompson, 2002). Thus, children may learn important lessons out of these early conflicts with parents. Conflicts between young children and their parents frequently involve the discussion of emotions, rules, needs, and consequences of actions, all of which likely promote the child's understanding of emotions and morality (Laible & Thompson, 2002). Furthermore, there are good reasons to believe that children are learning how to argue and how to manage conflict from these early conflicts with parents. Research has shown that in the context of these early arguments with mothers, children are learning how to negotiate and to justify their side of arguments and that these skills are eventually transferred to arguments with peers (Herrera & Dunn, 1997). As children develop, their ability to negotiate in the context of conflict improves (KlimesDougan & Kopp, 1999) not only because children's perspective taking and other related cognitive skills improve but also because they begin to understand that conflict resolution requires some degree of persuasion and compromise. Researchers, however, have argued that for conflict to be developmentally enhancing, it must be of high quality (Laible & Thompson, 2002). Conflict that is constructive and that involves high levels of mitigation, justification, and resolution is more likely to # 2008, Copyright the Author(s) Journal Compilation # 2008, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc. All rights reserved. 0009-3920/2008/7902-0012 Mother - Toddler Conflict 427 foster understanding than conflict that involves little discussion, negotiation, and resolution. Several preliminary studies support this idea. For example, Laible and Thompson (2002) found links between the quality of mother - toddler conflict and the children's subsequent emotional and moral understanding. In this study, maternal justification, mitigation, resolution, and discussion of emotion during conflict episodes at 30 months were associated with children's subsequent emotional understanding, behavioral internalization, and prosocial representations of relationships at age 3. Similarly, Herrera and Dunn (1997) found that mothers' use of other-oriented reasoning during conflict with toddlers predicted children's subsequent social competence in conflicts with peers at age 6. Researchers have found that there are tremendous dyadic differences in the quality and frequency of conflict across mother - toddler dyads (see, e.g., Dunn & Munn, 1985; Eisenberg, 1992; Laible & Thompson, 2002). What is not clear in the current research is what factors contribute to differences in the quality and frequency of conflict in mother - child dyads during the toddler and preschool years. This study examines three potential factors that are likely important in shaping both the frequency and the quality of mother - toddler conflict: attachment, temperament, and gender. Attachment Although the common perception is that secure attachment relationships involve less overall conflict, the evidence that conflict is less prevalent in secure attachment relationships and more prevalent in insecure attachment relationships is weak at best and at this point not sufficiently empirically examined. Although researchers have found that a secure attachment predicts more shared positive affect (Matas, Arend, & Sroufe, 1978), compliance with maternal suggestions (Londerville & Main, 1981; Sroufe, 1983) and affective sharing (Waters, Wippman, & Sroufe, 1979) during free play, cleanup tasks, and other shared activities, whether this also means secure dyads experience less conflict on a day-to-day basis remains an empirical question to be answered. As a result, it may be just as plausible, relying on attachment theory, to suggest that securely attached dyads may experience more conflict than insecurely attached dyads. A securely attached child, for example, having confidence in her caregiver's responsiveness and willingness to negotiate, may feel more capable of challenging an attachment figure under certain circumstances than an insecurely attached child. In fact, this is exactly what Matas et al. (1978) found in an early study. In this study, although securely attached children were more compliant in a teaching task than insecure children, secure children were actually less compliant during a cleanup task when less was at stake. The difference in conflict between secure and insecure attachment relationships may not necessarily lie in the frequency of the conflict, however, but rather in the quality of the conflict between mothers and toddlers. Because securely attached children expect their partner to communicate openly and because of their own ability and that of the caregiver to discuss emotional issues (Bretherton, 1990), conflict between securely attached children and their parents is likely to be constructive in nature (involving mutual discussion, negotiation, and the open discussion of emotion). In contrast, because of the lack of ability of both the mother and the child in an insecure dyad to communicate effectively with each other, especially in circumstances involving negative emotions, conflict between a parent and a child is likely to be less constructive (involving little reasoning, discussion, and negotiation, and perhaps greater defiance and coercion). Although research examining the link between attachment security and the quality of communication in conflict is lacking, researchers have found that the quality of communication in secure dyads (compared with insecure dyads) is of higher quality in other contexts, such as when reminiscing about the child's past emotional experiences (Laible, 2004a, 2004b, 2006). Child Temperament In addition to attachment, there are good reasons to expect that a child's temperament may influence the quality and frequency of mother - toddler conflict. The relation between a child's temperament and a parent - child conflict is likely to be complex because not only does a child's temperament evoke certain responses from others (Plomin, 1986; Rothbart & Bates, 1998; Scarr & McCartney, 1983) but it also influences the child's own cognitive and emotional functioning (e.g., Goldsmith & Gottesman, 1981; Wachs & Gandour, 1984). Children with difficult temperaments (e.g., those high in negative emotionality) may evoke more conflict from caregivers, not only because they become upset easily and are hard to soothe, but also because they drain the energy and patience of caregivers (Goldsmith et al., 1987). At the same time, children who are high in negative emotionality, for example, may also have more trouble being constructive in conflict because the cognitive resources that they need to justify or negotiate their side of the argument may be drained by the energy it takes to regulate their negative affect. 428 Laible, Panfile, and Makariev The limited research available examining the relation between conflict frequency and temperament suggests that a child's temperament does affect the amount of conflict. For example, children who have scored high on negative emotionality/reactivity dimensions of temperament have been shown to experience greater rates of parent - child conflict and to be more likely to suffer from subsequent behavior problems (Bates & Bayles, 1984; Chess & Thomas, 1977; Rubin, Burgess, Dwyer, & Hastings, 2003). Research examining how the quality of the conflict might differ as a result of the child's temperament is lacking. Researchers have found evidence, however, that temperament does shape the quality of communication between mothers and young children in other relational contexts (Laible, 2004b; Lewis, 1999), and thus, there are good reasons to believe that temperament will also relate to the quality of communication in the context of mother - toddler conflict. Gender Relatively little research on parent - child conflict has examined the role of gender in influencing the nature of the dyadic conflict. Researchers examining peer conflict have found differences between boys and girls in the strategies that they use in conflict with peers. For example, Dunn and Herrera (1997) found that girls were more likely than boys to submit in conflict with peers and were more likely to use conflict strategies that entailed submission, distraction, and clarification. Similarly, Miller, Danaher, and Forbes (1986) found that girls were more likely than boys to use mitigation in conflicts with peers. Together, these findings do suggest that girls, in line with their traditional gender roles, may use strategies in conflict that are consistent with maintaining relational harmony (see Maccoby, 1990). Because of these findings with peer conflict, there are good reasons to believe that children may adopt different strategies in conflict with mothers as well based on their gender. It is less clear, however, from the previous research whether mothers will also adopt different strategies in conflict based on the gender of their child. However, given that mothers may also socialize gender roles in the context of conflict, there are also good reasons to believe that mothers may use different strategies in conflict based on the gender of their child. Conclusions and the Current Study The goal of the current study was to examine how child temperament, attachment security, and gender related to the quality and frequency of mother - toddler conflict at both 30 and 36 months. Others have examined the developmental changes in mother - toddler conflict (see Dunn & Munn, 1985; Klimes-Dougan & Kopp, 1999), and thus, this was not our goal. Based on the research discussed earlier, we expected attachment security to predict the quality but not the frequency of mother - child conflict at both time periods. As a result, we expected both partners of a securely attached dyad to engage in higher levels of justification and mitigation and lower levels of conflict aggravation than insecure dyads. In addition, we expected secure dyads to resolve conflicts more frequently than insecure dyads, even though the proportion of resolved conflicts between mothers and toddlers in general is low (see Laible & Thompson, 2002). We also expected aspects of children's temperament to relate to both the quality and the frequency of conflict. Children with more difficult temperaments (especially those high in negative emotionality and activity level/impulsivity) should have more frequent and less constructive conflicts (involving less mitigation, compromise, and resolution) with their mothers than those children with less difficult temperamental profiles. Finally, it also seems likely based on the limited research that has been done on gender and conflict that girls may be more likely to mitigate and submit in conflict with mothers than are boys. Method Participants Sixty-four mother - child dyads were recruited to participate in the study. Mothers were recruited when the target child was between 26 and 29 months of age using names drawn from local birth announcements. Although 64 mother - toddler dyads (31 girls and 33 boys) completed the 30-month assessments, 4 mother - child dyads dropped out of the study before the 36-month assessment (due to pregnancy and work schedules). The remaining 60 participants included 30 girls and 30 boys and were primarily Caucasian (78%). The remaining participants were African American (5%), Latino American (9%), and mixed ethnicity (5%). Mother's average age at the 36-month assessments was 36.5 years (SD 5 5.0 years, range 5 22 - 48 years) and 70.9% of the mothers had a college or advanced degree. All participants came from a large Southern city and were recruited through birth records printed in local newspapers. Recruitment letters were sent home to participants in the area and interested participants called the researcher. Mother - Toddler Conflict 429 Overview of Procedures At both 30 and 36 months of age, mothers completed measures of attachment (the Attachment Q-Set [AQS]) and temperament (the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire [TBAQ] Supplemental). At 30 months of age, mothers and children took part in a laboratory session containing a series of standardized tasks designed to provide a forum for conflict. At 36 months, mothers and children took part in a 90-min audiorecorded home visit that surrounded the dinner hour. The 30-month assessments allowed for us to examine the links between attachment, temperament, and conflict under more controlled, standardized conditions, whereas the home visit at 36 months allowed us to examine the links under more naturalistic conditions. To ensure retention in the study, mothers were offered small monetary payments for their participation in lab assessments and slightly larger payments for their participation in the follow-up home visits. Children were given a small toy for their participation in the lab and home visits. Measures Attachment (30 and 36 Months) At their homes under the guidance of trained assistant, mothers completed the AQS (Waters & Deane, 1985). The AQS has emerged as a psychometrically sound procedure to measure secure base behavior in preschool children (Teti & McGourty, 1996). Although some disagreement exists on whether trained observers or mothers should complete the sort, research by Teti and McGourty (1996) does suggest that mothers can provide valid sorts, provided mothers are properly trained, kept blind to the construct being measured, and supervised during their sort in case questions arise. Such procedures have yielded predictive validity consistent with attachment theory in recent studies (see, e.g., Laible, 2004b; Laible & Thompson, 1998), and thus, we used these procedures to ensure valid sorts from mothers. Temperament (30 and 36 Months) Mothers completed a supplemented version of the TBAQ (Goldsmith, 1996; see Rothbart, Ellis, Reuda, & Posner, 2003 for information on the supplements) at both time periods. The supplemented version included the original TBAQ scales (Activity Level, Anger/Frustration, Positive Anticipation, Low Intensity Pleasure, and Fear) and were supplemented by eight additional scales (Attentional Shifting, Discom- fort, High Intensity Pleasure, Inhibitory Control, Perceptual Sensitivity, Sadness, Soothability, and Impulsivity; see Rothbart et al., 2003). All 13 scales were rated on a 7-point scale. Based on previous factor analytic work (Putnam, Gartstein, & Rothbart, 2006; Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher, 2001), two scales were formed: effortful control (consisting of Attentional Shifting, Inhibitory Control, Low Intensity Pleasure, and Perceptual Sensitivity) and negative reactivity (consisting of Anger/Frustration, Sadness, Discomfort, Fear, and the reversed scales of Positive Anticipation and Soothability). A third scale was also formed that consisted of activity level and impulsivity because these were moderately correlated (r 5 .48 at 30 months and r 5 .46 at 36 months, p , .01). All the new scales had adequate internal consistency (as 5 .85 and .82 for 30- and 36-month negative reactivity, as 5 .75 and .91 for 30- and 36-month effortful control, as 5 .70 and .70 for 30- and 36-month activity level/impulsivity scale). Conflict Assessments in the Lab At 30 months, each mother - child dyad took part in a series of structured tasks (described below) that were designed to provide a context for conflict under standardized conditions. Laboratory sessions lasted approximately 51 min (M 5 51.07, SD 5 5.90), and conflict was monitored throughout the four segments (free play and cleanup, storybook reading, reminiscing conversations, and frustration task). Throughout the entire laboratory paradigm, mothers and their children were in a laboratory playroom that included a low-shelf-containing toys considered attractive to children of this age (e.g., a Tickle Me Elmo, a colorful train set). Mothers were asked at the start of the laboratory paradigm to prohibit their children from touching and playing with toys on the attractive toy shelf. Mothers were instructed to correct their child's behavior toward the forbidden toy shelf in any way they felt comfortable, but to behave as they would at home when trying to prevent their child from touching something forbidden. Free play and cleanup. Each mother - child dyad began the laboratory session with a 12-min period of free play with attractive toys scattered about the playroom. At the end of the 12 min, the experimenter returned briefly to ask the mother to instruct the child to place all the toys away in a number of baskets, containers, or bags. Mothers were given 15 min to accomplish this task; however, if the mother and child finished before the researcher returned, they were asked to retrieve the experimenter from an adjoining room. 430 Laible, Panfile, and Makariev The free play was designed primarily to allow the child and parent to become comfortable in the lab but was also monitored for conflict, because mothers and children sometimes engaged in friendly opposition over issues of pretend play and assertions. In contrast, the cleanup task was designed to enhance the possibility of conflict in the dyad, especially over issues of the child's noncompliance (Kochanska, 1995). Storybook reading. Following the cleanup, mothers were asked to elicit the child's help in making up a story on the basis of pictures in a wordless storybook. This task provided an opportunity for dyads to argue over assertions and the child's lack of cooperation during a challenging task for 30-month-olds. Reminiscing conversations. Following a procedure similar to that used by Laible and Song (2006), mothers were asked to discuss with their toddler two incidents that occurred approximately within the past week. Each mother was asked to think about two incidents involving both herself and her child- one in which her child experienced a positive emotion and one in which the child experienced a negative emotion. Once the events were selected, the mother was asked to sit comfortably with her child and to attempt to elicit the child's memory about the event in as natural of a way as possible. The length of the interview was determined by the mother who notified the researcher when the conversation ended. These conversations about a child's past emotional experiences were included because they typically yield frequent conflict between mothers and their children, usually over intentions and assertions (Laible & Song, 2006). Frustration paradigm. For the last 15 min of the laboratory session, mothers were asked to complete the TBAQ while seated in a chair in the laboratory playroom. Although the child waited for his or her mother to complete the questionnaire, each child was given a puzzle that was too difficult to complete. The age inappropriate puzzle was intended to enhance the desirability of the forbidden shelf to the child and increase the likelihood of conflict in the dyad. Conflict Assessments in the Home At 36 months, each mother - child dyad also took part in an approximately 90-min audiorecorded naturalistic home observation. The observation took place at a time of reported frequent mother - child conflict: prior to and during dinner (Grieshaber, 1997). A tape recorder was dropped off with the mother 1 hr before dinner. Mothers were instructed on the use of the recorder and asked to begin recording 30 min before dinner. Mothers were asked to stay in the presence of the target child as much as possible during the audio recording and to keep the recorder nearby. To ensure that the audio recording was clear, mothers were asked to remain indoors with the target child during the taping and to limit their movements during the audio recording. The mother was informed that the experimenter wished to study typical family interaction and to carry out her usual routines during the observations. Fathers and siblings were present in about one half of the recordings (48.3% had a father present, 48.3% had one or more siblings present, and 29.7% had siblings and a father present). A small number of mothers stopped the recording early, often because the child fell asleep or went to bed. Conflict identification and frequency coding. From the videotapes of lab conflicts and the audiotapes of home conflicts, all episodes of conflict were identified and coded. Conflict episodes were defined unilaterally as the first oppositional verbal turn (following Eisenberg, 1992; Hay, 1984; Laible & Thompson, 2002). Thus, coding teams examined the videotapes and audiotapes for all verbal oppositional statements by either the mother or the child, including objections, refusals, verbal denials, conflicting claims, disagreements, and contradictions in response to the other. Following Eisenberg (1992) conflict episodes included the initial opposition and all following conversational turns until either the topic of the conversation was switched, one party submitted, a consensus was reached, or the silence lasted longer than 30 s. Conversational turns included all statements made by one speaker prior to the other's response. Due to the fact that all of the videotaped 30-month sessions and several of the audiotapes differed in length, the total number of conflict episodes in both the videotapes from the lab and the audiotapes from the home were corrected for by the length of each recording. Thus, in each case, we calculated the number of conflict episodes per hour and this served as our unit of analysis for conflict frequency. For 10 videotapes and 10 audiotapes, conflict episodes were identified by two independent coders to assess the reliability of the identification of conflict episodes. Coders agreed on the presence of a particular conflict episode 85.62% of the time and on the number of conversational turns per conflict episode 88.08% of the time in the transcripts made from the videotapes of lab conflicts. Similarly, coders agreed 84.71% of the time on the presence of a particular conflict episode and 86.23% on the number of conversational turns per conflict episode in the transcripts made from the audiotaped home visit. Mother - Toddler Conflict 431 Conflict strategies. Each conversational turn was coded as involving one of the following strategies (from Herrera & Dunn, 1997): 1. Mitigation consisted of compromise and bargaining (e.g., ''I will let you have a piece of candy if you eat your dinner''). 2. Justification consisted of uses of clarification, reasoning, and requests for clarification (e.g., ''you need to eat your dinner, so that you will not be hungry later''). 3. Aggravation consisted of the use of threats, teasing, or simple insistence without clarification (e.g., ''because I told you so''). 4. Other consisted of distraction, acts of submission, off-topic, and neutral statements. Following Herrera and Dunn (1997), conversational turns involving more than one strategy were coded as the strategy reflecting the highest socialcognitive level (see above). This hierarchy was developed based on the work of Eisenberg and Garvey (1981). These and other researchers (e.g., Laursen & Hartup, 1989; Selman, 1980) have suggested that compromise and reasoning involve more adaptive and advanced functioning compared with simple insistence without explanation. Furthermore, the use of mitigation and reasoning in conflict has been shown to increase across age (see Klimes-Dougan & Kopp, 1999), and thus, is assumed to reflect improvements in children's underlying social-cognitive skills (Herrera & Dunn, 1997). Final scores were calculated for each strategy based on the proportion of total number of conflict conversational turns containing each strategy for each partner (i.e., the mother and the child). Child mitigations were extremely rare at both time periods (Ms , 0.006), and thus, these were excluded from further analyses (including reliability analyses). Ten videotapes and 10 audiotapes were coded by two independent coders to establish reliability. Cohen's kappa for maternal conflict strategies was .72 in the lab and .79 in the home conflict. Cohen's kappa for child conflict strategies was .75 in the lab and .76 in the home conflict. Resolution. Finally, following procedures developed by Herrera and Dunn (1997), each conflict episode was scored for resolution and for the person credited with resolving the conflict. Each conflict episode was scored as being either a successful resolution or unresolved. Conflicts were scored as resolved when a party either submitted (e.g., ''yes you are right'') or a compromise was offered by one party and the second party agreed to it. In all conflict episodes that were scored as resolved, the person responsible for the resolution was noted (i.e., the mother or the child). The person responsible for the resolution was defined as the one whose conversational turn was the final resolution, or in cases of compromise or submission, the person who suggested the compromise or who submitted to the desires of the other (Herrera & Dunn, 1997). Each resolution category score was expressed as the proportion of total conflict episodes containing a particular resolution (i.e., mother submitted, child submitted, mother compromised, child compromised, unresolved). The number of conflicts that were ended by compromises from either party were rare (Ms , 0.017). Because the pattern of relations was similar across the types of resolution, only proportions of resolved conflicts are used in subsequent analyses. Cohen's kappa for the coding of resolved versus unresolved conflicts was .87 for the lab conflicts and .74 for the home conflicts. Cohen's kappa for the party responsible for the resolution was .91 in the lab conflicts and .85 in the home conflicts. Conflict themes. Each conflict episode received a code reflecting the topic of the dispute (adapted from Dunn & Munn, 1985): 1. Manners/politeness (M 5 0.07, SD 5 0.03 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.03, SD 5 0.05 in home conflicts) included conflicts focused on the child's attempts or failures to behave politely. 2. Caretaking (M 5 0.02, SD 5 0.04 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.27, SD 5 0.16 in home conflicts) included conflicts focused on the child's behavior during caretaking routines, including eating, toilet training, bath time, and so forth. 3. Destruction (M 5 0.09, SD 5 0.09 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.14, SD 5 0.13 in home conflicts) included conflicts surrounding the child's unruly behavior such as noisiness, making a mess, throwing things, and so forth. 4. Possessions/rights/turns (M 5 0.14, SD 5 0.10 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.18, SD 5 0.11 in home conflicts) included conflicts surrounding objects, sharing, or turn taking. 5. Rules of the house/lab (M 5 0.23, SD 5 0.17 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.01, SD 5 0.02 in home conflicts) included conflicts centered on objects that were forbidden or out of place and correct routines (e.g., not eating candy for dinner). 6. Hurting/aggression/unkindness (M 5 0.04, SD 5 0.14 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.02, SD 5 0.04 in home conflicts) included conflicts that centered on a child's aggressive behavior and behavior that might harm others. 432 Laible, Panfile, and Makariev 7. Physical space (M 5 0.13, SD 5 0.11 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.08, SD 5 0.07 in home conflicts) included conflicts focused on the invasion of another's personal space, being in the way of someone, or forbidden spaces. 8. Independence (M 5 0.09, SD 5 0.10 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.06, SD 5 0.05 in home conflicts) involved conflicts that centered on a child's demand for independence or aid. 9. Facts (M 5 0.25, SD 5 0.19 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.19, SD 5 0.11 in home conflicts) involved conflicts that centered on facts, states of reality, and propositions. 10. Other actions (M 5 0.03, SD 5 0.04 in lab conflicts; M 5 0.02, SD 5 0.03 in home conflicts) included conflicts that did not fit the above categories. In cases where the topic of the conflict changed over the course of the episode, multiple themes were coded. The total number of conflict themes was summed for each category and divided by the total number of conflict episodes to obtain the proportion of total conflict episodes containing a particular theme for each mother - child pair. Cohen's kappa on the conflict theme coding (based on 10 transcripts) was .81 in lab conflicts and .82 in home conflicts. These codes were factor analyzed (principal components with varimax rotation) to reduce the number of codes. Because the pattern of conflict themes varied across each of the contexts (e.g., there were more conflicts over rules in the lab), the factor analysis was slightly different across the two contexts. For conflict in the lab, three factors emerged. The first factor (k 5 1.89, 27.09% of the variance) was labeled ''conflicts over destruction/aggression'' and consisted of both aggression (.60) and destruction (.66) loading positively. The second factor (k 5 1.47, 21.01% of the variance) was labeled ''conflicts over physical space'' and consisted of physical space (.77), which loaded positively and rules, which loaded negatively (À.84). The third factor (k 5 1.23, 17.62% of the variance) was labeled ''conflicts over possessions and independence'' and consisted of both of these variables that loaded positively (.77 and .68, respectively). In the home conflicts, a factor analysis of the conflict themes also revealed a three-factor solution. The first factor that emerged was labeled ''conflicts over destruction/aggression'' (k 5 1.87, 20.87% of the variance) and consisted of aggression (.73) and destruction (.90) that loaded positively. The second factor that emerged (k 5 1.55, 17.25% of the variance) was labeled ''conflicts over possessions and facts'' consisted of facts (.60) and possessions (.64), which loaded positively and caretaking (À.87), which loaded negatively. The third factor (k 5 1.30, 14.52% of the variance) was labeled ''conflicts over space and independence'' and consisted of space (.59) and independence (.81) that loaded positively. Results Descriptive and Bivariate Information Descriptive information on the conflict variables appears in Table 1. Table 2 reflects the correlations among the predictors of conflict across the contexts. Both attachment and temperament were relatively stable across the two assessment periods. Table 3 reflects the correlations between the conflict strategies across the two assessment periods. Because conflict themes differed across the two assessments, these were omitted from the table. It is important to point out, however, that conflicts surrounding aggression/ destruction (the one parallel factor that emerged across the two contexts) were highly correlated (r 5 .53, p , .01). The other factors from the conflict themes were unrelated across contexts. The other elements of conflict were relatively consistent across context/ time. The two exceptions, however, were conflict frequency and maternal mitigation, which were not correlated across context. There were other interesting relations among conflict elements that can be seen in Table 3. For example, conflict resolution at both time periods was related to both mother and child's use of constructive conflict strategies (e.g., justification, lack of aggravation, and mitigation). In addition, mothers and children were often using similar Table 1 Descriptive Information on Conflict Predictors and Elements M (SD) at 30 months in the lab 0.42 (0.17) 4.61 (0.50) 3.33 (0.41) 4.63 (0.94) 25.53 (10.74) 0.34 (0.19) 0.72 (0.15) 0.21 (0.17) 0.03 (0.04) 0.34 (0.18) 0.54 (0.23) M (SD) at 36 months in the home 0.38 (0.19) 4.68 (0.54) 3.29 (0.42) 4.40 (0.98) 20.73 (10.05) 0.25 (0.12) 0.65 (0.12) 0.26 (0.13) 0.03 (0.03) 0.45 (0.17) 0.43 (0.19) Variable Attachment Effortful control Negative reactivity Activity level/impulsivity Conflict frequency Conflict resolution Maternal justification Maternal aggravation Maternal compromise Child justification Child aggravation Table 2 Correlations Between Conflict Predictors 1 - .12 - À.10 .17 - .04 À.24 À.37** À.33* - .12 À.21 À.12 À.06 .22 - .15 .14 .56** À.23 À.23 À.21 - .21 .02 À.13 À.33* .71** .04 À.07 À.26* - À.13 .07 .42** - À.16 .15 .33* .83** À.20 À.08 .18 - 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .10 À.29* À.09 À.08 .17 .92** À.23 À.18 .03 - Variable 1.

Bivariate relations between the conflict predictors and the conflict elements appear in Tables 4 and 5. Attachment security at 30 months was related to most of the indices of conflict quality (but not conflict frequency) in the lab. Securely attached mothers and children resolved conflicts, more frequently, were more likely to justify their side of an argument and were less likely to aggravate conflict in the lab. In addition, secure dyads argued more frequently about possessions and independence. There was also a trend for securely attached dyads in the lab to argue less frequently over the child's destructive and aggressive behavior and more likely to argue over physical space than insecure dyads. Aspects of child temperament at 30 months were also related to the quality and frequency of mother - toddler conflict. Children who were high in negative reactivity at 30 months had mothers who were more likely to aggravate in conflict and less likely to justify their side of an argument when compared to mothers of children who were low in negative reactivity. Similarly, children who were high in negative reactivity at 30 months were less likely to justify their side of an argument and more likely to aggravate it. Negative reactivity was also associated with less frequent conflict resolution in the lab. Children who were highly active at 30 months had more frequent and unresolved conflict with their mothers in the lab and more conflicts over the child's destructive and aggressive behavior. These highly active children also had mothers who were less likely to justify their side of an argument and more likely to aggravate in conflict in the lab when compared to mothers of children who were less active. Active children at 30 months also had more frequent unresolved conflicts in the home and more conflicts over the child's destructive and aggressive behavior. Children high in effortful control had mothers who were more likely to compromise in conflict in the lab. In the home, concurrent attachment security was related to multiple aspects of conflict quality. Secure dyads resolved conflict more frequently and argued less than insecure dyads about the child's destructive and aggressive behavior in the home. Both partners in a secure dyad were also more likely to justify their side of an argument and less likely to aggravate it in the home than insecure dyads. Finally, mothers were more likely to compromise in conflict in the home with secure children than insecure children. At 36 months, temperament was again related to conflict frequency and quality (but less so than at 30 months). Negative reactivity at 36 months was unrelated to all aspects of conflict in the home. Effortful control was related only to conflict frequency. Children high in effortful control had less frequent conflicts with their mothers. Children with active temperaments were less likely to justify their side of an argument and more likely to aggravate than children without active temperaments. Active children also had fewer resolved conflicts with their mothers and were more likely to argue about destruction, aggression, independence, and space than children with less active temperaments. Last, children with active temperaments had mothers who were less likely to justify their side of an argument. Gender Differences Interesting gender differences emerged in several conflict elements in the lab.

Finally, boys (M 5 0.62, SD 5 0.24) were more likely than girls to aggravate (M 5 0.46, SD 5 0.19) their side of the argument in lab conflict. There were no gender differences in conflict elements in the home. Multivariate Relations Between Attachment and Conflict Frequency and Quality To predict the quality of conflict in the lab and home, a series of hierarchical regression models were built to predict conflict frequency, resolution, strategies, and themes. Because gender was related to multiple aspects of conflict, gender was entered first as a control in all the models. Parent education was also used as a control in the first step of the models predicting conflict resolution only because inspection of the bivariate relationships indicated that parent education was related only to conflict resolution. Concurrent attachment security and temperament were entered on the second step of all models. Because others have argued for the importance of considering both concurrent and longitudinal measures of attachment security in predicting outcomes (see Thompson, 1997), both 30- and 36-month attachment security scores were entered into the models predicting conflict outcomes in the home. Both the control variables and the variables of interest were entered simultaneously on each of the two steps in the models. Neither regression model predicting conflict frequency from attachment and temperament was significant. Thus, these models are not included in the tables. The regression models predicting conflict resolution at 30 and 36 months appear in Table 6. In predicting conflict resolution in the lab, gender, parent education, and negative reactivity made significant independent contributions to the overall significant model. In the lab, conflicts with girls were more likely to be resolved. In addition, there were more resolved conflicts in families with higher education levels. Last, children high in negative reactivity participated in fewer resolved conflicts than those Table 6 Hierarchical Regression Models Predicting Conflict Resolution in Home and Lab Conflicts Variable Conflict resolution in lab conflicts Gender Parent education Attachment security Negative reactivity Effortful control Activity level/impulsivity Step 1: R2 5 .22*, Step 2: R2 5 .39**; DR2 5 .17* Conflict resolution in home conflicts Gender Parent education Attachment security at 30 months Attachment security at 36 months Negative reactivity Effortful control Activity level/impulsivity Step 1: R2 5 .01, Step 2: R2 5 .18; DR2 5 .17y y b in full model .26* .29* .10 À.37* .01 À.01 À.06 .13 .06 .19 À.06 À.03 À.33* p , .10. *p , .05. **p , .01. 436 Laible, Panfile, and Makariev Table 8 Regression Models Predicting Conflict Strategies for Mother and Children in the Home b in full model Variable Justification Aggravation Compromise low in negative reactivity. In the model predicting conflict resolution in the home, the overall model was not significant. However, activity level/impulsivity made a significant independent contribution to this model. Conflict resolution in the home was less likely if the child had an active temperament than one that was less active. Regression models predicting mother and child conflict strategies in the lab and home conflicts appear in Tables 7 and 8. Both full models predicting maternal justification and aggravation in the lab were significant and largely parallel. Attachment security and activity level made significant independent contributions to both models. Mothers were more likely to justify and less likely to aggravate conflicts in the lab if their children were secure and not active or impulsive in their temperamental profiles. The model predicting maternal compromise in conflict in the lab was not significant. There was a slight trend, however, for mothers to compromise in conflicts with children high in effortful control and low in negative reactivity. Both full regression models predicting child conflict strategies in the lab were significant. In the model predicting child justification in the lab, only negative reactivity made a significant independent contribution.

In contrast, both negative reactivity and gender were important predictors of children's use of aggravation in lab conflicts. Girls and children low in negative reactivity were less likely to aggravate conflicts than boys and children high in negative reactivity. In the home conflicts, the models predicting maternal conflict strategies were largely parallel and all three full models were significant. Attachment security was the one significant predictor across the three models. Mothers of securely attached children were more likely to justify their side of an argument, more likely to compromise, and less likely to aggravate in conflict in the home than mothers of insecurely attached children. The pattern of relations was similar in the models predicting child justification and aggravation in conflict in the home. All three full models were significant and attachment security was the only variable that made a significant contribution to both models. Securely Mother - Toddler Conflict 437 attached children were more likely to justify their side of an argument and less likely to aggravate in conflict in the home when compared to insecure children. The regression models predicting conflict themes in the lab and home appear in Table 9. The regression model predicting conflicts over physical space in the lab was not significant and thus is not presented in the table. The other two full regression models were significant. In the model predicting conflicts over the child's destructive/aggressive behavior in the lab, only activity level/impulsivity made a significant independent contribution to the model. Highly active children evoked more conflicts over destructive and aggressive behavior in the lab than less active/impulsive children. In the regression model predicting conflicts over independence and possessions, gender and attachment security both made significant independent contributions to this model. Girls and securely attached children had more frequent conflicts over possessions and independence than boys and insecure children. The regression model predicting conflicts over facts and possessions in the home was not significant and thus is not presented in the tables. The other two Table 9 Regression Models Predicting Conflict Themes in Lab Conflicts models predicting conflict themes in the home were significant. Attachment security at 36 months and activity level were significant predictors of conflicts over destruction/aggression in the home. Securely attached children had fewer conflicts with their mothers over destructive and aggressive behavior than insecure children. Children who were highly active had more conflicts with mothers over these topics when compared with less active/impulsive children. Finally, the only significant independent predictor of conflicts over space and independence in the home was activity level. Highly active and impulsive children engaged in more conflict with mothers over space and independence than children who were less active and impulsive. Discussion The goal of this study was to examine the links between attachment security, child temperament, and the frequency and quality of mother - toddler conflict.

Mothers and toddlers were arguing on average between 20 and 25 times an hour at both assessment periods. There was also tremendous variability between dyads in the amount of conflict; some dyads argued as frequently as 55 times an hour and others as few as 4 times an hour. Despite this tremendous variability in conflict frequency, however, neither attachment security nor child temperament were strong predictors of conflict frequency. At first glance, it may seem surprising that attachment security was unrelated to conflict frequency. Certainly, a number of attachment theorists have argued and found evidence for the fact that securely attached children are more compliant and cooperative with caregivers (Kochanska, Aksan, & Carlson, 2005; Londerville & Main, 1981; Stayton, Hogan, & Ainsworth, 1971). It is important to keep in mind, however, that just because secure children are more compliant than insecure children, this does not necessarily translate into fewer daily conflicts between mothers and toddlers because as Eisenberg (1992) and others (Laible & Thompson, 2002) have suggested, conflict spans a much wider array of issues than merely child compliance. In fact, this study found evidence that mothers and children are frequently arguing over fairly innocuous topics such as factual assertions (see the Appendix for several sample conflicts over assertions and other issues). As a result, the findings from this study support that securely attached children may not be more submissive and compliant in all settings and may be just as likely to challenge mothers over certain issues as their insecure counterparts. Because secure children's internal working models contain expectations that caregivers will be responsive (especially in situations when negative emotion is present), secure children might be more willing to challenge mothers than insecure children under some circumstances (e.g., when pushing for autonomy). In other circumstances when more is at stake (e.g., in teaching or threatening situations), secure children might be more cooperative and less conflictual than insecure children (Matas et al., 1978). Therefore, the context may be an important determinant of under what circumstances secure children are more or less cooperative and more research is needed to explore this issue. Although attachment security did not relate to the frequency of mother - toddler conflict, child temperament was weakly related to the frequency of mother - toddler conflict. Bivariate relations suggested that conflict was more frequent with children who were highly active and impulsive and less frequent with children who were high in effortful control (although these links did not hold up in regression models). These findings are consistent with other research that has found that children who are low in self-regulation are more likely to initiate conflict with others (Rubin et al., 2003). In addition, children who are highly active and impulsive may engage in the types of behaviors (e.g., aggression) that evoke conflicts from mothers. The finding that highly active children in this study did engage in more frequent conflicts over aggression and destruction supports this idea. Attachment security was consistently related to the quality of conflict between secure mothers and their children, particularly to the conflict strategies that were being used by mothers and children. In the lab conflict, mothers of secure children were more likely than those mothers of insecure children to justify their side of an argument and not aggravate it. In the home conflicts, both mothers and children in secure dyads were more likely to justify their side of an argument and not aggravate it (compared to both members of an insecure dyad). In addition, mothers of secure children were more likely to compromise in conflict with children at home. It is important to note that even though attachment security at 30 months had a bivariate relation with child justification and aggravation in the lab conflicts, the relation was weak enough that it did not hold in the regression models. It is not clear why attachment security was more strongly related to child conflict strategies in the home at 36 months than in the lab at 30 months. Certainly, one possibility is that attachment security is more related to children's use of conflict strategies a little later in development (i.e., at 36 months) when children begin to develop more sophisticated strategies. Other researchers found evidence for the idea that across the preschool years, children's ability to mitigate conflict through use of negotiation and reasoning improves (Klimes-Dougan & Kopp, 1999, and in line with this research, child justification in this study also went up across the 6-month period (although child compromise remained rare). Thus, attachment security may be more important as these conflict skills are developing (rather than before or after their development; see Thompson, 1999). The links that attachment security had with maternal and child conflict strategies are consistent with attachment theory. A number of attachment theorists have argued that because both partners in a secure dyad are presumed to have ''secure'' internal working models of their relationship and given the accessibility of these models to both partners in a secure dyad, Mother - Toddler Conflict 439 communication between the two is presumed to be more open, especially in situations like conflict that are often negatively charged (Bretherton, 1990; Laible, 2004; Thompson, Laible, & Ontai, 2003). Therefore, it is not surprising that the quality of communication in conflict is of better quality in secure than insecure dyads. In addition, because both partners of a secure relationship are committed to maintaining harmony in the relationship (Laible & Thompson, 2006; Thompson, 1997), both partners may feel obligated to provide a rationale during conflict, in order to explain to the other why they are refusing a request or challenging an assertion. Furthermore, maternal compromise in conflict is also likely to be important in maintaining a secure relationship and likely promotes the child's trust that even in the context of conflict, mothers are considering the child's perspective as well. Attachment security was also related to the types of conflicts that young children and their mothers were arguing about. Securely attached dyads were engaged in fewer conflicts surrounding the child's aggressive and destructive behavior at both time periods and engaged in more frequent conflicts about possessions and independence in the lab. Securely attached children have been found to be less aggressive than insecure children (Lyons-Ruth, 1996; Speltz, DeKlyen, & Greenberg, 1999; van IJzendoorn, 1997), which may partially account for the lower rates of conflicts about aggressive/destructive behavior among secure children than insecure children. In addition, it is also possible that secure dyads argue less about the child's destructive and aggressive behavior than insecure dyads because secure children have internalized their parents' values regarding appropriate behavior (see Kochanska & Thompson, 1997). It is not entirely clear why secure dyads were having more conflicts over possessions and independence in the lab. It may be that mothers of secure children pick their battles, arguing with children over the topics that they feel are important at this time period. In addition, secure toddlers may feel more comfortable pushing for autonomy than their insecure counterparts (Matas et al., 1978). Clearly, more research into the types of arguments that secure and insecure dyads are having is needed. Aspects of child temperament were also linked with the quality of mother - toddler conflict, especially in the lab. At 30 months, children's negative reactivity and activity level were important in shaping the quality of mother - toddler conflict in the lab. Children who were high in negative reactivity at 30 months had more unresolved conflict in the lab, and were more likely to aggravate conflict, and less likely to justify their side of an argument in the lab. Children who are high in negative emotionality may be more likely to experience negative emotions in the context of conflict. As a result, these children may not be able to muster the cognitive resources that they need to justify their side of an argument. It is also possible that when faced with negative emotion in the context of conflict, mothers may be more likely to drop the issue to keep the child's distress within manageable limits. Whereas negative reactivity was more strongly related to children's behavior in conflict in the lab, activity level was more strongly related to mother's behavior in conflict episodes in the home. In the lab, mothers were less likely to justify their side of an argument and were more likely to aggravate in conflict with children who were highly active/ impulsive than with those who were low in this quality. Because aspects of child temperament have been shown to affect maternal behavior in a variety of contexts (Rothbart & Bates, 1998), this relationship is not surprising. The links between the temperament and the quality of mother - child communication in conflict is consistent with at least one other study that found that child temperament affected the quality of mother - child discourse. Smolak (1986) found that mothers were more repetitive and more directive with toddlers who were less capable of maintaining long episodes of sustained play. Both the current study and that of Smolak suggest that mothers may have to take different strategies with children who are highly active/impulsive and be more directive (e.g., ''clean-up now'') and less rationale (e.g., ''let's clean up before we play with something else, so we have plenty of space'') in communicating with children who are not able to sustain attention long enough to process lengthy maternal messages. Activity level was also related to the themes that mothers and children were arguing over. In both the lab and the home, highly active children were engaging in more conflicts with mothers over aggressive and destructive behavior than less active children. In addition, in the home, highly active children were also engaging in more frequent conflicts over space and independence. Highly active children may be engaging in more frequent conflicts over destructive and aggressive behavior because of the fact that children with this temperamental profile are more at risk for externalizing and other destructive behavior (see Hollander, 1995). In addition, because of their active and impulsive temperaments, these children might be more likely to push for autonomy even in situations that are not appropriate and to be in places that are forbidden. 440 Laible, Panfile, and Makariev Similar to attachment, the links between child temperament and conflict varied to some extent across setting. At 30 months in the lab, both negative reactivity and activity level had bivariate associations with the quality of mother - child conflict. By 36 months, conflict in the home tended to be more associated with activity level and impulsivity than with negative reactivity. Part of the explanation for these differences may have to do with the context. In the lab, the availability of the attractive, but forbidden toy shelf was especially frustrating for the toddlers in this study. Thus, children already prone toward negative reactivity may have been especially challenged by this task. As a result, children's emotionality may have been more influential in predicting children's use of conflict strategies in the lab than in the home, where household routines were already well established to keep children's frustration within manageable limits. However, it is also possible that as children develop better emotion regulation skills, negative reactivity is less influential in shaping conflict. Thus, part of the reason that negative reactivity may be less influential in shaping children's conflict strategies in the home at 36 months may have to do with the fact that children's emotion regulation skills had improved enough to allow even children prone to negative reactivity to manage the negative emotion inherent in some conflicts. Finally, interesting gender differences in conflict also emerged. In general, there were fewer unresolved conflicts between mothers and girls in the lab than between mothers and boys. In addition, mothers submitted more frequently in conflicts with girls and girls were more likely than boys to submit in conflicts with mothers as well. Finally, boys were more likely than girls to aggravate their side of the argument in lab conflicts at 30 months. Although in many respects, these findings are consistent with the traditional gender roles that are socialized in young girls (e.g., submissiveness) and boys (e.g., assertiveness; Maccoby, 1990), it is unclear why the gender differences were found only in the lab. It is possible, however, that part of the reason for the findings may be context. Perhaps, gender roles were more apparent in the laboratory because it is a more public arena, and as a result, mothers and their young children felt more compelled to comply with gender norms in such a public setting. In addition, at the lab, conflict often centered on the rules of the lab (cleaning up and not touching the forbidden toy shelf), whereas home conflict spanned a greater array of topics. Thus, when mothers are forced to communicate someone else's rules to the child, perhaps mothers are more concerned with maintain- ing traditional gender roles than in home settings, in which they set the rules and routines. Like every study, the current one is not without limitations. The sample for this study was drawn from a primarily White, middle-class background. The nature and frequency of conflict is likely extremely different across different ethnic and cultural groups (Rudy & Grusec, 1999). In addition, it is important to point out that mothers were the sole reporters of attachment and temperament in this study and future research could benefit from including multiple reporters. Furthermore, because of the correlational nature of this study, causal interpretations must be made cautiously. As a result, the direction of effects is not entirely clear. Based on attachment theory, it seems plausible to argue that the security of attachment shapes the quality of the conflict in the dyad; the opposite possibility cannot be ruled out (i.e., that the quality and frequency of mother - toddler conflict shapes a child's feelings of security). In fact, given that negative emotions are frequent in mother - toddler conflict, it does seem that the ways in which mothers handle conflict might also be important for shaping attachment security. Ultimately, the links between attachment and conflict are therefore likely bidirectional. Longitudinal research on this issue is needed to clarify the direction of effects.
