Have you ever played a thumb-war? You and your friend wrestle to pin each other's thumbs down so they can't move. Nobody ever just asks the other person to let them win. We tend to use aggression rather than cooperation as our first option. Children who watch us learn that pattern, too. What can you do to show children other options?
Think of some questions that you have about conflict resolution and write them down. What do you do when children have conflicts with each other? What do you do when a child has a conflict with you?
What were the child care providers' solutions to conflicts? What did they say you should avoid? Take a moment to think about how you respond to conflicts. How does your practice compare to what you heard?
As you watch, look for things that the child care provider does that you would find helpful. Should you punish a child for fighting? How else could you respond? Consider what you do with your own children.
What is your plan for dealing with conflict? How are your practices the same as what you saw? How are they different? What is the difference between punishment and conflict resolution?
Write down any new questions you have. Prepare to watch how the panelists react to the video. Keep your questions and the active learning questions in mind and take notes on one topic that interests you.
Did anyone notice the same things as you? Did they agree with you? What is the most important piece of advice you heard?
Strategies for dealing with conflict:
Let children help create their own solutions (making rules, taking turns)
Know children's limitations (e.g. with language) and address their needs and feelings accordingly
Don't ask why they did something; Coax them into talking by making observations
