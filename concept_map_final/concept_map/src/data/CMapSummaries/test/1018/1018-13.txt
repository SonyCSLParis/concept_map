A vast majority of students preparing themselves for a higher education are in need of no credit check student loans. After years of preparation, discipline, and hard work in high school and elementary school, many worthy students are facing the single greatest hurdle in realizing their dream: escalating tuition costs. Without an expansive work history, credit score, or bill payment record, and thereby little or no credit history, today's students must aggressively pursue viable options to meet the financial demands of acquiring a higher education. Fortunately, no credit check student loans are readily available.
The options for student loans without a credit check seems daunting during their initial appearance, however this is truly not the case. In fact, all loans from the Federal Direct Student Loan Program require absolutely no credit check, and except in instances of previous Federal Direct Student Program Loans being in default, there are literally no restrictions on access to these loans based on credit history or score.
The benefits of loans not requiring student credit scores include:
• Prevents exorbitant interest rates • Circumvents cosigner requirements • Facilitates covering an otherwise insurmountable cost of college • Allows the development of student credit
Private lending institutions, which are unaffiliated with the Department of Education, regularly offer student loans in lieu of a built-up credit history. Students and their parents can access these loans almost instantly throughout the academic year unlike traditional government student loan award money. In addition, lenders frequently offer competitive rates similar to those offered by the government as the result of price competition between the two entities over academic lending. In many instances, no credit check student loans actually provide students with their first introduction into the world of credit ratings. In order to appreciate fully the opportunity to receive no credit check student loans, students should understand the lifelong implications associated with one's credit rating. Institutions, organizations, and agencies extending this type of loan afford students a foundation to establish a satisfactory credit rating when preparing for the future. There are various stipulations attached to these loans and consultation with an applications specialist is necessary.
The two of the most popular Federal Direct Loan Program awards are Perkins Loans and Stafford Loan, which the Department of Education reports 2.9 million students opted to borrow for the academic year ending in 2008. The primary mandate for both of these loans is providing an opportunity to students experiencing financial hardships that would otherwise prohibit or exclude attending an institution of higher learning. They are eligible to be used in conjunction with grants or any other sources of funding, which students may qualify for in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, as well as any other university provided financial aid package or personally achieved scholarships. The Perkins and Stafford Loans offer below market interest rates, 5.0% and 6.8% respectively, and afford generous repayment terms for students and their grateful parents.
Being prepared is essential. The benefits granted are highlighted within the array of simple qualification requirements; no credit scores, no cosigner, and liberal repayment terms accent the ease of qualifying. A consultation with an application specialist will stipulate any additional terms based upon the loan program selected to best meet your individual needs.
