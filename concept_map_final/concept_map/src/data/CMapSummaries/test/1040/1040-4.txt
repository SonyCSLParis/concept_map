Parents, teachers, school administrators, and doctors all know that children develop at different rates. Furthermore, children and adults all have individual strengths and weaknesses when it comes to language, mathematics, athletics, social interaction, emotional well-being, motivation, and organization. But beyond these natural variations, there are children and adults who suffer from learning disabilities : actual disorders that affect the ways by which information is taken in and processed in different parts of the brain . These disorders lead to specific difficulties with tasks such as listening, reading, writing, reasoning, and calculating, and also coordination, self-control, and attention.
This article describes several types of learning disabilities, as well as an indirectly related condition: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ADHD is not officially classified as a learning disability, it shares many of the same causes, symptoms, and treatments.
What Are Learning Disabilities?
"Learning disability" (LD) is a broad term for a cluster of disorders that have a wide array of causes and symptoms and occur with varying levels of severity. In most cases, learning disabilities are first identified in school, where a child may appear to be lagging behind his or her classmates in the development of some particular skill. A child who usually performs well and works diligently may suddenly be performing poorly and feeling badly about the inability to master new tasks. Since there are dozens of potential reasons for such situations, those who diagnose learning disabilities have had to be very specific about what does and does not constitute an LD.
Definition and Diagnosis
When the term "learning disability" was first used in 1962, it displaced a veritable lexicon of vague, misguided, and even derogatory labels, terms ranging from "organic brain damage" to "slow learner." Since then, several definitions of learning disabilities have been proposed. Interestingly enough, one common feature of these definitions is their attempt to say what LDs are not. Thus, LDs do not include learning problems that are related to physical issues such as being blind, hard-of-hearing, deaf, speech-impaired, or mobility-disabled. Emotional trauma and mental retardation are also excluded, as are disadvantages determined to be the result of various environmental, cultural, or economic factors. These and other circumstances may accompany LDs, but are not in and of themselves considered by authorities to be learning disabilities.
What remains is a set of conditions characterized mainly by their symptoms, and apparently derived from some intrinsic central-nervous-system dysfunction that occurs across the entire life span. LDs are usually diagnosed either by observing developmental lag-a child reaches certain developmental milestones more slowly than others at the same age-or by comparing a child's achievement to his or her potential (as measured by standardized examinations such as IQ tests).
The specific causes of LDs, as well as their biological processes, remain largely unknown. In some cases, learning disabilities may be hereditary ; even if older family members were never diagnosed, the conditions may have occurred in earlier generations. Other likely candidates for causing LDs are pregnancy and childbirth problems, fetal alcohol syndrome, pediatric AIDS, and other illness, injury, or drug use during pregnancy. Childhood head injuries, abuse, malnutrition, or exposure to poisons such as lead are other possibilities. All of these causes, and others that may remain undiscovered, can affect brain development and biochemical processes in such a way as to lead to LDs.
Whatever their causes, learning disabilities manifest themselves as an inability to use and manage different kinds of sensory information efficiently. Visual stimuli, for example, may be confusing because the person cannot distinguish between shapes and colors (the difference between a b and a d, for example), or pick out the desired visual information from a field of stimuli (identifying a destination on a map). Motor skills related to vision, such as hand-eye coordination, may be impaired and result in everything from trouble using scissors to problems crossing a room. Equally significant are problems in processing auditory information: distinguishing sounds and words, isolating important sounds from background noise, or remembering what has been heard. Any or all of these fundamental tasks necessary for language use may be affected by LDs.
Types of Learning Disabilities
By and large, the various types of learning disabilities are characterized in terms of the skills and abilities that present difficulties for the person being diagnosed.
Developmental Speech and Language Disorders
Many children experience a period of difficulty in speaking or understanding speech; persistent and severe problems in these areas qualify as learning disabilities. An expressive disorder describes a difficulty in finding the correct words, using the accurate names of objects, or using language at the level of complexity associated with a particular age group. A person suffering from a receptive disorder has difficulty making sense of what he or she hears. As a result, the person may appear unresponsive or inattentive, and may have trouble following directions or understanding shades of meaning in a social interaction.
Academic Skills Disorders
Often LDs are identified as children start school and begin to confront the complex nature of academic tasks. Dyslexia , probably the best-known learning disability, is a reading disorder resulting from difficulties in processing written information. Dyslexia sufferers may have trouble comprehending what they read, and they often confuse words or-in the most widely known symptom of the condition-confuse the order of letters within a word (or the order of digits in a number). Dyslexia can lead to problems with spelling, pronunciation, recognizing rhyming words, and understanding unusual language uses, as in jokes and slang. A related disorder is dysgraphia , which is characterized by difficulty with handwriting. Dysgraphia can lead to problems with spelling and grammar, but also with broader issues of composition and expressing ideas on paper. Some researchers consider writing-specific motor difficulties-trouble holding a pencil or pen, severe handwriting problems, inability to write within lines and margins-to be a part of dysgraphia, while others link those symptoms with motor disabilities in general.
Dyscalculia sufferers have difficulty processing mathematics -related information. Anything from mathematical concepts to computation, telling time, reading a schedule, using money, playing music , and playing cards or board games may pose a problem for a person with dyscalculia. People tend to compensate for dyscalculia by developing advanced language skills. An interesting aside: most LDs lead to some form of compensatory learning.
Other Disorders
Nonverbal learning disabilities (NLDs) represent a small percentage of all LDs. NLDs are characterized by academic problems (specifically with mathematics) as well as organizational problems. These are often difficult to diagnose, since children with NLDs compensate for them early on by developing verbal skills and subsequently performing well at many academic tasks. NLDs can nevertheless be extremely frustrating and even debilitating. Dyspraxia is a motor disorder in which messages from the brain are not properly transmitted to the body. The resulting lack of coordination can make simple actions such as waving hello difficult; actions with multiple parts-for example, putting on clothes in the proper order-can present even greater challenges. Other NLDs consist of problems with visual and spatial abilities; these can lead to social difficulties, especially as a result of having only a minimal ability to recognize nonverbal social cues, such as body language and facial expressions.
Related Disorders-ADHD
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) leads to similar academic and social challenges for children. The cause of most cases of ADHD is unknown; some cases have been linked to genetic factors. ADHD is associated with three symptoms: inattention, or trouble focusing on a task; hyperactivity, or extreme restlessness and fidgeting; and impulsiveness, or a tendency to act without considering the consequences. ADHD children do not have a lower intelligence than their peers, but they can develop low self-esteem as a result of being labeled a "problem child," or simply from the frustration of not being able to attend to work or express their intelligence. Many adults have attention-deficit disorder (ADD). Symptoms are similar to those of ADHD except that the adults generally are not hyperactive. Treatment of ADHD and ADD generally includes medication and therapy.
Other Aspects of LDs
How widespread are learning disabilities, how are they treated and by whom, and what does the future hold in understanding them?
In recent years, the number of school-age children diagnosed with learning disabilities has hovered around 3 million children-approximately 5 percent of all U.S. youngsters in that age range. Some estimates put the number of people in the general population who should be diagnosed with ADHD at around 5 percent as well. All of these disabilities are several times more likely to be found in males than females, perhaps because of differences in male maturation rates and specific brain structure.
Diagnosing LDs and ADHD has become increasingly controversial, with some parents and educators expressing fears that the overlabeling of children leads to a victim mentality, blames children for what is actually the failure of schools to properly educate them, and siphons funds from those students who really need them. To some extent, there is a real danger of designating students as LD simply because they perform poorly. But there are legitimate reasons for the sharp increase in diagnoses of LDs: more awareness and understanding of the various disorders, and the growing social acceptance of LD children. In any case, it is certain that for many, LDs are very real, and that the benefits of proper diagnosis can be life-changing.
Although there is no known cure for LDs, there is the assurance that people with all kinds of disabilities can learn and succeed. Special education is a fundamental part of dealing with LDs, whether in separate groupings or as a part of mainstream classrooms. Every identified learning-disabled student is entitled to an Individualized Educational Program (IEP)-a student-specific plan for addressing his or her difficulties and encouraging his or her strengths. Strategies could involve creating a distraction-free work space, breaking down instructions into simpler parts, removing the time constraints during tests, keeping predictable schedules for activities, or practicing metacognitive dialogues in which the student articulates the ways in which he or she is experiencing the learning process. Since LDs are often caused by a gap in processing sensory information, the student may also benefit from applying different senses than usual for learning, such as listening to books on tape, or communicating with sign language. These educational approaches could be combined with behavior therapy, psychotherapy addressing self-esteem issues, or support groups.
Medication has been used with some success in treating LDs, but it is more commonly associated with treatment of ADHD. Stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine or Dextrostat), and pemoline (Cylert) have dramatic effects in reducing hyperactivity and improving the ability to focus. Although debates rage over prescribing daily medication to children, the prevailing opinion seems to be that in proper doses, these drugs are not addictive, have only minor side effects, and rarely cease to be effective. In any case, medication alone does not constitute a complete treatment for ADHD, nor does it deserve the credit when a person with ADHD works hard to achieve.
Research by organizations such as the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has focused on the better understanding of LDs and related disorders. Using ever-improving brain-imaging technology, researchers are studying how the brain works when it carries out the processing tasks associated with learning and thinking. Researchers are looking back to the causes of learning disabilities-genetic, developmental, illness-related-as well as forward toward new, more-effective treatments.
Special services for children with learning disabilities were first mandated by law in 1975. Currently, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990 assures a public education to school-age children with learning disabilities, which includes IEPs (amendments to the act provide services for children beginning at age 5). Some services for children with learning disabilities are now being provided under the auspices of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These services are even provided without individualized educational programs in place, but the schools must make provisions for the LD in a meaningful manner.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also requires that provisions be made for various learning disabilities. This is of importance as there are growing numbers of LD students entering post-secondary education. Recently, many colleges and universities have initiated programs for the provision of service to learning-disabled students, and indeed to make reasonable accommodations for LD students or employees. Similar laws extend protection and aid for ADHD students. Support also derives from organizations such as the NIMH, the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA), and the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), among other groups.
