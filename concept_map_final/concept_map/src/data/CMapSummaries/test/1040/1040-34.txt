Social Skills
When it comes to understanding learning disabilities, the focus in the field has been mostly on cognitive factors. Many studies and professionals try to understand, assess and remediate problems that the LD individual experiences in school and work which may prevent them from fitting in with their peers. Until recently, little focus has been dedicated to the psychological welfare of these same individuals who because of their cognitive deficits are more likely to experience emotional and psychosocial difficulties, both in their interactions with others as well as within themselves (self concept, self esteem):psychosocial difficulties which may consequently serve to worsen the cognitive delays already prevalent. It is important to distinguish that although serious intra- and inter-personal problems such as delinquency, difficulty socializing and forming relationships, and depression are associated with those who have LD, these problems do not necessarily always coexist with LD. Having an LD is not in itself sufficient to elicit social difficulties, being diagnosed with an LD is only considered a potential risk factor for developing such social difficulties. The presence of this risk factor interacts with the protective factors in the individual's life along with other potential risk factors and thereby facilitates or impedes their social adjustment. If the individual has a number of risk factors and a weak system of protective factors then they will be more prone to psychosocial maladjustments. However, if the reverse is true and the protective factors are stronger than that of the risk factors, then the effect is less. Protective and risk factors may originate from an individual's internal (perseverance, motivation, frustration, self esteem) as well as external characteristics (community, family, school). For instance, a child with a LD may become frustrated as a result of repeated failures at school but the presense of a supportive family network or the presence of a certain "island of competence" (something that they do well eg. sports or a particular subject area) may counteract the repercussions of his negative school life resulting in a fairly well adjusted child.
