Private Learning Disability Schools In PA
Children with learning difficulties may struggle in school for several years before they are formally diagnosed with disabilities. They may become frustrated due to lengthy homework sessions, ongoing organization problems and an inability to keep up with classmates. They may even begin to believe that they are not as smart as their peers.
Parents who see their children struggling to read or keep up in class should seek the professional evaluation of a school psychologist or education specialist . Once diagnosed, children can identify their strengths and begin to practice strategies to help effectively manage their learning disabilities. Some children may also qualify for private schools and special reading programs at no cost to their families.
Symptoms of Learning Disabilities
Signs of learning disabilities are varied but may include:
Difficulty comprehending or following instructions
Short-term memory problems
Tendency to reverse letters or words in a sentence
Failure to master spelling words, math logic or reading skills
Inability to become organized or remember tasks
Problems with attention span
In addition to the learning disability itself, a child may suffer from stress, anxiety or depression as a result of her continual frustration. These emotional and psychological issues can further exacerbate existing learning difficulties.
