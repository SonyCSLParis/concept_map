A: The same way you would teach a child without a learning disability! Teach them what they are capable of learning. Teach them to buy things at Wal-Mart, to keep up with their own money, things of that nature. Teach them at THEIR level. If they are ready for Algebra, then go for it. If they are ready for subtraction, go for it. Don't hold them back just because of their disability. It may take you longer, but it's worth the time!

My heart is heavy
by David Parkerson
My heart is heavy this month because of all the parents I have talked to already this year whose kids are struggling with "ADHD " or "ADD." After years of working to help parents bring their kids back home, and hearing one success story after another of kids that no longer needed the medication, I am even more convinced that this is a grossly over diagnosed problem. There is so much to be said and I realized fully that God can AND DOES use the medications sometimes to help a young man or woman. So I want to be clear up front that I do believe there are legitimate needs. However, I also believe in my heart that God created the hyper kids for a reason. I should know, I'm one of them! We don't need medication, we just need MORE TO DO!
Imagine a farmer with a large field back in the days before fancy machinery. He's gone out shopping for another horse to pull his plow. When he finds a big strong animal the seller warns him, "Now let me tell you...this animal is hyper! He has loads of energy and will probably plow your field in half the time." To which he adds with a chuckle, "But it's going to be more work for you, my farmer friend, more work for you."
Now the farmer has a decision to make. He can take the hyper horse and the additional challenge of managing him or he can decide on a more timid creature and less weariness for himself at the end of each day. The first will produce twice the results but the second would be twice as easy.
Now I realize no analogy is perfect. But I hope this demonstrates the problem many of us face. (I say "us" because our 2 yr. old is already showing strong signs of being just like his daddy!) I'm pretty certain that somewhere in the processes of compulsory schooling it would be suggested that Nathan be given medication to help him with his "problem." (April just added, "I have no doubt about that!") But we are going to make the decision with him and all of our hyper little ones to be more weary at the end of each day. The trade off will be that one day Nathan will be writing these emails to you and probably running just about everything. And he'll be plowing our fields in half the time.
So if you are feeling weary 'cause your horse is sooo hyper, just hang in there. They just need more to do. And one day, Lord willing, they'll be doing it for you!
A: Many parents have found that kids need a little room to overcome learning difficulties. Notice I did not call it "disabilities." I believe MOST problems or delays are NOT disabilities but difficulties.
Nothing leads to success like success. Perhaps giving him or her some more time and the freedom to read on his own, without a "teacher" forcing him to do it, might help.
Many kids don't learn to read until they are older. George Washington Carver didn't learn to read until he was eleven! I've talked to several families over the years whose kids didn't fully start reading until they were nine or ten. And I've talked to dozens of parents whose kids didn't read until seven or eight.
The problem is the traditional system believes that 5 is the age which EVERY child should start reading. But GOD MAKES ALL DIFFERENT kinds of kids, that read (and do everything) at ALL different ages. I think it's silly to think that every child should be doing the same thing at the same age. Look at how diverse God's creation is and it makes perfect sense that we are just as diverse.
Therefore I would just bring him home and give him some room. One parent I talked to a couple of years ago with a "problem" like this told me that she just started reading TO her son everyday. Then one day when he was ready he just picked up the book and started reading it. He knew how to read, he just needed to come to the time when he was ready and no one was breathing down his neck trying to force him.

An Excerpt from: Homeschooling for Success
How Parents can Create a Superior Education for their Child
For younger children, the emphasis is usually on building a solid foundation in reading, writing, and basic math. Where schools believe in starting formal learning as early as possible, most homeschoolers believe in delaying formal studies until the child is seven or older. This allows the child to mature physically and emotionally before she is asked to sit down and study.

Beware Experts' Advice
If there is one area that causes concern for even the most experienced parent, it's helping our kids learn to read. And with good reason: We are told reading is an area best left to the experts, who advise us about what age our children should begin, what method to use, and how long it should take. We're told tests and reports are vital to the learning process. The trouble is, most of this advice is simply not true.
The Right Age to Read
By kindergarten, most schooled children are working their way through "reading readiness" programs and are expected to know and understand basic concepts of reading. But is this really the best age to start reading?
It's not, according to Louise Bates Ames, director of research at the Gesell Institute of Child Development and author of more than 15 books on childhood development and behavior. In A Developmental Approach to Reading Problems, Ames states that "a delay in reading instruction would be a preventative measure in avoiding nearly all reading failure." This view is shared by Dr. Raymond and Dorothy Moore, considered by many to be the grandparents of the modern homeschool movement. In Better Late Than Early and School Can Wait, the Moores present well-researched arguments that children aren't physiologically ready for formal reading activities until the age of 8 or 10. Waiting helps children develop maturity and logic skills and prevents frustration and discouragement.
Helping Your Homeschooler Learn to Read: Part TWO

What You Can Do
Read to your children every day. The Read-Aloud Handbook by Jim Trelease is a classic. Trelease explains how reading aloud stimulates your child's imagination and leads to the desire to read independently.
Take time to read yourself. A child learns by watching his parents. If your child sees you making reading a regular part of your life, chances are he will do the same. If you sit in front of the TV for hours, don't be surprised when your child wants to do it, too.
Don't start the learning process too early and don't push if they aren't ready. There should be no tears or reluctance. Allowed to learn at their own pace, homeschooled children often don't begin to read until 8 or 9 years old. Mary Griffith, author of The Homeschooling Handbook, says that late reading (even as late as 12) is not much of a handicap to homeschoolers. "Because schools rely so heavily on text-based instruction, we tend to forget there are other ways to acquire knowledge" Griffith writes. "The late reader frequently blossoms suddenly into a capable and independent reader and the late-reading homeschooler remains an eager and interested learner."

"...Instead I leaned heavily on the words of John Holt. He said that many kids, especially boys, when left to their own learning pace, would not read until eleven to fifteen years of age. This idea was hard for me to believe before this, but now I embraced it. But even then, I still didn't believe that anyone who couldn't read by the age of fifteen was of normal intelligence."

Dr. Dobson Responds
"Many of our friends have begun to home school their children with seemingly positive results. My wife and I are considering this possibility as well but aren't quite sure. What are your views on this educational option? What would you do in my shoes?"
Dr. Dobson Responds:
"This is a subject on which my mind has changed dramatically over the years. There was a time when I subscribed wholeheartedly to the notion that early formal childhood education was vital to the child's intellectual well-being. That was widely believed in the sixties and seventies. I no longer accept that idea and favor keeping kids with their parents for a longer time. Dr. Raymond Moore, author of School Can Wait and an early leader of the home-schooling movement, had a great influence on me in this regard. The research now validates the wisdom of keeping boys and girls in a protected environment until they have achieved a greater degree of maturity. Not only do they benefit emotionally from that delay, but they typically make better progress academically. That's why home-schooled individuals often gain entrance to the most prestigious universities and colleges in the country. What parents can teach young children in informal one-on-one interactions surpasses what their little minds can absorb sitting among twenty-five age-mates in a classroom."
Q: When should we choose 'Special Education' and will there be a diploma?'
A: First of all, since you are more like a private tutor or mentor than a classroom teacher we believe ALL education should be "specialized," whether your student has a difficulty or not. "Special Education" is a term used to identify kids who are too far behind (or too far ahead) of the "norm." They do not fit the "average" and so the regular teachers cannot accommodate them. Therefore, they are put into special classes (either Resource or some advanced class) to attempt to meet their "special" needs. Since your classroom is so much smaller (our average teacher to student ratio is 1 to 1.7), and because you do not necessarily need to identify your student out of an entire classroom, you most likely do not need the labal Special Education.
Many children that are placed in special ed classes are in there ONLY because they are in a mass school system. By nature of design a large system cannot give the type of attention that is often required of students that do not fit the "norm" or "average." Furthermore, children are always learning on different levels. You know this. Your student may be very strong in math, but may struggle in reading. Or may be "ahead" in one subject while "behind" in another. THIS IS NORMAL. Children are not standardized. You don't need to label them as "Special Ed", you just teach them on their level, and adapt and change that level per subject and per year. Our philosophy is that, since we have such a great teacher-to-student ratio, ALL students of HLA should recieve specialized education in this sense, no matter what grade they are in for record keeping purposes.
With that said there are a few instances in when the term Special Education should be used. If the student has been diagnosed with a learning disability that he or she will stuggle with for the rest of their lives, and this learning disability requires that you not follow the normal grades, then choose Special Ed as his or her grade level. If the student simply has a learning difficulty, one which will be overcome with time, the he or she is not Special Ed. I'm convinced that many times the term Special Ed is placed with too much haste, causing the student to "conform to" the expectations of the label. Therefore, it is much safer in the long run to assume your student simply has a difficulty at first and save the label Special Ed as a last resort.
If your student is transferring from another school that had him or her listed Special Ed consider dropping the label and taking a fresh look at education. Again the label is not necessary since your classroom is so much smaller and because you do not need to identify your student out of an entire classroom.
Finally, will my child get a diploma? Yes. If you have a high school student that will NOT fulfill the requirements of the Goal-Based Courses of Study, but still wants to receive a diploma, list them as Special Education. The diploma they receive will have not read "Special Education " on it, unless you want us to add it, in which case just let us know. You, as the parent, may request the diploma at any point you are satisfied that they have reached the end of your own requirements/goals for them. This varies so much depending on the student that we will not make this call for you. However, we do insist that your son or daughter be beyond compulsory attendance age in your state before we will grant a diploma. To request a diploma go to the Member Login and submit a request in the Request Manager.
A: Start by asking the question "Does my child actually have ADD, ADHD, ODD, Conduct disorder, etc. or is he or she simply a normal child in an institutional setting which has very little flexibility?
Chris Davis, in "How Not to Teach Like the Public Schools," suggests that modern schooling utilizes an assembly line method of schooling "to teach 1/12 of the whole per year." He reveals that in such a system, one which originated during the industrial revolution, Children are treated more like buckets on a conveyor belt than vastly diverse individuals. If a child will not sit still and allow each portion of the 12 years of school (portions have been measured and divided for efficiency) to be carefully poured in then the problem is not with the method but with the child. The defective bucket ("hyper" child) must be MADE to hold still or he or she will be required to return to the beginning of the conveyor belt.
But perhaps it is not ABNORMAL for children to squirm and fidget. Maybe the problem is NOT with the children. Perhaps there is a problem with the METHOD of mass compulsory schooling and the inevitable systematic treatment of diverse personality and learning styles that is a result.
DISCLAIMER: We realize that this is a very difficult and emotional issue for many parents, teachers, administrators, and especially, the children. Encouraging the following resources and ideas are not meant to offend anyone. However, there is a growing concern among parents who are crying out for answers. These parents feel deep in their gut that there must be another way. Many Christian parents refuse to accept that God made a mistake with their children by making them "too hyper." History reveals that many of the best minds and leaders our country has known would be medicated in today's schools ( http://borntoexplore.org/famous.htm ). Therefore, the resources below are provided for your consideration. You may find, like many parents who are taking their children off of medication, that your children are actually normal!
Struggling with "ADHD " or "ADD

Most ADHD books rehash the same worn out theories and treatments. Instead, ADHD: A Path to Success offers a new and refreshing perspective on attention deficit disorder that makes sense with your own personal daily experience.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is not a deficit, defect or neurological disorder. Rather, it is a highly refined, short-term coping skill that backfires in the long-run. Children adapt to unpleasant situations the same way adults do, by building emotional defenses.
According to conventional wisdom, the traits of attention deficit disorder (ADD and ADHD) are an error of nature. But was Thomas Edison the world's most famous inventor in spite of his hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness or because of it? Why are ADHD traits so similar to traits shared by "highly creative individuals" as well as to the ENTP, or "Inventor," temperament?
Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD has been an adult and child neurologist, in private practice, for 35 years. Making "disease" (real diseases--epilepsy, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, etc.) or "no disease" (emotional, psychological, psychiatric) diagnoses daily, he has discovered and described real, bona fide diseases.
The reason I speak of a hoax in the case of "attention deficit disorder" is that there is no such "mental disorder" to "diagnose" and "treat." And the reason I speak of a great hoax is that the less competent medical practitioners use this phony "diagnosis" as a warrant to "treat" millions of school children (over 5,000,000) per year by intoxicating them with brain-disabling narcotics.
Broken Brains or Flawed Studies? A critical review of ADHD imaging studies by Jonathan Leo, Ph.D and David Cohen, Ph.D methodically demonstrates how scientifically flawed methodology undermines the integrity and claimed findings of over 30 imaging studies that are the basis for psychiatry's claims that children with ADHD have brain abnormalities.
A psychologist challenges current diagnoses of Attention Deficit Disorder and shows how to deal with hyperactivity and short attention spans through practical strategies for making the most of a child's vitality and creativity. 25,000 first printing.
Chris Mercogliano has been a teacher at the Albany Free School since 1973, and co-director since 1985. His writing has appeared in numerous publications and he is the author of Making It Up As We Go Along. He lives in Albany, New York.
Teaching the Restless profiles a handful of Free School students, six boys and three girls. All were either labeled and drugged in their previous schools, or would have been had they not thrown in their lot with the Free School. Speaking both to parents who worry that their kids cannot attend classes without drugs and to educators who wonder how to best teach these hyperactive kids, Teaching the Restless should bring new hope into an overcharged debate.
This inciteful article by Wendy Priensnitz captures the very heart of the so called "problem" of attention deficits.
"Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat, often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected, often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate, often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly, is often "on the go", often talks excessively."
Sound like the kids you know? Then those kids "must" be mentally ill, because that is the definition of hyperactivity found in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). If you read it closely, the definition is laden with words that are judgmental, or at least reflect an adult's - often a teacher's - preference for quiet and order. And, although hyperactivity and its ilk are referred to as "learning disabilities", these characteristics seem not really to get in the way of true learning. Rather, they might describe the normally active, curious unschooled child! By some estimates, the number of children diagnosed with hyperactivity and other "problems" such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is upwards of five million. In addition, is has been estimated by the psychiatric profession that 60 percent of children with the "disorder" carry their symptoms into adulthood! Some say that four percent of adults in the United States, more than eight million people, have ADHD.
Some doctors and parents have found that many of the behaviors falling under the Psychiatric Association's various definitions of childhood mental disorders can be caused by allergies to certain foods, food additives or environmental factors, or by poor nutrition. Recent studies and clinical trials conducted at Purdue University in the U.S. and Surrey and Oxford in the U.K. indicate that ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia (Clumsy Child Syndrome) may have a nutritional basis. However, the pharmaceutical industry, which manufactures products like Ritalin and Dexedrine to medicate these so-called illness, has a vested interest in helping doctors diagnose and treat them.
A survey recently conducted by the Harris polling company for Eli Lilly and Company found that parents report their children have ADHD "symptoms" around the clock but physicians only treat many of their patients for symptoms during school hours. So the push is apparently on to educate doctors about parents' "need" for further drugging of their children.
"Managing ADHD during school is important, but we cannot overlook that managing ADHD during family time plays a critical role as well," said Richard W. Geller, M.D. of Norwich Pediatric Group, Norwich, Conn., and an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, commenting on the survey results.
The writers provide "sound answers on preventing and overcoming behavioral, emotional and learning problems, including ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), Conduct Disorder and Toruettes Syndrome." Part One is a psychological and historical analysis of the problem. It's pretty technical at times. But stick it out or skip to Part Two.
Here's an excerpt from chapter 11:
"Research confirms once again that discipline leads to security, and not to stress, anger or depression, or to "mental illnesses," as the Mental Hygiene Movement has persuaded millions of parents and teachers to believe. It is the lack of discipline that leads to feelings of insecurity, as well as to many of the so-called mental illnesses - such as ADHD, ODD, and CD."
When I was a teacher I noticed that there were kids that were quiet, introverts and kids that were loud, extroverts. I must confess, in a classroom situation, where progress depends on order, I preferred the introverts. I found myself wanting to give those wiggly, chatterbox teenagers some Ritalin! I now understand why the drug has been so over diagnosed.
When I was in school in the 70s my teachers dealt with my "attention deficits" by whipping me 'till I couldn't sit down. As I look back I am so thankful that I received those swift punishments, without them my behavior would have gone unchecked. Today, however, Ritalin has replaced the paddle in the schools and in many homes in leu of "progress."
But I believe that God made those loud, extroverts for a reason and purpose in His kingdom. These are the types of personalities that grow up to preach, run businesses, and dream up new inventions. I shudder when I consider how many high energy kids we've lost to years of "drug therapy" because they had a "mental illness." But I'm very excited to hear so often of parents who have said, "We started home educating and I realized that my son didn't need drugs he just needed more stimulation and some patient one-on-one teaching and tutoring. Our family is so much happier."
A: Absolutely! In fact, many families find that home education is the best IEP there is. Why? Because it is TRULY individualized! There are many degrees of special needs but imagine if the school system had enough special education teachers that every child or two would have their very own teacher for four hours a day. Furthermore, they could go anywhere and read any book at any time, free to follow the interests of the student as needed. This mentoring model of education would certainly help. Wll, that is what you'll have with home education.
Basically, we allow you as much freedom as you need to teach what you feel led and when you feel led. We let you choose the books from any resource or library. We do this because we believe that no one knows or loves your daughter more than you do. You know her strengths and weaknesses, when she's ready to proceed and when she needs further review. At home she'll never have to "fail" anything. She can always make an "A" (if you choose to show her grades) because you can always work toward mastery of the assignment and subject. And, finally, your love and patience can provide her with greater foundations for success. Nothing succeeds like success, the saying goes. It's so true. And home education provides ample opportunities for continued success.
We'll keep a file for her all the way through to graduation. She will receive a diploma one day. But more importantly she will receive the type of heart-felt attention at home that will give her confidence her whole life.
Frequently Asked Questions About Children with Special Needs
with Jean Lanman
Jean Munroe Lanman has over thirty years experience with "special needs students". She holds several teaching credentials and is a Learning Disability Specialist. Jean has an extensive background having taught grades K through college in public and private schools. She has instructed educators on the college level and continues to instruct teachers and parents in the most current methods of learning. Jean homeschooled one of her grandchildren and has been involved with homeschooling parents for many years. Abreast of all new technology she is in constant daily contact with students with special needs as Director of Lanman Educational Services offering Home School and Distance Learning opportunities using Expressways To Learning - Reading and Math Systems. Her approach includes meeting the needs of the student individually using a neurological technique, Auditory-Visual Impression Pairing, developed by Dr. Jack Hoes. Jean values the use of music, color and handwriting as important for the development of the learning pattern.
Question #1: Because my child is not functioning academically at grade level does this mean he or she has a learning disorder?
Not necessarily. There are a number of areas that need to be explored before placing a label on any child. There are physical concerns that take priority. The first step in making this evaluation is a complete physical examination. This may lead to further evaluation of the eyes and ears. Basic concerns may need to be addressed such as the need for glasses to correct a farsighted or nearsighted condition. A child with a history of ear infections may need professional care in this area. Physical problems of any kind will affect learning. Maturity is another consideration. All children do not mature at the same rate. This is not a learned activity and it cannot be taught or rushed. Some children are just not ready for the academic standard of their age level. Mental ability must enter in as a factor. Home environment is another consideration as well as identification of a physical handicap which has perhaps deprived the child of advancement in academics and presents an opportunity for remediation, the hidden handicap enters in at this point. We usually classify the child with a learning disability as being average or above ability but functioning below expected potential. The concern is what happens to the information that has entered the brain? How is the auditory information processed that has entered the brain through ears that can hear? How is the visual information processed that has entered the brain through eyes that check out with 20/20 vision? In the late 60's educators, physiologists and physicians became concerned with these questions. Many have studied the function of the brain and the learning pattern. We may still not have all the answers but we do know that in order to assist these children in learning we must get to the source of the problem. The problem must be met on a neurological level. Information enters the brain through the eyes or the ears and is processed through the brain to be released through speech or some kind of motor response. If there is some abnormality in this process it will reflect in what we refer to as a learning disorder and must be treated as such.
Question #2: My child has been diagnosed with ADHD. So what can I do to help him learn?
First of all the word "diagnosed" is very important. If a child has been checked by a specialist and given that diagnoses that is one thing. Unfortunately many parents and teachers confuse hyperactive with hyperkinetic, the latter term signifies a neurologically caused inability to sit still. Because a child displays distractibility, lack of attention or an impulsive behavior may not necessarily mean the child has ADHD. It is suggested that hyperactivity may reflect the judgment of the person working with the child. An active "all boy" may react very differently than his quiet older sister. A teacher or parent who requires order and quiet behavior may find the child's behavior difficult to tolerate while a teacher or parent who is more relaxed sees no concern. Children are different. In a firm, loving manner we set the rules and bend when necessary.
If the child is diagnosed by a specialist we need to flex when possible. Shorten the time the child needs to sit still. Change activities often. Let him stand to read if that is easier for him. He probably does have a difficult time not noticing everything around him and all at the same time. Find some method of learning that he enjoys and use it often. There is still a great deal of study and research being done in this field being done currently. Diet is very important. I am not a nutritionist but this would be one area I would certainly look at carefully. Children react to foods in different ways. Our modern "eat on the run" diet can be detrimental to the learning process.
Question #3: My child seems to be unable to correctly reproduce sounds, letters, or words. What kind of a disability is this?
This is referred to as an Auditory Processing problem. Many children who have passed the hearing test within a normal range cannot make sense out of what they hear. They may miss much of what is said because they cannot process it quickly enough. A few words or sounds may be "heard" but cannot be understood amid unintelligible sounds. They may "hear" speech sounds but they all sound alike. Some children may hear a vowel sound differently each time it is spoken. The child may hear a reverse sound. For examplem, when a "th" sound is given the child may hear an "f" sound. This is frustrating to the child but also to the parent. When a series of directions are given the child with an auditory processing problem may hear only one in the series. For example: "pick up your coat, take it to your room and put it on your bed." The child may be only able to process one direction, "go to your room". The parent should be aware of this concern and speak distinctly, patiently, and repeatedly. With severe cases, there are specialist that work with this problem.
A child may have a Visual Processing problem. Like the auditory, the child may test with 20/20 vision and yet not be able to correctly process letters or words that he sees. There are specialists that work with severe cases. Drills and activities can also be used at home.
There are curriculum programs that work from the neurological approach that are very helpful in strengthening both of these areas.
Question # 4: What relationship is there between music and learning especially with the "special needs" child?
Learning a verse or a poem has always been easier when put to music. Remember how you learned the alphabet? Music is a part of every human being. We match music to emotions. When we are discouraged music covers the hurt. When tired, music is restful. We select the music that fits the occasion. It has been said that music has the power to shape a child's intellect and life-long education. A recent article pointed out the fact that music encourages the learning process by engaging all of the senses that involve creative discovery and self-expression. A lot of research is being conducted in this field not only for its affect upon learning in general but especially with children with special needs. The correct selection of the music is important.
A homeschool mom recently mentioned to me that while singing from the hymn book in church it occurred to her that the words were divided into syllables that flowed with the music. She began using this approach with her son.
Question #5: It is impossible to read what my child has tried to write on paper. How important is handwriting to the learning process?
Over the many years that I have worked with children with special needs, I have observed the correlation of good fluent cursive handwriting with reading. In responding to the above question, I would like to use two quotes.
Dr. George H. Early, associate professor, Department of Special Education at Indiana State University, in an article from Academic Therapy, Vol. IX. No. 1 points out a number of advantages of cursive writing. He states that one advantage of cursive writing is that each word consists of one continuous line where all elements flow together (exception k, j, and t). Because of this continual flow of elements, the student more readily experiences the total form of a given word. He advocates teaching the art of good fluent cursive handwriting along with reading skills. Dr. Early mentions the rhythm in cursive writing. This promotes the automatic nature of the writing task. Dr. Early further states that cursive writing helps to prevent the development of early directional problems.
Dr. Samuel Blumenfelf, Education Philosopher is quoted, "Do not teach anything that has to be unlearned and do not let a child develop a bad habit. Instruct the child to do it right from the beginning. Knowledge acquired by the hand is transferred to the reading process. Thus, learning to write helps in learning to read."
In working with students I advocate the use of the gross motor skills gradually reducing to letters using fine movements of the hands and fingers. Making the letters in wide sweeps in the air then forming the letters in sand or finger paint. From this point gradually working to letters completely covering an 8 ½ by 11 sheet of paper. When ready for lined paper use primary lines first. Music with handwriting drills is valuable.
I would like to refer you to a booklet of information gathered by a homeschool mom, SIMPLY BETTER HANDWRITING by Pamela Vinson Aldrich.
Question # 6: What attitudes and mannerisms should I cultivate in my own life as a parent of a "special needs" child?
The first word that comes to my mind is "patience." However, I turned to some parents that struggle with this question on a daily basis. Here are some of the responses that they shared. An openness in dealing with the situation as a family affair. Understanding, help and support are essential from every member of the family. Many parents are prone to have feelings of guilt and their attitude is relayed to other members of the family. It is not the fault of anyone. You are a good mom and/or a good dad. Do not let guilt come between you and your child. Because "special needs" children require enormous amounts of time, brothers and sisters may feel neglected. Working out time with the other children in the family is an enormous task and every member of the family must be involved in helping to make this time available. Mom needs a little attention and time as well. Dads often find it difficult to set realistic goals especially if the child is a son. A "special needs" son especially needs the role model he finds in dad. Children are tuned into moods and feelings of those around them. Children with special needs are even more aware of this. Above all talk freely about the child's problem. The child needs to know the truth in language he or she is able to understand. They need to know that in spite of limitations they are loved and wanted.
As I work daily with parents and "special needs" children I marvel at the love, care and time these parents share. It is as if God selected them to meet the needs of these special children.
A: Interestingly, many parents find that their children do not have the same problems (or at least not as pronounced) at home. My opinion is that the stressful environment and the forced standardization of the traditional system is actually producing many modern learning "disabilities." Changing the environment to one of flexibility, love, and acceptance is priority number one. Second, realizing children are not all the same, and that some kids just need more time to master certain subjects is of utmost importance.
Many times we find that the child is very artistic. Unfortunately, it is a math and science world and these children are the first to not fit in. Their extreme creativity registers a deficit in things analytical. However, I'm convinced their certain style of genius is intentional: God made them this way. They are not disabled, they're unique and gifted and simply need room to discover it. Even widely excepted disabilities are often just brilliance in a one-size-fits-all world, as the thesis of The Gift of Dyslexia indicates. And the astronomical rise in ADD/ADHD is not a sudden epidemic in human history but, again, most the result of a society which refuses to recognize that children are ALL hyper -- it's the way God made them! In most cases they do not need medication, they need more interesting and stimulating ways to learn.
So, most of the time (again, recognizing there are some legitimate neurological abnormalities) I tell parents to do the following:
Remove the label. Tell your child he or she is no longer "disabled." That was a mistake on their part. Say, "You are perfectly normal and created by God just the way you are." Follow removing the label with plenty of affirmation.
Give them space and time. History is filled with genius minds who, were they growing up in today's schools, would be labeled as learning disabled. President Woodrow Wilson, for example, did not learn to read until age nine. Many children simply have the Edison Trait .
Make life and learning interesting again. Most children are either board or frustrated in today's schools. The ADD/ADHD epidemic is the result of a failure of traditional educational philosophies, not a sudden outbreak of hyperactivity in the last 20 years. Boys especially, need more room to explore, according to James Dobson's Raising Boys. Also see http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000713.html
Again, it is my opinion that the stressful environment and the forced standardization of the traditional system is actually producing many modern learning "disabilities." The best treatment?
Do not conform to the patterns of the world but be transformed by the renewing or your minds. - Romans 12:2
I believe God wants to transform our minds. But first, we must identify and avoid the patterns of the world.
May God bless this new generation of children who are finding their idenity and security in the Lord Jesus Christ. May they have the same "mind as Christ." (Philippians 2:5).
What Is Asperger Syndrome?
Co-author of THE OASIS GUIDE TO ASPERGER SYNDROME (Crown, 2001, Revised 2005)
Asperger Syndrome or (Asperger's Disorder) is a neurobiological disorder named for a Viennese physician, Hans Asperger, who in 1944 published a paper which described a pattern of behaviors in several young boys who had normal intelligence and language development, but who also exhibited autistic-like behaviors and marked deficiencies in social and communication skills. In spite of the publication of his paper in the 1940's, it wasn't until 1994 that Asperger Syndrome was added to the DSM IV and only in the past few years has AS been recognized by professionals and parents.
Individuals with AS can exhibit a variety of characteristics and the disorder can range from mild to severe. Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of "improper parenting".
By definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naiveté, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics and prosody. Vocabularies may be extraordinarily rich and some children sound like "little professors." However, persons with AS can be extremely literal and have difficulty using language in a social context.
At this time there is a great deal of debate as to exactly where AS fits. It is presently described as an autism spectrum disorder and Uta Frith, in her book AUTISM AND ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, described AS individuals as "having a dash of Autism". Some professionals feel that AS is the same as High Functioning Autism, while others feel that it is better described as a Nonverbal Learning Disability. AS shares many of the characteristics of PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not otherwise specified), HFA, and NLD and because it was virtually unknown until a few years ago, many individuals either received an incorrect diagnosis or remained undiagnosed. For example, it is not at all uncommon for a child who was initially diagnosed with ADD or ADHD be re-diagnosed with AS. In addition, some individuals who were originally diagnosed with HFA or PDD-NOS are now being given the AS diagnosis and many individuals have a dual diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism.
