NEW GIFTED PRIMARY ROLL OUT IN HALTON WON'T CREATE "TWO-TIERED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM"
Oakville, ON -
The Association for Bright Children of Ontario (ABC Ontario) commends the Halton District School Board (HDSB) for launching its new primary gifted placement.
At the Ontario Legislature on February 24, 2011, Sylvia Jones, MPP (Dufferin-Caledon), asked the Minister of Children and Youth Services if she was comfortable with allowing children with special needs to sit on a wait list for an assessment while gifted students are bumped to the front of the line. Jones stated, "By allowing this to happen the McGuinty Liberals are essentially creating a two-tiered educational system. Parents of special needs children within the Halton District School Board have a right to be concerned."
Under the Ontario Education Act, the Ministry of Education has defined 12 special needs groups. Intellectual giftedness is one of these identified groups and represents the second highest number of identified special needs students in the Province of Ontario.
According to ABC Ontario's President, Rosanna Del Grosso, "MPP Jones' assertion that 'gifted children' are displacing 'special needs' children is like saying that 'hockey players' are somehow bumping 'athletes' to the back of the line. Just as hockey players are obviously considered athletes, under the Education Act intellectually gifted children are defined as special needs' students."
ABC Ontario does not support any position or policy that puts parents of special needs children in competition with one another as this does not recognize the fundamental equality of all children and creates a hierarchy.

The real issue upon which the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education should place their focus is the extended backlog for children of all exceptionalities to obtain special needs assessments. Long wait times for necessary assessments are a systemic, province-wide problem that has been a concern for over a decade and one that penalizes all special needs children. ABC Ontario representatives at Special Education Advisory Committees have raised this problem time and time again through their local school boards.
"Issues concerning waiting periods for assessments have been ongoing for years and exist partly due to a lack of funding and available psychologists," said Del Grosso. "ABC Ontario hopes to work cooperatively with all special needs groups to advocate for reduced assessment wait times."
Through its mandate to support a full spectrum of learning opportunities for children from grades K to 12, ABC Ontario supports any early intervention offered to gifted students. ABC Ontario believes that initiatives such as the HDSB early primary placement will help address the long standing issues associated with gifted children, such as becoming disengaged from learning, reluctance to attend school, bullying, social isolation and mental issues like anxiety and depression. These problems are often reported when gifted children's needs are not properly addressed. The Halton District School Board has provided a gifted placement starting in Grade Five for many years. ABC Ontario believes that, without primary programming, many of our most capable young learners become disenchanted with learning, develop poor work habits and disruptive behaviour and begin a slow slide toward underachievement. ABC believes that problems of stress, underachievement and perfectionism frequently have their roots in an unchallenging early school experience.
It is commendable that any school board address this situation by offering a congregated primary gifted placement. ABC Ontario's recent report, A Look at Gifted Education Across Ontario , was based on contacts with 62 school boards across the Province. Five of the 62 boards confirmed that they had no programming specific to their gifted population at any point in their schooling. In addition, 35% of the reporting boards do not actively search for gifted students in their school population which under serves their special needs children.
The new HDSB primary gifted placement is therefore a bold step which offers significant opportunities in public education for special needs children. ABC Ontario applauds the HDSB for their ingenuity in creating this placement. ABC Ontario encourages all other school boards to follow the HDSB example.
