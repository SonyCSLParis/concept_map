History of Gifted Education (April 2002)
Where can I find articles about the history of gifted education in America?
One might suspect that gifted programs originated with Plato, who believed in an intellectual elite. In the early part of the 20th century, programs consisted primarily of acceleration when students needed it. Formal gifted programs can be traced back to 1918. In 1924, "The Education of the Gifted" was published by the University of Chicago Press. Guy Whipple, Chairman of the Committee of the Society that was responsible for this volume (the second in a series), provided a brief historical summary of the interest in and concern for the education of gifted individuals, observing that perhaps the first systematic approach to providing for "bright pupils" was developed by the Superintendent of Schools in St. Louis, Dr. William T. Harris. In his reports for 1868-69 and for 1871-73, Harris commented on the advantages of promoting pupils at short intervals, as short as five weeks in the lower grades and of accelerating gifted pupils through the grades. He noted that the plan provided gifted pupils with more challenging work and prevented them from acquiring habits of laziness. (Reference: EC115052. Passow, A. Harry (Ed) (1979).

An Anthology of Readings; see EC 303 213. Sponsoring Agency: Office of Educational Research and Improvement (ED), Washington, DC. EDRS Price - MF01/PC01 Plus Postage. Language: English Document Type: POSITION PAPER (120); REVIEW LITERATURE (070) Geographic Source: U.S.; Pennsylvania Journal Announcement: RIEDEC94 This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent," examines the relationship between American culture and efforts to educate gifted and talented students. The paper presents a historical overview of the cultural forces that have affected public policy, reviews the conflict between equality and intellect, and examines public education's attempts to educate gifted students. A lack of respect for achievement, effort, and merit in American schools and culture is noted. The ideas of de Toqueville, Locke, Binet, and Terman are cited to help explain the cultural forces influencing the education of gifted children. Three challenges for American policy makers are identified: (1) the need to make American culture supportive of efforts to develop the talents of young people; (2) the need to reform schools so that the needs of students who have "a curiosity and taste for achievement" are challenged and a less restrictive view of talent is adopted; and (3) the need to make able students "visible pace-setters within their schools" and to make schools more challenging for a broader spectrum of students.

EDRS Price - MF01/PC02 Plus Postage. Language: English Document Type: REVIEW LITERATURE (070); POSITION PAPER (120) Geographic Source: U.S.; North Carolina Journal Announcement: RIEDEC94 This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent," provides historical background on issues in gifted education, together with ideas and practices from the special educational strategies now in use for gifted students. The report focuses on the nature of superior intelligence, the general school adaptations for these children, current and unresolved issues in the education of the gifted, and specific policy issues in gifted education. Historical information describing how early cultures addressed or failed to address the needs of gifted children is offered. A major problem is seen to be the ambivalent feelings toward gifted children traditionally seen in the American society. Various definitions of giftedness are discussed, as are traits that characterize gifted children. Specific current issues addressed include the following: (1) educational reform; (2) creativity; (3) underserved populations (cultural differences, gifted girls, and gifted students with disabilities); (4) accountability; and (5) equity versus excellence. Future research is urged in such areas as understanding intellectual processes, assessing educational strategies for gifted students, and information processing. A table summarizes federal policy and legislation regarding the gifted since 1958.

ED315949 EC222099 The Gifted Movement--Forward or on a Treadmill. Leadership Accessing Monograph: Education of Gifted and Talented Youth. Tannenbaum, Abraham Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN. Gifted Education Resource Inst. 1988; 51p. Sponsoring Agency: Indiana State Dept. of Education, Indianapolis. Office of Gifted and Talented Education. EDRS Price - MF01/PC03 Plus Postage. Language: English Document Type: POSITION PAPER (120); HISTORICAL MATERIAL (060); SERIAL (022) Geographic Source: U.S.; Indiana Journal Announcement: RIEJUL90 Government: State The historical evolution of concern for education of gifted students is traced, along with the philosophical tides accompanying that evolution from the 1950s through the 1980s. It is argued that the public is alternatively supportive and antagonistic toward the gifted/talented. Periods of intense concern about their educational welfare are often followed with periods of apathy, antagonism, or lack of concern. The pre-Sputnik 1950s are contrasted with the post-Sputnik 1950s in terms of action on behalf of the gifted. The 1960s are viewed as a decade of turmoil during which large numbers of able students were encouraged to enroll in science programs early in the decade while attention turned to other pressures later, such as school integration, compensatory education, and Vietnam and the disenchantment of youth. The 1970s then saw renewed attention to the gifted, due to federal legislation targeting gifted students and the issuing of the Marland report which documented the deteriorated condition of gifted programs. The 1980s were marked by well-established programs for the gifted/talented in many American schools, educational provisions for underprivileged minorities, and less reliance upon Intelligence Quotients as measures of giftedness. The monograph closes with a "bill of rights" for the gifted.
