This committee addresses the needs of diverse learners in the school population by fostering communication and awareness of special education between the district, school, parents, and children. Exceptional children include the gifted and talented, as well as students with mental retardation; physically disabilities; chronic illnesses; visual disabilities; hearing disabilities; speech disabilities; social and emotional disabilities; learning disabilities; and in some instances, disadvantaged and deprived students. Each local unit is strongly encouraged to have this committee. This committee recognizes and promotes each child's abilities rather than disabilities. It is not designed to be a sounding board, but is organized to help assist in the education of all children.
Special Services Programs: Provide current information about support groups and meetings to families, assist with and promote awareness of legislative issues relating to special education, conduct educational workshops for parents about services and strategies related to special services, raise awareness among all students, parents, and staff about the needs, talents and uniqueness of all children, encourage students, parents and community members to mentor children, and work within the community to encourage businesses to provide employment opportunities for children receiving special services.
National PTA Launches Special Education ListServ
Realizing that PTA members with children with disabilities are often geographically dispersed and, in some cases, isolated from other parents facing similar issues, National PTA has created a listserv to facilitate the sharing of information and resources. The listserv also will provide National PTA a public forum to keep PTA members informed on issues affecting students with disabilities and will help National PTA staff effectively respond to issues facing this segment of our membership. This listserv is the most recent development in local and National PTA efforts to provide support to families of children with disabilities. To join the listserv, go to www.pta.org/specialed and fill out the required fields. If you have any questions regarding this listserv, contact Melina Wright, National PTA's federal lobbyist on disability issues, at mwright@pta.org , or Shahenaz Chhipa, the listserv administrator, at schhipa@pta.org .

The Parent Mentor Partnership is now celebrating its fifth anniversary of working together to increase parental involvement in special education. The partnership, which started as a small group of parents and administrators, now collaborates with more than 60 local school systems and over 140,000 families raising children with learning and/or physical challenges.
Created and partially-funded by the Georgia Department of Education's Division for Exceptional Students, the 62 Parent Mentors are moms and dads hired by local school systems to work with special education directors, parents, school teams, teachers and the community. Their goal is to build a bridge of communication between home and school. Together, they collaborate to increase parent involvement in solving concerns and gaining ground on targeted goals to improve all children's achievement. The Partnership, which meets 2-3 times a year statewide and four times a year regionally, is locally driven, which makes each program unique to meet the needs of the individual area.
Mentors build connections for families in the community, concentrate on transition needs of high school students and young children, lead task forces, organize training sessions, collaborate with teachers and increase parent involvement activities in schools. Most importantly, the mentors listen to both parents and educators and use their unique knowledge of both worlds to solve communication issues.
Who are these parents?   Parent Mentors come from many backgrounds. Some live in the north Georgia mountains, while others live on the Georgia coast. They come from the cities, the suburbs and the rural areas of our state. The mentors' resumes include experience from corporate America to the family farm. One mentor served as a Major in the Army, while another served as a juvenile judge. Still other mentors taught school and ran stores, while others stayed home with their children.
While their personal histories varied, they shared many of the same challenges, frustrations and joys in navigating the education system while raising a child with a disability. Parent Mentors' accountability is measured in part on the local district's comprehensive improvement plan. Collecting quantitative data is helpful in explaining mentor activities but does not tell the complete story of improved student performance. This year Parent Mentors are stepping into the world of cumulative data by writing anecdotal stories to go along with some of the data each district is striving to improve.
In this effort to increase parent involvement, Parent Mentors also team with other Georgia DOE divisions, particularly the parent initiatives in the Title I division. They also look for opportunities to combine efforts with local parent and community groups. The Partnership collaborates with Parent to Parent of Georgia, a statewide nonprofit team with a vast database. They act as a first stop for family information on special education services and resources.
The Parent Mentors lead activities in line with the Parent Teacher Student Association's National Standards of Parent Involvement which are evidenced-based, family involvement indicators. The 17 Georgia Learning Resource Systems also play an important role in supporting the training of the mentors as do the Division for Exceptional Students' district liaisons. In addition, a parent of a child with a disability leads the parent mentor effort at the GaDOE and is partnered with a staff education consultant.
Georgia Parent Mentor Partnership is modeled after a similar program in Ohio and began in five county districts: Catoosa, DeKalb, Fayette, Fulton and Grady. Most parent mentors today work 20 hours a week during the school year while some districts ask parent mentors to work fulltime and year-round.
