Parents are one of the greatest influences on their children and their first and best teachers. Young children learn to talk, walk, and interact by watching their parents. As children grow up, they look to their parents to provide guidance, information, nurturing, and expectations. Teens say their parents are more influential in their decisions than friends, teachers, coaches, and the news media.
The topics on the left reflect common issues and safety concerns that children face as they grow up. Follow the links for information on each topic and how parents can act to keep their children safe, to give them skills to protect themselves and resist negative peer pressure, and to engage them in positive activities. Also, read NCPC brochures and tip sheets for advice that you can print out and take with you and share with others.
