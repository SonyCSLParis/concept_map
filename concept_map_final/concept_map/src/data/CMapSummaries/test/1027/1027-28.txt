NEW! Crary's Guidance in Several New Books
"Realistic," "Practical,"and "Respectful" are three of the words that people use to describe the parenting books Elizabeth Crary has been creating since 1979. Another important description: "Choices."
If you're looking for a parenting approach you can tailor to your family, your needs, your values, consider Crary's classic Without Spanking or Spoiling -or read the descriptions of these new publications:
Detailed how-to's of an approach that Crary has been teaching for more than 20 years, STAR Parenting Tales and Tools is praised by both professionals and parents:
"If I had only one book to buy for parenting strategies, this is it!" exclaimed Karen Zimmerman,an early childhood content coach in St. Paul MN.
"Learning to think about a dilemma from all angles, taking into account one's family values, child development and temperament are only a few of the important factors covered," pointed out Barbara LeBlanc of the Parenting Center at Children's Hospital, New Orleans.
"We are reminded that there is no single right way to parent and there are no short cuts to good parenting. Crary also points out that even good ideas can be ineffective," added Glen Palm, parent educator and professor of child and family studies at St. Cloud (MN) State University.
Parents agree:
"I'm a confident parent today because of the practical tools STAR Parenting has given me."
" STAR Parenting made me realize that I've been focusing on negative behaviors and not the positive. Now I understand how I can change that."
" STAR Parenting has taught me that if I try something and it doesn't work, I'm not a bad parent, I just need to try something else."
In this concise, easy-to-read guide, Crary describes four levels of support typical of parents and caregivers. She tells us how we who care for children can shift from the nurturer role so important in early years to teacher, coach and finally to consultant. Packed with how-to's, examples, and scenarios we can identify with, this is ideal whether you're at the beginning of the parenting journey or anticipating the empty nest.
If you think having kids do chores is only important because adults in the home need help, Crary has news for you. Chores are important because of how they prepare children for adulthood: helping with household tasks beginning in the preschool years is the single best predictor of success in young adulthood, research shows.
Available online and in print format.
Protecting Kids from Predators
How can adults skip the scare tactics when they talk to kids about molesters? In Out of Harm's Way , Sandy K. Wurtele gives us examples of what to say, and suggests "what if" conversations to have with children.
We're delighted to announce that the California Department of Education, one of the largest markets for books, has approved The Way I Act and its teacher guide for classroom use.
Librarians love it, too.
"With its range and clear-cut examples, this book will be a useful addition to character-education curricula," writes School Library Journal about the picture book that was written by Steve Metzger and illustrated by Janan Cain as a companion to Cain's best-selling The Way I Feel .
An important publication for educators and librarians, the journal also praises The Way I Act for aiming "to help children understand behaviors and choices . . . Each verse gives specific examples. . ."
Initial response has also been enthusiastic from the parents and professionals who deal with autism, a group that has made extensive use of The Way I Feel .
Like The Way I Feel , The Way I Act uses examples young children can identify with: using a magnifying glass, doing homework, helping friends, getting on the school bus alone, and going down the giant water slide. Quirky characters that appeal to both boys and girls bounce, swing and high-five each other through the pages.
One of several books on emotional literacy published by Parenting Press, The Way I Feel presents emotions as a normal part of life. The characters discuss feelings without blaming anyone for causing anger or boredom. Unlike in many other similar books, characters are not "rescued" from their emotions by others.
With more than 1.6 million copies in print in English, Spanish, French, Chinese and Greek, The Way I Feel is Parenting Press's most popular book ever. We're sure you'll agree that The Way I Act is just as much fun!

QWIK Books Provide Concise Information 24/7
Parenting Press's expanding line of QWIK Books offer concise advice about SIDS, sleep, ADHD, chores and so many other important topics, in books you can access from our web site whenever you need them. Most are also available in traditional printed format. Our newest titles:
What is ADHD? What medications are commonly prescribed? How do they work? These are a few of the many questions answered by Peter Levine, M.D., and Helen F. Neville, B.S., R.N., in this concise guide. Based on decades of experience, they explain how medications differ, what risks there are, and if you can expect a child to outgrow ADHD.
If you've ever wondered what preschoolers are capable of doing around the house, or why to insist that your tweens finish their chores, you'll want this guide by Elizabeth Crary. It suggests appropriate tasks by age, explains how to introduce chores, and provides tips on overcoming resistance. Even more important, it cites research that documents the importance of doing chores in growing up to be responsible and successful.
Two physicians committed to SIDS research, Rachel Y. Moon and Fern R. Hauck, walk prospective parents, parents of infants and caregivers through an introduction to SIDS risk factors. They describe which babies are most vulnerable to SIDS, and point out what traditional baby care practices (bumpers and quilts in cribs, for example, and the family bed) are now discouraged because of the risks to babies.
A registered nurse who has spent more than 30 years as a pediatric advice nurse and parent educator, Helen F. Neville has fielded more questions about sleep in her career than any other topic. That's why her concise 32-page book is packed with strategies that have been well-tested. She'll help you figure out what the problem is, and how you might solve it.
