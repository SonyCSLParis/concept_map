The Internet is full of wonderful opportunities for kids and teens to learn, socialize, and develop technical skills, but there are also dangers that come with it. We recommend you start with these complimentary resources to learn more:
Learn About the Dangers: The 3 C's
When thinking about Internet dangers, remember the " 3 C's ": (1) inappropriate content , (2) inappropriate communications , and (3) inappropriate customs.
Inappropriate Content
Inappropriate content includes everything from pornography to profanity, from brutality to bulimia. Parents need to be able to control the content that comes into their home and keep the lines of communication open with their children about what they have seen and heard.
Inappropriate Communication
The Internet is a two-way street. Kids are not only exposed to content, they create it. Kids don't just partake, they promote. The Internet is where kids and teens step out and socialize. While this can have great benefits, it is important for parents to know the dangers associated with it. Kids can give away too much or embarrassing information about themselves or others. Kids can be bullied by others. Kids can even interact with predators and others who mean to do them harm.
Inappropriate Customs
Red letter dangers are easy to spot. But even when a child isn't exposed to damaging content or communications, they can form unhealthy Internet habits. Teens can spend too much time online or become obsessed with their online image. This not only causes tensions at home, but also results in less time spent with family and other important activities.
Learn About the Solutions
A recent survey says over two-thirds of kids purposefully cover their tracks to make sure their parents won't find out what they do online. John Mangelaars of Microsoft says, "It is incredibly important parents stay actively involved, talking regularly with their kids and using the parental technology tools that are available to them."
