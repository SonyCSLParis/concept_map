A newly released study of the possible links between a mother's condition during pregnancy and the chance her baby will suffer a developmental disorder comes to a provocative conclusion: obese moms may have a greater chance of delivering a baby with autism.
The population-based study conducted between January 2003 and June 2010 found that women who were obese during pregnancy were approximately 67 per cent more likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder.
Researchers studied approximately 1,000 California children between the ages of two and five, more than two-thirds of whom had been diagnosed with autism or developmental delays.
Compared with the average woman who has a 1 in 88 chance of having a child with autism, factoring in obesity increases those odds to 1 in 53, the study's authors found.
The research stops short of proving a causal link between obesity and autism, but its authors note the growing prevalence of obesity in the American population means the mere possibility should be cause for concern.
The mothers' conditions during pregnancy were self-reported, with medical records confirming the claims of more than half the women. There was no information on the mothers' blood tests during pregnancy, nor their diets or other habits in those months.
The researchers say there were no other factors, however -- such as discrepancies in education, race, ethnicity or health insurance -- that could influence the results.
The study, which was partially funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was published Monday on the website of the journal Pediatrics .
"If you are planning a pregnancy you might want to think about losing weight, getting your exercise routine in order and controlling your blood sugar," said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an autism researcher at the University of California.
Researcher Tom Frazier of the Cleveland Clinic's Center on Autism said the latest study should be seen as a warning about the general risks of unhealthy pregnancies.
"For a mother who is pregnant, she is going to pay very careful attention to their blood pressure...and to whether or not they're overweight and to a make sure that any diabetes is under control," he told CTV News.
A recent report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimated that one in 88 American eight-year-olds have autism -- the disorder often characterized by repetitive behaviours and difficulties in social interaction as well as verbal and non-verbal communication. That was up from about one in 110 back in 2006, and one in 150 in 2002.
In Canada, a report from the National Epidemiologic Database for the Study of Autism noted that autism diagnoses were up in Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and southeastern Ontario too, with increases since 2003 ranging from 39 to 204 per cent, depending on the region and age group.
Those numbers, which some experts note may be rising due to increased awareness and diagnostic improvements, have been growing alongside obesity rates.
In the U.S., more than one-third of pregnancy-age women are obese. According to the World Health Organization, someone whose Body Mass Index (weight(kg)/height(m)2) is greater than or equal to 30 is considered obese. While the formula does not apply to pregnant women, their recommended weight gain during pregnancy is also based on BMI.
Based on its figures from 2008, the WHO estimated there were 1.5 billion overweight adults worldwide, including nearly 300 million obese women.
Other studies have linked obesity during pregnancy with increased risks of stillbirths, preterm births and birth defects.
Scientists trying to pin down the cause of autism have previously examined genetics as well as the effects of illness and use of medication during pregnancy. Antiobiotics have also come under fire, due to the belief their over-use could alter bacteria found in human digestive systems. Other environmental factors have even been scrutinized, including the use of certain chemicals and pesticides.
Suzanne Lanthier, who has an autistic son, said she welcomes any new knowledge about a condition that affects about 190,000 Canadians.
"My son is now 13 and when he was first diagnosed, we could fill the amount of research that was going on onto a couple of pages," she said.

The study encompassed 1004 cases. The statistical likelihood of ASD was 67% higher in cases were the mother was obese (35lbs or more overweight). That's a good sized study, and the difference is not anomalous. It has already been demonstrated that second children born withing 36 months of a first child (when mothers are less likely to have reduced their weight from their first pregnancy) were more than 505 more likely to be autistic (a study of 600,000 siblings). Also later first pregnancies (over 35 ) has a 300% increased risk. Obesity and age are closely connected. Clearly maternal obesity and Autism are in some way connected - but also clearly not the only causal factor. Let scientists do their work please and stop with the irrational finger pointing.
I don't believe it said
I know all to many thin and healthy women who have autistic children. It just doesn't add up. I think it also offers average/thin women false hope that their child may not be autistic when in fact they are just as likely. If weight had something to do with it why do thin women have autistic children too? On the other hand it could be something in food we eat. If obese women eat more of this food, that could be a cause. So many chemicals, hormone fed animals we come in contact with, anything could be a possibility.

Any autism connection into 'sneezing' during pregnancy ... with sarcasm re: to study findings.
deb said
@ realist, I actually know a lot of women with autistic children and very few of them are obese, does anyone have any idea how hurtful these "might" studies can be? Do you really think that as a parent of an autistic child I haven't thought of all the things I may or may not have done wrong? And beaten myself up appropriately by the way. They aren't sure of much when it comes to autism except that early intervention is crucial.
shawbrooke said
The study authors checked for other demographic links, so the finding may be all too real. A ,link would explain why rates of autism and obesity rose at the same time.This is serious.
Sebastien said
"I feel sorry for all of you that do not understand science. It is sad that our education system is letting us down by not teaching us to understand science. The study didn't say that fit mothers could not have children with autism, but that fat mothers were more likely to have children with autism." -artTHIS.
Ivan said
Sounds like a lot of people don't like this conclusion. If you are obese, you are not healthy. Why is it so surprising that an unhealthy woman would have an unhealthy child.
Joan said
It used to be the mother's fault because she was cold and uncaring, now it's her fault because she's fat! Cases of autism have risen 600 percent in industrialized countries. This is very likely to do with our overuse of antibiotics. If it was due to obesity the women in Mauritania would have more autistic children and this is not the case.
Kathy said
Oh baloney, last I heard they said their was a genetic link in some cases. This is just another guilt trip for mothers who are struggling to raise a child with autism. I don't like these off the cuff "research studies". The bottom line is that they don't really know and it's strictly guess work.
RooferMom said
My 5yo son with Autisim was carried by a gestational surrogate..She was in perfect health including her weight. What a load of BS this is
Dianne said
I have a 16 year old daughter with autism and I was neither overweight and certainly not obese. It's true that weight may have contributing factors for health and body conditions, but this sounds like a bit of a stretch in terms of it could be coincidental. Obesity has been and will continue to be a problematic epidemic, however, it doesn't sound like this study is conclusive to the autism epidemic.
Pat in Mississauga said
Let's put the money spent on these useless studies on some serious research and support for autistic families. This was not a scientific, controlled study. Good heavens it was self reporting and only 50% of the mothers reports were backed up by medical records. It is irresponsible to report this study. that said, try to lose the weight before pregnancy ladies. You will feel better and it may be better for your baby. I would like to see more responsible reporting of these studies instead of just an attempt to grab headlines. Who paid for the study? What was their interest? Did they have an agenda? Who were the researchers? What are their credentials? How much was spent on the study?
mark said
Well at least people will stop blaming vaccines...and parents will stop coming into my clinic refusing to immunize their children because Jenny McCarthy said so. Where did she go to medical school?
Karen said
My sister is obese. She has three beautiful, highly intellent, non-autistic children.
My sister-in-law, who is considered to be a healthy weight, has a son who is extremely autistic.
So, in my opinion, studies like this are a gross waste of money. Instead, we all need to look at our environment, the chemicals and "crap" that is in our food and the day-to-day stress of living is today's world ....!!!!!
Lauren said
This is nonsense.......I have two children, both with autism.....and maybe for not all cases, but for my two children their autism is hereditary......it is through their father's side of the family which has nothing to do with obesity during pregnancy(which I was not anywhere near during pregnancy), is has nothing to do with vaccines, or anything else. They were born with it, it is genetic, case closed!
freerun said
Ok, most of the people who commented here have no clue what 'scientific research' or 'statistics' actually mean! They have no clue on the meaning of words like 'cause' and 'correlate'! Overall, people have such poor reading comprehension, it's amazing they even bother posting their thoughts on the subject matter! Ridiculous...
Parent of a teen with autism said
Christine: Wkaefield was proven to have falsified his "study" in support of a lawsuit agianst a vaccine manufacturer. His irresponsible and illegal act spawned a generation of conspiracy theorists and children who were harmed by NOT being vaccinated against preventable deseases. Wakefield lost his medical license in Europe and is only recognised as a doctor in Florida now, he is also being sued by a great many parents of children with autism for misleading everyone with his false claims. PLUS he has criminal charges waiting against him should he ever return to the UK. Do you need any more?
BJ said
This scientific research is crap. I'm not totally against it,mind you. But they are pinning on obese women. During my prgnancy, I was at normal weight through out. I speak for all women here. One: I was not taking enough vit.for my system,and increased during my pregnancy,which is a no no.I found out later. Two: The stress level during my second child who had problems,changed his brain patterns here.This was a key factor here. Three: Also during my pregnancy my blood sugar went wacky because of stress,which cause his blood type to be different from us two parents he is type 0.
My child had problems during the first four years of his life, I dealt with it,and now he is a professor at a college. So where do they get off telling me it's obese that cause this. No it's stress stress stress, and changing things mid-stream of your pregnancy.The way you eat,what you take such as Vit, and medication, and your daily routine has a lot that effects your child in side you. So you scince people go back to the drawing board.

True science is not based on statistics and coincidence. The only to find true results is in a controlled enviroment. Obviously if obesity is on the rise than there will be more of any given demographic that could be obese and that alone does not determinea cause for anything.
PLEASE READ THIS! said
Obesity is NOT a cause, it is a symptom that something else is wrong. Everyone must watch the documentary "Fat Head" (it's on Netflix, and is all about a guy who LOSES weight and IMPROVES his overall health while chowing down on fast food for a month, but unlike Spurlock backs up his claim with scientific evidence rather than conjecture), not only is it hilarious but I believe it is the truth!

GDC said
I also read an article just last week about fathers whom are 35 years and up concieving at and having more chances of having children with autism...Instead of reporting on the MAYBE's perhaps it would be more informatinve knowing for sure if this was the case. The Maybe's makes people, including myself, worried and stress that perhaps my child will have these symptoms. I want to know for certain, not just a slight possibility.

"Man, it seems like the public has a lot of opinions on scientific research. How is it that our state of education is so poor? Why do people think their opinions matter on issues of science so much? I think we're all confusing politics - which is just about opinion - with science. Dissapointed Canadian :("I dont know if you're a scientist yourself and feel attacked by the comments... who knows. However I'm afraid that even from an educated point of view these statistics are as much science as the opinions of people on this board. Furthermore, the fact that it seems to suppoet a policy aimed against obese people should really make everyone take notice not of the science, but of the bias.

Can't you just see it? Big pharma will release a drug for this one! It will simply reduce your appetite, thereby claiming may reduce the frequency of austic births.
Terry said
Have you heard of this new study, apparently stupidity is linked to academic achievement, the study suggests that the higher the education the dumber the person is ... and then there is the one concerning big nose syndrome, it suggests that the testosterone levels lead to bigger noses ... I guess that all these idiots need to keep their noses out of other people's business and focus on actual science...

True or not, good advice either way!
Sigh said
what a bunch of BS. with the rate of people and women overweight today you could correlate the rotation of the moon on it!I had a text book pregnancy and started at my ideal weight. My daughters autism is not because i was overweight or vaccinated her. Simple fact is that we will probably never understand the cause, what we should be doing is putting all the money going to these ridiculous studies to the lifetime support of kids and adults with all variations of autism.
CM said
It should be easy to compare Autism stats in Canada to other countries, ranking for obesity. Clearly, more information is needed here.
Tricia said
Tina, reread what I wrote. I quite clearly said correlation with regard to obesity. Many blame the MMR vaccine as the CAUSE of autism. And, before you slam me, I raise a child that is diagnosed as RAD. It is virtually identical to Autism, the difference is the history of significant trauma or abuse. My stepson requires a full time aide for severe behavioral issues - he misses facial cues, he misses person boundaries, he rages, he behaves inappropriatly, etc. I have a cousin with Aspergers and I have friend's with Autistic children. Why, do we as a society, continually lay the blame on others? Obesity is a problem, as difficult as it is to change, that can be reversed. If obesity is a major cause, then why are we not doing everything we can to prevent the problems we are laying on the next generation?
verna weeks said
I cannot believe that people who do this reseach actually get paid for this crap. They could better spend their time wasting ur money and commit themselves to regular health care, like nursing or lab technology. There must be a shortage somewhere. This is BS! a total waste of time and money.
tina said
they said CORRELATION not CAUSATION!Read before you criticize people, or buy yourself a dictionary
Tricia said
We have a problem with obesity. We have changed our diets dramatically in the last thirty years. We consume processed, genetically modified and chemical laden food that we know is unhealthy for us, but it is fast and easy. As a society, we have put convenience ahead of health. We have children that have Type 2 Diabetes, that often has heart, renal or ocular damage prior to its onset! This study shows us data that should have us rethinking our food/lifestyle choices. The data shows a correlation between obesity and a significant increase in the rates of autism. It, also, shows about a 1 in 35 rate that still happens in the absence of obesity. Yet, many will blame vaccines as the causation, in the lack of scientific proof. It is easier to blame someone else other than ourselves. We demand to know WHY did this happen to my child, the answer we just got demands us to take some accountability.
TER said
Is there still obese people out there? They have to look at all the crap in the food and air that never was around 50 or more years ago, there is chemicals everywhere and companies thnk that,s normal.
Janine said
I can think of several slim, non-diabetic women who gave birth to children with ASD, and several obese women who didn't.Doctors ought to keep unproven hypotheses in the lab and refrain from laying blame. There's enough of it out there already.
Katie said
I'm like most other people posting on this topic. I don't buy this garbage study. Its junk science. I know plenty of people with autistic children and the mothers were and are not overweight. It makes me angry that mothers coping with this terrible condition are being made to feel guilty about weight. The other thing that bothers me is that a bunch of researchers were paid good money to come out with this garbage.
AlbertaMom said
What an insult! Since I have Chrones Disease and weighed only 100 pounds when I became pregnant with my son who is on the spectrum...either I'm too fat by their standard, or I'm just an anomaly that wasn't utilized in their study. What ever happened to the good old scientific days where the hypothesis got thrown out the window because it was not 100% accurate?

This is bull. Why do one of my twin grandsons have autism and the other dosn't?
Frustrated Mom said
Another wonderful study to blame parents. It's hard enough to have a child with Autism but to now have to deal with all the scowls and looks that mothers will have to deal with. To sit there and talk to someone about your Autistic child and all the mother will be sitting there thinking "I know they are blaming me because I am overweight". Just another added problem to a mother who has to deal with this. Honestly cancer would be easier to deal with because at least there is hope with chemotherapy and medications. With Autism there is no hope. Everyday gets worse and that is the honest truth. Well, unless you are Jenny McCarthy and can cure Autism.

ok i was actually a little under weight and my son was on time but weighed 5lbs so ya son having autism isnt linked to obesity and we also kept him from getting the 1year and 18month shots just in case and again my son has autism.

Kathleen said
I think its more plausible that it has more to do with some of the toxic food consumed during the pregancy by those that are overweight, i.e. foods containing aspartame, etc. rather than the obesity itself. People have been obese for hundreds of years and autism wasn't reported as an issue before (they used to have other names for it); however given all of the abnormal foods we have presently (created foods that are substances are bodies were never borne to ingest), its far easier to accept the fact that one or more of those created foods is causing havock with our bodies than mere obesity itself.
Perry said
This is statistical nonsense and irresponsible journalism.
Alan Schroeder said
Is it possible that the real culprit here may be high blood sugar levels during pregnancy.And what about the condition of the male sperm? has any research been done related to sperm damage due to the age of the provider, drug use, or other factors, such as high blood sugar levels on the part of the father.We know sugar consumption has gone through the roof in North America. Could the cause be as simple as a link to sugar consumption?
realist said
@ Deb & Dan: why is it every time there is a study about anything there must be people like you who have to comment that just because the results of the study don't reflect YOUR personal situation, it must be total "hogwash"? All it says is that there could be a connection. That doesn't mean it's the reason 100% OF THE TIME...
Christine C. said
This is soooo wrong. My mother was so skinny when she was pregnant with my autistic brother, people were surprised to learn she was even with child. I was much heavier when I was pregnant with my daughter than with my son and he's the one with severe ASD. Just great... another reason to make parents of autistic children feel like they are the ones who contributed to it..... nothing like planting a seed for all those who know nothing at all about the syndrome to start pointing fingers and jumping to conclusions... awesome!!!

When the term Autism was first coined they blamed the cold "refrigerator" mothers, who were not loving and caring enough. It seems that someone just can't let go of that
christine said
Personally I couldn't prove or disprove the comment on autism and vaccins. Maybe the person who made that comment might be kind enough to list his expertise in the matter. As for the article, I'm always amazed how quickly scientist seem to jump to conclusions about one or another cause for ailments, namely in this case, autism. The supposed link to vaccins seems just as clear as this new link that unfortunately reeks of quick to judge and bias statistics.Exactly why are we supposed to believe this statistic when even the scientists who proclaimed it admit that they really have little real data other than the weight of the women and, on top of that, have chosen to study a group mainly composed of autistic children when the reality is that the proportion in the real world is infinitely smaller.... Would that be yet another attempt to scare people straight by e authorities hellbent on making everyone act the way they think is best?? I believe in being as healthy as one can be, but in recent years I have become seriously concerned with the government's intrusion in our free will.
Lynn said
I agree with both the comments below; however, if this report is that final boost for anyone who is obese to make the decision and do the work to lose weight and become healthy, I'm glad it was reported anyways.
Deb said
Okay that's a load of crap--the best shape I was in pregnancy wise was the child who has autism I have two other children who had a bigger birth weight and which I gained more weight with--they are not autistic in any way. btw my autistic child was 8lbs 6oz so he wasn't a light weight either. I am 5' 6" 135 lbs weight is not a factor--please do some real science.
Dan Jarvis said
This is hogwash. My wife was a skinny as a rail before and during the pregnancy of our second son who is living with Moderate Asperger Syndrome.
Karen said
What a crock of hooey. I hate speculative reserarch where inferential relationships are built as if they are based in fact and then backed up with speculative reasons they are true. If there was a definitive link between obesity and autism there would be even more autism in North America and the US rate would be astronomical. As usual it is blame the mother without real facts.
ian said
The problem with these studies is that they don't complete them before releasing possible theories to the public. So just like the whole issue over autism and vaccines, which was debunked in the end, this new study may end up being just as useless.
Parent of teen with autism said
Autism is genetic. While there are many factors that are not understood, it is NOT caused by gluten, vaccines, "refridgerator mothers", or mom's weight during pregnancy. When will these fools figure out that correlation is not causation.
I think taking and displaying such photograph was a wrong act. What is photographer trying to prove by taking such picture? There could be millions of other things about that culture that photographer could have exhibited something positive or something constructive and more sensible.
