The Government is concerned about the levels of obesity in this country. The latest Health Survey for England (HSE) data shows us that nearly 1 in 4 adults, and over 1 in 10 children aged 2-10, are obese.
In 2007, the Government-commissioned Foresight report predicted that if no action was taken, 60% of men, 50% of women and 25% of children would be obese by 2050.
Obesity can have a severe impact on people's health, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and heart and liver disease.
There is also a significant burden on the NHS - direct costs caused by obesity are estimated to be Â£4.2 billion per year and forecast to more than double by 2050 if we carry on as we are.
Reducing obesity is a priority for the Government. We want people to know that they can change their lifestyle and make a difference to their health.
The Government will provide clear, consistent messages on why people should change their lifestyle, how to do so, and put in place ways to make this easier. We will also work in partnership with local government, charities and business to reduce obesity.
The White Paper Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our Strategy for Public Health in England, sets out how the Government plans to improve public health. The Department of Health will publish a follow-on document setting out how obesity will be tackled in the new public health and NHS systems, along with the role that all partners can play.
Change4Life is England's first ever national social marketing campaign to promote heathly weight. It aims to prevent people from becoming overweight by encouraging them to eat well, move more and live longer.
Change4Life convenience stores
The convenience stores programme is a partnership between the Department of Health and the Association of Convenience Stores to increase the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in areas that might otherwise have limited access to them.
Since the programme began in November 2008, 227 stores throughout England have joined up and are selling fresh fruit and vegetables using Change4Life branding. Evaluation of the stores taking part in the programme show an increase in sales of fruit and vegetables of up to 50% in some stores.
From April 2011, the Association of Convenience Stores will continue to expand the programme throughout the country and, as part of the Responsibility Deal, has pledged to roll-out in a further 1000 stores.
National Child Measurement Programme
The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) is an annual programme to measure the height and weight of all children in Reception and Year 6. The information is used to help the NHS and local authorities plan and provide better health services for children.
Most areas are now sharing each child's individual results with parents, along with Change4Life tips and an invitation to parents to contact their local NHS if they want to discuss the results or get further advice. Sharing a child's results with the parents gives them the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their child's health.
In additon to this, we are encouraging PCTs to invite parents and carers of children identified as underweight, overweight or obese to take up an offer of advice or support.
Advertising and marketing of food to children
The advertising and marketing of food to children can influence children's food habits. The Government has worked with Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to ensure healthier foods are promoted to children on TV and in non-broadcast media. The advertising industry self-regulates in non-broadcast media and has put in place controls for the advertising of food to children.
For TV advertising, Ofcom uses the nutrient profiling (NP) model as a tool to differentiate foods on the basis of their nutritional composition and restricts TV advertising of food and drink to children where products are high in fat, salt and sugar.
The National Heart Forum (NHF) was commissioned by the Department to undertake an analysis of the regulatory and voluntary landscape concerning the marketing and promotion of food and drink to children.
Obesity Learning Centre
The OLC is for those who work to reduce obesity. It provides an opportunity to share best practice, discuss issues with others working in this area, access resources and to keep up to date with the latest developments.
Childhood Obesity National Support Team
The Childhood Obesity National Support Team (CONST), was established in 2007 to assist local areas in improving the quality and impact of healthy weight delivery systems and interventions.
CONST has supported local areas in addressing unhealthy behaviours that lead to excess weight gain during pregnancy, in children and uyoung people, and in their families. Through 44 visits and follow-up support, the CONST has helped to steer local areas towards actions that improve the quality and interventions and to create environments that support individuals and families to lead healthier lives.
The CONST Strategic High Impact Changes document published in April 2011, captures this learning and evidence from these visits and translates it into suggested action for addressing obesity in local areas.
The National Obesity Observatory
The National Obesity Observatory (NOO) provides a single point of contact for wide-ranging, authoritative data and evidence on overweight, obesity and their causes. Work includes providing analysis of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), and developing evaluation tools to promote practice-based evidence.
