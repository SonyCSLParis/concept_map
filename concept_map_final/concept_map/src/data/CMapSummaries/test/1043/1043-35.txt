Earlier this week we told you about a recent report from the Annie E Casey Foundation highlighting the importance of reading, especially in the early years of life.  Though reading success if often seen as the "job" of the education system, parents should remember that they are their child's first and most important educator.
What can Parents do to help their child succeed?
While there is a place for school and teachers, parents should never forget that they are the primary caregivers for their children at all ages- their first and most important teacher. There are many things that a parent can do to help their child succeed in reading and also thus in other areas of school.
Read to your Child- this can never be overemphasized It is NEVER too early to begin reading to your children. Children of all ages can benefit from being read to, and this can help instill a love of reading in your child.
Help you child be ready to enter school- this starts at a young age as well, but the more ready your child is to enter the classroom at kindergarten or first grade, the more successful he or she will be. This includes a wide variety of skills ranging from knowing basic colors or shapes to being able to sit still for a short amount of time, and follow simple instructions.
Help your child be ready to learn when they go to school- often life can get in the way of learning. If a child goes to school in the morning hungry, stressed or tired they are not going to be as successful in their education. Help your child succeed by making sure they have a healthy breakfast, and get plenty of sleep the night before.
Don't let the summer waste away- many of the skills a child learns throughout the year can be lost in the summer months unless a parents is actively engaging their child in educational activities. Take part in a summer reading program at the local library or review different subjects through the summer months. If a child spends 3 months without any review of reading or math skills they can be far behind when they start back in the fall.
Instill in your child a love of learning and desire for education.- the more your child begins to dread school and homework, the less motivated they will be to become independent learners. Encourage your children in their education and be excited to hear about the things they are learning. Take advantage of their natural interest in certain topics and help them explore those.
Reading and learning are so important for school success and success in late life. Help your kids get on the right foot now and it can affect them for many years to come.

A recent report from the Annie E Casey Foundation highlights the importance of reading, especially in the early years of life.  Though we have known for a while how important early reading is, their findings show highlight the importance for a child to be reading proficiently by the end of the third grade.  Children who are reading at grade level by this time are less likely to drop out of high school, and thus are more likely to be higher wage earners, less likely to be arrested, and less likely to have a child as a teenager.
Why is the 3 rd grade so important?
Up to the third grade, education is focused on helping children learn to read .  Activities and instruction are geared toward expanding and sharpening these skills.  However, in the change from third to fourth grade there is a shift in education and instruction.  In the fourth grade typically students are now reading to learn. In order to understand the information being taught in all areas, the student must be able to read at their grade leve.  It is reported that if the student is not proficiently reading at a third grade level by the fourth grade they could miss as much as half of the information being presented. Teachers rely on the students ability to be able to read and comprehend material to teach them about different subjects.  Therefore, lowered reading skills begin to affect all other areas such as social studies, math and science.
Considering how important reading skills are at this age, it may not be surprising to learn that if a student is not reading well, they may also be more likely to have behavioral and social problems. Because of the importance of reading for comprehension at this time, it is easy to understand how a student may begin to act out in other ways if they are not understanding the material being taught.
Who is affected?
According to the report, many students are not reaching proficiency by the third grade, and this is a big problem. These students are our future workers- our future thinkers, educators and businessmen and women- and they are often starting out missing the skills they need. It was found that by the third grade over 50% of students are not reading proficiently. This is regardless of income, race or location (urban, suburban, rural). Even more shocking, however, is that when we consider income, over 80% are not reading proficiently at their age group, in all locations (urban, suburban and rural).
