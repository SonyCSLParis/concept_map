Early Literacy
Reading Readiness for Babies, Toddlers and Preschoolers
What is early literacy? Early literacy is everything children know about reading and writing before they can actually read and write.
Why is early literacy important? Research shows that children get ready to read years before they start school, even from birth. The development of early literacy skills through early experiences with books and stories is critically linked to a child's success in lear ning to read.
What can parents and caregivers do? Parents are important in helping their children get ready to read because:
You know your children best
Children learn best when they are in a good mood, and you know their moods best
You can help your children learn reading skills in ways that are easiest for them
Children learn best by doing things-and they love doing things with you
Take every chance you have to read with your children, tell and talk about stories, say nursery rhymes and sing songs. Early literacy is not the teaching of reading. Your child will learn how to read in school. The most important thing you can do to foster early literacy is to provide an atmosphere that's fun, v erbal and stimulating. When you read, talk and play with your child, you're stimulating the growth of your child's brain and building the connections that will become the building blocks for reading.
What are the pre-reading skills your child can start learning from birth? According to research, there are six pre-reading skills that children must have in order to learn to read:
Print Motivation: Being interested in and enjoying books
Vocabulary: Knowing the names of things
Print Awareness: Noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow the words on a page
Narrative Skills: Being able to describe things and events and to tell stories
Letter Knowledge: Knowing letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere
Phonological Awareness: Being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words
