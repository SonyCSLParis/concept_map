Religion is important to you. You want your children to be educated in a school where your religion matters. You want them to grow up practising their religion on a daily basis, not just once a week in a church or schule. Of course, exactly how intense that religious education is going to be is entirely up to you. That is the genius of America. Religious freedom is real and alive. As a result there are religious schools to suit just about every inclination.
The Various Denominations
The Roman Catholic Church has made religious education the centerpiece of its evangelistic efforts for centuries. As a result, you have over 7,500 schools to choose from in that church alone. There are just as many Jewish schools for you to choose from. Both religions have numerous varieties and subsets of schools available. Most schools in the Roman Catholic church are run by the local dioceses and parishes. But several religious orders such as the Jesuits and Franciscans operate networks of schools across the country. There are also schools run by several sects of the Orthodox Church . Most of the Roman Catholic and Jewish schools will demand observance of their religious customs and teachings. In other words, religion is not optional in these schools.
Finally, a word about schools which are loosely affiliated with a denomination. These schools tend to be more ecumenical and welcoming. They teach religious, moral and ethical values without any aggressive evangelism. Many require attendance at something called 'chapel'. This gathering of the school community offers a chance to remind students that there is a larger power afoot without heavy-duty evangelism or teaching about what that power may be.
The choice is yours. Do you prefer your religion 'light' or 'full strength'? There will be a school out there which will suit your requirements.
