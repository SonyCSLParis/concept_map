The Code of Maryland Regulations 13A.09.09.02B (11) defines "Montessori" as an educational program that is based on the educational philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori as reflected in the qualifications of the teachers, written curriculum, instructional methods, and materials and equipment used to implement the instructional program.
All nonpublic educational programs in the State of Maryland, including Montessori programs, must hold a Certificate of Approval issued by the Maryland State Board of Education before they begin to operate.  The Certificate of Approval issued to a Montessori School states that the school is approved to operate a "nonpublic Montessori educational program." The only exception would be nonpublic schools that are operated by bona fide church organizations that have chosen to register the school with the Maryland State Department of Education as a church exempt school under the exemption provision in state law.
2. What makes a Montessori school different from other schools?
A Montessori school is different from other schools in the following ways:
a. The philosophy of education in a Montessori school is based on the educational philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori. This philosophy is reflected in the qualifications of the teachers, the written curriculum, and the instructional methods, materials, and equipment used to implement the educational program.
b. Teachers in Montessori schools must hold a Montessori teacher credential evidencing successful completion of all academic course work, student internship, and all other requirements established by a Montessori teacher training program in addition to a Bachelor's degree or 120 semester hours of college credit.
c. The content of the educational program of a Montessori school will include English-language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies appropriate to the age or grade level of enrolled students. However, it will also include some areas of study specific to the Montessori educational philosophy.
d. Montessori instructional materials and equipment must be provided to implement each curricular area.
e. Montessori instructional methods, techniques, and procedures must be used to implement the educational program.
