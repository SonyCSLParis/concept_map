Why Montessori?
Montessori is an approach to education with the fundamental belief that a child learns best within a social environment that supports and respects each individual's unique development.
Montessori education is characterized by multi-age classrooms, a special set of educational materials, student-chosen work in long time blocks, a collaborative environment with student mentors, absence of grades and tests, and individual and small group instruction in academic and social skills.

How Do Innovators Think? Monday September 28, 2009 by Bronwyn Fryer
What makes visionary entrepreneurs such as Apple's Steve Jobs, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ebay's Pierre Omidyar and Meg Whitman, and P&G's A.G. Lafley tick?

"...If you look at 4-year-olds, they are constantly asking questions and wondering how things work. But by the time they are 6 Â½ years old they stop asking questions because they quickly learn that teachers value the right answers more than provocative questions. High school students rarely show inquisitiveness. And by the time they're grown up and are in corporate settings, they have already had the curiosity drummed out of them. 80% of executives spend less than 20% of their time on discovering new ideas. Unless, of course, they work for a company like Apple or Google.
We also believe that the most innovative entrepreneurs were very lucky to have been raised in an atmosphere where inquisitiveness was encouraged. We were stuck by the stories they told about being sustained by people who cared about experimentation and exploration. Sometimes these people were relatives, but sometimes they were neighbors, teachers or other influential adults. A number of the innovative entrepreneurs also went to Montessori schools, where they learned to follow their curiosity."
In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works and Shapes Our Lives "both Larry and Sergey were Montessori kids....It's really ingrained in their personalities." This is a powerful, profound statement -- and it is not about Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It is about the big picture impact of Montessori education.  Montessori education shapes the learner. This is not about skills or information or test scores. It is about the formation of personal traits: the way we learn shapes us.
