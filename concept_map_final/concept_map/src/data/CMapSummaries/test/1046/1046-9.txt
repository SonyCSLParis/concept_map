5 Ways to Get Involved at Your Child's School
By Jessica Mendoza
Research shows that parent involvement in education improves student behavior and attendance. According to the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory, students with involved parents are more likely to:
Have higher grades and test scores
Attend school regularly
Have better social skills and improved behavior at school
Graduate high school and go on to post-secondary education
Theresa, a mother of two, says "The parents' active involvement in their kids' education has a positive impact on their success. Over the years, I've volunteered as a team mom, in fundraising, and sometimes helping out the teachers in class. Not only was it fun, but I could also recommend ways to resolve problems and improve the classroom."
So as you get ready for the new school year, think about ways you can get more involved with your child's education. Here are a few suggestions from the Beehive:
Get to know your child's teacher. Attending the parent-teacher conferences is a no-brainer, but make an effort to get to know your kids' teachers at the start of the school year too. If you drop your kids off at school (or when you pick them up), take a few minutes to meet their teachers. If you don't have the time, call or email the teacher to introduce yourself and ask questions.
Join the school's Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Even if you don't have time to head a committee or take on a big project, get your email address added to the school's PTA mailing list. You will receive important information about events and things happening at your child's school.
Talk to the PTA about starting a Facebook group and a Twitter account. Half a billion people are on Facebook. Chances are, many other parents at your kids' school are as well. A Facebook group is a great way to connect with other parents, share tips, post events, and stay informed about what's happening at school.  But don't stop at Facebook.  Start a Twitter account for parents at your children's school.  Tweet everything from "The bake sale starts this Friday. Don't forget your cupcakes!" to "Heard about the lice outbreak. Anyone got tips for what to do?"
Volunteer. With our busy schedules, it can be difficult to find the time to help out. But you can make a big difference by giving a little of your time to help at your kids' school, whether you go to the school field trip to supervise students or help in the classroom. If you can't volunteer during school hours, ask the teacher if there are any projects you can do at home, such as cutting, stapling, and sorting. Volunteering not only helps the school, but it also helps you build a network of other parents and teachers. You'll also be more aware of how your child is doing at school. Plus, it can be fun . . . free trip to the art museum, anyone?
Help your kids with homework. You may not remember how to do algebra problems, but offer to help your child in any way you can. For example, take them to the library to do research projects or help them mix the volcano's lava for their science project. Turn off the TV so your kids will have a quiet place to do their homework, and most importantly, keep a positive attitude. It will rub off on your kids.
