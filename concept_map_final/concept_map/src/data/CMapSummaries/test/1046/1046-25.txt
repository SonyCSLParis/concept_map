Get involved with your school
Schools need the participation of students and parents. Here are some ways that you can get involved.
Opportunities for Parents
Parents and guardians are encouraged to participate in their school community. Contact your school's office for ways that you can volunteer to help . If you have special interests or expertise you'd like to share with your child's class or school - for example gardening - let your school's administration know.
Parents or others who can speak and read in English and another language, and who are interested in acting as volunteer interpreters for parent-teacher conferences and other events, can phone the volunteer coordinator at (604) 713-5836 for further information. The coordinator of Volunteer Interpreters for schools' parent-teacher conferences is located at District Reception Placement Centre located at Moberly Elementary, 1000 East 59th Ave.
The Making Contact, Mentorship program matches elementary school students (grades 4-7, ages 9-13) throughout the Vancouver School District with volunteer mentors to complete a project in an area of mutual interest. This one-on-one mentoring can inspire career choices and life-long interests.
Opportunities for Students
Become better informed about what your City government is doing by getting involved with the City of Vancouver Youth Outreach Team , and let the City know what you think!

Get involved in all kinds of forums, events and meetings. And have your say in municipal election years - vote!
