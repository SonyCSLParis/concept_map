How Can Parent-Teacher Differences Be Prevented or Resolved?
Parents and teachers share responsibility for creating a working relationship that fosters children's learning. This brochure examines the cultural context for parent-teacher relationships, suggests some general strategies for creating a climate in which misunderstandings and disagreements between parents and teachers can be minimized through communication, and discusses some general principles for parents and teachers in dealing with misunderstandings or disagreements as they arise.
What Is the Cultural Context for Parent-Teacher Relationships?
It is important for parents and teachers to remember that they know the child in different contexts and that each may be unaware of what the child is like in the other context. Different people often have different perspectives on the same issue.
For many parents, a fundamental part of the parenting role is to be their child's strongest advocate in the school. Some parents, however, may be reluctant to express their concerns because of cultural beliefs related to the authoritative position of the teacher. Others may have difficulty talking with teachers as a result of memories of their own school years or may be unsure of how to express their concerns to teachers. A few parents may fear that questions or criticism will put their child at a disadvantage in school.
Surprisingly, many teachers -- especially new ones -- are equally anxious about encounters with parents. Most teachers have received very little training in fostering relationships with parents, but with the growing understanding of the importance of parent involvement, they may worry about doing everything they can to encourage parents to feel welcome.
How Can Teachers and Parents Foster Open, Ongoing Communication?
The foundation for good parent-teacher relationships is frequent and open communication. Both teachers and parents share the responsibility for creating such a foundation. There are several strategies teachers can use to establish a climate conducive to open communication. Teachers can:
Let parents know how and when they can contact the school and the teacher. Early in the school year, teachers can explain that they can be reached at specific times or in specific ways; can be contacted directly as questions or concerns arise; and have given a lot of thought to their teaching philosophies, class rules, and expectations. In addition to personal interaction, teachers can use newsletters or can send letters home to provide this information to parents.
Elicit expressions of parents' concerns and interests in preparation for parent-teacher conferences. Early in the school year, ask parents to share their main concerns and goals for their child. Brief questionnaires and interest surveys also provide good bases for meaningful discussions in parent-teacher conferences.
Practice an open-door, open-mind policy. Teachers can invite parents to visit the classroom at any time that is convenient to the parents. When they visit, parents can monitor their child's perceptions of a situation and can see for themselves what the teacher is trying to achieve with his or her students.
Involve parents in classroom activities. Teachers can let parents know how they can be helpful and can solicit their assistance with specific activities. The more involved parents are in what goes on in the classroom, the more likely they are to understand the teacher's goals and practices.
Parents also have an important role to play in fostering open communication. Parents can:
Introduce themselves. At the beginning of the school year, parents can let teachers know when they can be reached most easily (daytime or evening) to discuss their child's classroom experience, and also how they would prefer to be contacted (by telephone, e-mail, or letter or in person).
Be involved in classroom and school activities at whatever level work and family responsibilities allow. If parents cannot volunteer or go on field trips, they can let the teacher know that they are interested in helping in other ways, such as with displays and weekend activities.
Initiate regular contact. Parents need not wait for the teacher to call them; they can contact the teacher at times the teacher has indicated are convenient.
What Are Some Strategies for Teachers and Parents Who Disagree?
On those inevitable occasions when teachers and parents disagree about curriculum, assignments, peer relationships, homework, or teaching approaches, a pattern of open communication can be invaluable for resolving differences. In times of disagreement, teachers should:
Know the school policy for addressing parent-teacher disagreements. Teachers should check school and district policies for handling conflicts or disagreements with parents and should follow the procedures outlined.
Use discretion about when and where children and their families are discussed. Resist temptations to discuss individual children and their families in inappropriate public or social situations.
Parents must know the facts when discussing disagreements with teachers. Parents should:
Talk directly with the teacher about problems. Address complaints directly to the teacher, either in person or by telephone, and then to other school personnel in the order specified by school policy. It is important to check the facts directly with the teacher before drawing conclusions.
Avoid criticizing the teacher in front of children. Besides causing confusion and conflict, criticizing the teacher in front of the child does nothing to address the problem. Criticism may put a young child in a bind over divided loyalties. As children age, such criticism may foster arrogance, defiance, and rudeness toward teachers.
Choose an appropriate time and place to discuss disagreements. Parents should keep in mind that the end of the day, when both teachers and parents are tired, is probably not the best time for a discussion involving strong feelings. If an extended discussion is needed, make an appointment with the teacher.
Parents and teachers share responsibility for the education and socialization of children. Preventing and resolving the differences that may arise between parents, teachers, and children by using constructive communication, respect, grace, and good humor can help make school a pleasant place.

How Can We Help Make Schools Safe for Children?
The primary cause of anxiety for many parents today is protecting their children from acts of violence at school. In general, parents and school officials are concerned about preventing children from becoming either aggressors or victims. This brochure discusses what steps parents and school administrators can take to make schools safer.
What Is Being Done To Ensure My Child's Safety in School?
Despite the extraordinary media coverage of and public concern over violence in our schools, students are safer there than in any other place except their homes. Still, school officials recognize the potential threats to the safety of children attending school and school-related activities. Many are seeking ways to help school personnel control the school environment more effectively and to be more visible and available to students who need better guidance. In some districts, for example, drivers of school vehicles must complete rigorous training in managing student behavior as well as operating their vehicles safely. In addition, more school districts are requiring routine drug screening for vehicle operators and are training school personnel in crisis management and violence intervention. Other violence-reduction strategies include:
Teaching prevention skills. Students are being taught mediation skills (problem solving and communication) and ways to handle their emotions -- especially anger -- without hurting others. These skills will help them avoid potentially dangerous situations. Students are also being taught "safe" behaviors such as doing activities in groups, alerting school personnel if a stranger is on school grounds, and reporting situations that threaten other students' safety.
Providing alternatives to gangs. School districts and communities are working together to offer students alternatives to gang membership, including activities that build self-esteem and help students deal with feelings of powerlessness. Strategies include providing special assistance to students who are at risk of gang membership, creating an atmosphere that fosters a sense of belonging in all students, informing parents and school staff about gangs and teaching students how to avoid being drawn into them, and giving students regular opportunities to discuss school experiences and to plan for future successes and rewards.
Improving school designs. As school buildings are constructed and old ones are renovated, safety has become an essential element of their design. In new schools, office areas are now centrally located for easy accessibility from other locations in the building or campus. Hallways have convenient exits and are well lit. Deadend hallways and staircase hideaways have been eliminated, and restrooms are located closer to administrators to prevent students from hanging out.
Monitoring visitors carefully. Schools are becoming more assertive in screening visitors, requiring them to register when entering the building or campus and by employing security personnel. Schools can be both secure and friendly by requesting visitors to check in rather than report to the office. Registered visitors are given a pass or badge to display prominently to let staff and students know that they have been acknowledged by the administration. Staff and students are instructed to report people without proper identification to a school administrator. In addition, many schools now ask that parents give the names of adults who are allowed to pick up a child, and require those individuals to show identification to school personnel when signing a student out.
How Can I Help My Child Practice Safe Behavior?
Parents can teach their children safe behaviors before enrolling them in school. Children who know the appropriate action to take in a given situation are less likely to expose themselves to danger. Safe behaviors to teach your child are:
Not talking to strangers. This warning is more important today than ever before. Encourage your children to get to know school staff other than their teachers and get acquainted with them yourself. Familiarity helps children recognize adults who don't belong as well as adults who can offer help when needed. As a plus, children will also learn that the school staff are their friends and more than just rule enforcers.
Taking safety in numbers. Encourage your children to stay close to friends and to walk in groups in school hallways. Suggest that they limit their restroom visits to recess and breaks and use facilities located in high-traffic areas or in areas more likely to be visited by staff.
Choosing friends carefully. Encourage your children to avoid students who do not handle anger effectively. Ask your children to be particularly careful with classmates who bring weapons to school and to report any such incidents to their teachers.
How Can I Help Ensure Safety In My Child's School?
As a parent, make it your responsibility to become as active in your child's school as your schedule permits. Here are some strategies you can use:
Visit frequently, being sure to register with administrative personnel when you arrive. Volunteer to help in your child's classroom or elsewhere in the school as often as you can and encourage other parents to visit and volunteer. The more parents are involved and visible, the safer their children's schools will be.
Become a member of the school's Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or other parent-teacher organization. By attending meetings and participating in its committees and activities, you'll become acquainted with other parents and with school personnel.
Get to know your child's friends and their families. Productive friendships and a sense of common purpose among students, teachers, and neighbors make schools and neighborhoods safer.
Where Can I Find More Information About School Safety?
In general, school personnel are excellent sources of information and suggestions. You can also contact your state and national PTA offices, local or state departments of education, or local public or school district libraries for publications outlining school safety practices, legislation, and helpful hints for creating a safer school environment. The following organizations can also assist you in locating more information:

How Can I Be Involved in My Child's Education?
Research studies consistently reveal that high student achievement and self-esteem are closely related to positive parental participation in education. Parents and schools need to work together so all children can succeed in school.
Almost everyone agrees that parents are, after all, their children's first and most important teachers. You, as a parent, have important knowledge about your child's likes, dislikes, needs, and problems that the school may not be aware of. You may also have ideas for improving your child's school. But even though studies show that most parents want to be involved in their children's education, they may not be exactly sure how to go about it, especially if, like most parents, they work during the school day.
Parents often ask the following questions:
What Can I Do To Involve Myself With My Child's School?
He'eia Elementary School values parent involvement by providing numerous opportunities for parents to interact with each other, with teachers, and with students. One important way you can become involved in your child's schooling is to exercise any choices available in the selection of course work, programs, or even schools. He'eia uses "school-based management," in which administrators share the responsibility for operating schools with teachers, students, parents, and community members. You can become involved in committees that govern your child's school or join the local parent-teacher association.
Schools should regularly communicate with parents about their child's progress and the educational objectives of the school. This communication should also include non- custodial parents, stepparents, and any other adults, such as grandparents, who are responsible for the child. If you aren't receiving such information, ask for it. Work with other parents and guardians to be sure that the school understands how best to keep you informed.
He'eia School sends newsletters and calendars home regularly, alerting parents to school functions and ways they can participate. Encourage your school to provide volunteer opportunities for working parents and to schedule some school events outside of the school day to increase participation.
Here are other ideas:
Make arrangements to visit your child's classroom; a visit will give you an idea of what your child does at school and how he or she interacts with other children.
Volunteer to help in the classroom as an assistant (listening to children read, for example, or serving as an aide during computer work).
Support student events and performances by helping with them (such as sewing costumes or painting scenery for a school play) and by attending them.
Drop into the PCNC room in P-2 to meet other parents or to pick up information and materials.
Participate in workshops that are offered, such as those on child development or concerns that parents have (or help plan such workshops).
Take advantage of parent-teacher contracts (perhaps agreeing to read with your child for a certain amount of time each night).
Ask your child's teacher if he or she has materials that you can use to help your child at home and to supplement homework.
Be part of decision-making committees about school issues and problems, such as a Parent Advisory Committee.
How Can I Help My Child With Homework?
Most teachers assign homework on a regular basis because practice is needed before children fully understand new skills or concepts. Homework also increases the amount of learning time available and allows students to do more in-depth learning.
Here are some general guidelines for helping with homework:
Reward progress; use lots of praise; display good work.
Find out how much and what type of homework is assigned in each class, how students are expected to prepare it and turn it in, and what students can do when they don't understand something; help your child manage the workload by dividing it into small doses.
Help your child develop a homework schedule that he or she can stick to.
Talk to your child each day about homework assignments; go over work; see if it's complete; ask questions about it. But don't do your child's homework yourself.
Provide a suitable place for study (if possible, make it quiet and away from the distractions of TV, phone, and loud music).
Avoid making homework a punishment.
How Can I Make Our Home a Good Place for My Child To Learn?
Have high expectations for your child's learning and behavior, both at home and at school.
Praise and encourage your child.
Emphasize effort and achievement, and be a role model for getting work done before play.
Establish rules and routines in the home.
Monitor television viewing.
Limit after-school jobs and activities.
Encourage your child to share information about school and respond with empathy.
If you don't do anything else, read to your young child or have him or her read to you every night. Encourage older children to read by reading yourself and by having interesting and appropriate materials available.=
What Should I Do If My Child Isn't Doing Well in School?
Contact your child's teacher. Don't wait for the school to contact you. It's important to resolve problems as soon as possible when they occur. When parents work with teachers, they are often able to improve a child's performance in school. Children also get the sense that education is really important when they see their parents involved with their teachers and their school. Parents feel a sense of accomplishment, too, when they help their children succeed in school. Ask your child's teacher for specific activities you can do at home with your child and help the teacher better understand what works best with your child. Make it clear that if the teacher sees a problem developing, you want to hear about it immediately. Then, meet with your child's teacher frequently until the problem is resolved.
What If My Child Doesn't Like School?
Using your unique knowledge of your child, try to find out why he or she seems unhappy with school. Observe and listen to your child. The problem may not lie with school itself, but with peers or friends. It may also be a family problem or an issue of self- esteem. Arrange for a conference with the teacher or school counselor. Work toward being able to discuss problems with your child openly, and listen carefully to his or her views before you offer any solutions.
Children whose parents are involved in their education have better grades, a more positive attitude toward school, and more appropriate school behavior than those with less involved parents. So don't underestimate what YOU, as a parent, can contribute to your child's learning experiences, no matter how much education you yourself have. Getting involved in your child's education will make a difference.
