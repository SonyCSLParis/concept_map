Please describe your most pressing classroom-based problem.
My most pressing classroom-based problem is the absence of parents, particularly single parents, in the school lives of my students. The meaningful involvement of parents in their children's school life can boost children's academic and social success in the classroom. Making positive connections with my students' families makes my teaching more effective. While many of my students' parents are involved and committed to our school community, those who fall into the "underachievement' or "low performance" categories also have parents who are not involved in their school lives. Finding ways to make these families feel comfortable in our school setting and making it possible for them to be involved in positive ways is the challenge. Many single parents feel uncomfortable attending school functions because they don't want to come alone or because many of their past school contacts were negative. How can I make contacts with parents to reach out to these parents? What kinds of events might bring them into the school to make connections with the staff and the families of other students?
In what ways do you think teachers in other public schools share similar or related problems?
I think most public schools face this problem. Frequently children who struggle to achieve in school also have parents who are not comfortable in the school setting or not involved in school life. Most teachers would agree that parents who are involved in school (through volunteering or participating in parent groups) have children who are more comfortable and more involved in the school culture. These children also perform better in school. Research shows that the earlier parent involvement begins in a child's school life, the more powerful the benefits (Michigan Dept. of Ed. 2001). Lack of parent involvement has been known to be one of the most pressing school problem for decades. It is a problem nearly every teacher faces.
Please explain how the problem identified can be addressed with $500 or less.
I believe the problem can be addressed by creating and sponsoring activities to promote parent involvement in schools at times that are convenient to parents and with welcoming events that will encourage parents to feel comfortable in the school setting. Ideas could include family fun nights -- perhaps read-ins with free book give-aways, family potlucks, visiting theatrical performances, game night, family gardens, build a birdhouse events, star walks, etc. Teacher training could also be a part of the solution -- helping teachers to learn and practice ways to make contacts with parents welcoming (no school jargon, no talking down, team-building events). Finding ways to involve parents based on what they can bring to the school community (talents, interests, cultural richness) is a challenge as well.
How does this problem relate to teaching and learning in the 21st Century?
A 2007 survey revealed that charter school leaders feel least confident in their abilities to engage parents. If this is how charter school staff feels (and charter schools are usually parent-initiated), then imagine the challenge that faces public schools in the 21st Century. As schools get larger, the personal touch gets lost. School communities are so large they become impersonal. A focus on achievement sometimes leaves out the value of community. Parents who want to be involved get lost in the crowd or are underutilized by school staff with no idea how to make use of parents as a resource. An increasing number of single working parents with little free time becomes a great challenge for teachers and school leaders. These parents need to prioritize their family time to get the most out of it. Schools need to take into consideration the needs of the family and be mindful of ways to bring families together in meaningful ways in the school setting.
