Get Involved During National Parent Involvement Week 2011
This month, during National Parent Involvement Week, November 20-26, and National Parent Engagement Day, November 17, schools throughout Urbana School District will encourage parent involvement through family events and volunteer opportunities. Schools understand that parents are busy people, but there are many different ways you can get involved in your child's education. No matter how little or how much time you have, there are many ways you can positively impact your child's education at school and at home.  Remember, when parents get involved and stay involved, all students achieve at a higher level.
Volunteer at school - Schools often send home lists of various ways that parents can volunteer. If they don't, let your child's teacher, principal, or counselor know your special skills and ask what you can do to help.
Show your child that you care - Have a conversation with your child about school and homework regularly. Ask specific questions that inform you about your child's day. Know what classes your child is taking, who your child's friends are, and other essential information.
Keep in touch with the school - Get to know your child's teachers, principal, counselor, and school's parent involvement coordinator. Make it a point to stay in contact with them throughout the school year.
Express high education expectations - Encourage your child to take challenging courses and monitor your child's academic performance (homework, grades and test scores) throughout the year. Emphasize effort and achievement.
Attend school meetings, functions - Make time to attend parent-teacher conferences, parent fairs, curriculum nights, award ceremonies, and other school events. Your attendance and support matter to your child.
Seek out information -Request a meeting with your child's teacher regarding any aspect of your child's education. If you have other questions, ask the school by calling or sending a note so they can link you with the appropriate person that can respond to your needs.
Be an active part of decision making committees - Participate in parent or school leadership organizations. Ask your school about the Parent Teacher Association or Parent Teacher Organizations, school council, parent advisory committees or other parent organizations and then join one.
Make school important -Talk positively about school with your child. Send your child prepared for school each day with pens, pencils, notebooks, and homework completed. Make school a priority by ensuring they are at school every day and arrive on time.
Be seen at school - Arrange a visit to your child's classroom, have lunch with your child at school. Your presence matters and shows the school that you are invested in your child's education.
Be informed and responsive - Ask, collect, read, and respond, if needed to all information (school policies, field trip information, students handbook, etc) that is sent from your child's school or teacher. If you need to receive information in a language other than English, call or visit the school.
Visit your school's website - Access all kinds of information including homework assignment, class schedules, lesson plans, test dates, and grades on your child's school website. If you don't know your schools website ask your child's teacher or the school.
Participate in workshops that are offered -Look for great opportunities to meet other parents at school through workshops.
Provide a rich learning environment at home - Make time for meaningful dinner conversations, trips, games, reading time, family sports, and daily routines. Activities like these will contribute to your child's academic achievement at school.
