All students are entitled to a safe and productive learning environment. We can all relate experiences we've had involving a bullying situation. When conflicts arise, students need to have a set of practical, effective, and nonviolent tools to deal with a bully. Schools have an obligation to have programs designed to prevent and deal with incidents involving bullying. In order to achieve this, educators need to concentrate on four components: the bully, the victim. conflict resolution tools and strategies, and the classroom/school environment.
Recognizing the Signs Educators and students should be trained to recognize signs of bullying behavior, defuse the situation, and help the victim and bully develop socialization skills. Bullying behavior can include physical harm, persistent teasing, insults, extortion, exclusion of the victim from social interactions, and intimidating facial expressions and body language. Bullies use intimidation to keep others from noticing their weaknesses.
It's also important for educators and students to recognize the signs that a student is the victim of bullying. These behaviors can include staying close to teachers, frequent visits to the school nurse with complaints of not feeling well, reluctance to attend school, withdrawal from others, poor concentration, poor academic performance, and refusal to try new experiences. A student who is anxious about being victimized either during lunch or on the way home from school cannot concentrate on school work.
What to Do Workshops, assemblies, a school campaign, and a school policy of zero tolerance needs to be implemented. A school campaign can include having a school-wide student contract outlining positive school behaviors along with consistently enforced consequences for bullying behavior. Posters, student presentations, art work, and written work can highlight positive character traits to be exhibited in and out of school.
Assembly programs stressing character development and positive social interaction can be held. Consider the following:

What to Do - The Bully Building student competence and confidence is one of the first steps in developing positive character traits.  Interventional school and community services can be provided both for focusing on academic development and social development. Differentiated instruction should be provided so as to motivate and yield more involved students. Cooperative group work, paired work and peer tutoring can foster academic achievement and positive social interaction. Providing time for the teacher to communicate with students will allow students to express fears, emotions, and concerns.
What to Do - The Victim Victims of bullying also need to build positive self esteem and positive social skills. Victims are often students who don't make friends easily and are frequently loners. The steps listed above to help a bully are often the ones suggested in helping the victim to get along well with others and develop friendships.
Create a Positive Environment A positive school environment will promote respectful treatment of others. All students benefit from development of self confidence and social skills. A classroom that demonstrates respect and includes praise will help build confidence and self-esteem.
Focus on students' doing the right thing.
Reinforce positive behaviors and work from students' strengths.
Be a positive role model. Students will emulate teacher's treatment of and reactions to students. When a teacher reacts in a positive manner to students, other students will exhibit similar behavior. When teachers value the contributions of students, students will value the contributions of other students.
Establish a classroom environment that allows students to voice their opinions.
Enforce the concept that each student is allowed to have his/her opinion and can agree or disagree with the thoughts of others.
Provide a forum for students to express their thoughts.
Encourage many solutions to problem solving.
Enable students to express feelings through speaking, writing, art, music, dance, and dramatization.
Develop an appreciation of diversity in population and thoughts.
Provide opportunities for cooperative group work, peer tutoring, and peer mediation.
Confront Bullying Probably the worst thing a teacher can do about bullying is ignore it. Here are some additional strategies.
Introduce and develop sharing of ideas about bullying with discussions, books, audio CDs, videos, DVDs and current events.
Conduct role play activities in which students are confronted by a bully and methods of dealing with the situation.
Provide discussion time for identifying ways in which students can cope with and diffuse a situation involving bullying.

He suggests having a group of students remove the victim from the situation and walk away from the bully together. Then students should report the incident.
