For Parents: A Guide to Fixing Bullying
Bullying is an incredibly dangerous form of assault and violence when it is directed at children. It is a crime in most countries and it is recognized by law as a form of harassment and/or assault. The school is often the place bullying starts and continues with children. It is therefore debatable if the school is then responsible for managing and stopping bullying.
And let me get this off my chest. I am so sick of crappy bullying resources that make the victim feel responsible for being bullied, and suggest they take responsibility for fixing the situation and changing the behavior of the bully. It's an easy way out for schools and education systems to wash their hands of the problem. If you think about it, blaming the victim and forcing them to try strategies to fix the problem themselves, it is yet another level of bullying, this time from the school. This is the first step down the wrong road to helping your child.
Bullying is actually a complex social problem that is causing many schools to now act on the issue. By 'act' I mean do 'something' so the school cannot be accused of being negligent and not taking reasonable steps to address the issue. 'Acting' and 'fixing' are two different things. Schools don't have to fix bullying - they just have to show they were not negligent by ignoring it. The general response from schools is to buy the latest resource, which is usually a DVD and/or a work book, and have children watch the DVD and fill in or color in the workbook. The school has 'acted' and can no longer be held responsible for the outcomes of bullying, because they took reasonable steps to address it. This culture has created a truckload of very poor resources designed by amateurs to help bullying. Unfortunately, most of these are utter rubbish and should be put straight in the bin. I've seen some DVDs use puppets that look and act like even I'd want to hit them.
What hope do we have if the resources we give teachers to help this problem are very poor quality, and are just capitalizing on the need for schools to do and buy 'something' to help? We're just moving from one expensive and ineffective strategy to the next, without dealing with the elephant in the room, the bully. Dealing with the bully is hard and requires a lot of work. The victim is already doing a pretty good job of being a victim by thinking they are at fault and accepting the bullying without reporting it or demanding change, so the school system just blames the victim and they accept the blame. Problem solved for the school, but the victim is one more step towards slashing his/her wrists or going on a school shooting spree.
My Personal Experience
I've been recently bullied myself as an adult, so I know that as a victim, I really wasn't in the situation to be the one to solve the problem. I was too busy being bullied, and the associated anxiety took up about 99% of my brain's ability to think clearly. Even though I am approaching 40, the bullying was enough to stop me working for more than a whole year, destroy my social life and make me incredibly depressed and moderately psychotic. I never thought bullying would ever get to me, but somehow it snuck in, and it created a major mental illness where there wasn't one before. Strangely enough, the person who bullied me was a Principal removed from her school due to major bullying and student suicides, which are continuing even to this day (I think they are up to 8 teenage girl suicides). So I got stuck with an expert bully but called a stop to the situation before feelings of suicide kicked in.
And get this for a complete coincidence. The person I bullied most at school has just found me through Facebook and has sent a 'Friend' request. Now, I was reasonably mean to this person, and I was complicit and did not step in when I witnessed others treat this person REALLY badly. I feel so embarrassed, now that I know how bullying can destroy someone. I'm not sure how I will react just yet. I don't think I could ever apologize enough.
I was also an expert bully when I was 11 and my victim was Brett Hannan. I started a 'I Hate Hannan' club and handed out badges, newsletters and membership cards. It was a weird time in my life when I had some problems at home, and I took out my hurt on the most popular boy in class. I am not sure what happened to change the situation, but soon we became best friends, and I was accepted into the 'popular' group of kids which he led. We had sleepovers all of the time; I was in awe of his Star Wars stuff, and he loved our family's carefree 'DIY' parenting model (which meant stealing money from my parents' room, going to the shop and buying ingredients, then coming home and cooking a meal). But I do remember my attempts at bullying well.
The Popular Resources
Do you want a peek at what schools are doing to address bullying? This example video below has quite simple steps, led by nerds with pulled up white ankle socks and includes the use of surprise violence (throw some peanuts shells in their face). Other gems of advice:
Avoiding inadvertent gangwear (by wearing 100% pure nerd only clothing)
Effective hairpulling and to push the bully's face into the ground
"Run like you have never run before"
A demonstration of strangely laying down on the ground and pointing your toes at the bully, as if in an aerobics class
Pretend that the bully won't remember having peanut shells thrown at them, and that the crowd watching you point your toes at the bully won't be yelling "Fight, Fight!".
Specific advice not to lay on your stomach when dealing with bullies. Because that would be my natural reaction.
PS. "Everything is Terrible" is a great site, but probably banned at your school It probably should be too.
And of course the completely useless crap below for anyone over the age of three. 'All Together Now - A Whole School Approach to Bullying', an anti bullying CD/DVD resource package.  "It makes us sad," sung by a young guy with the biggest smile ever.  And puppets that look just awful - a black child with only a few teeth, a girl with a small clump of hair on her head (like a pinhead), and the biggest ears ever.  Ever.
Let's be honest - 99% of children watching the video would laugh at the puppets and their freakish looks. The song isn't even suitable for young children with its huge vocabulary and lack of positive messages. It is certainly not put together by educators who understand how children learn.
What is bullying?
Targeted bullying is where a normally well behaved person uses clearly identified acts to emotionally, physically and/or mentally attack another specific person. The bullying is often the only inappropriate behavior of the otherwise friendly person and their social group.
I'm going to make a call and say that the most dangerous bullying occurs in the middle years of education - when children are aged 10 to 15.
Why focus on the middle years?
The term "middle years" is used to describe young adolescents at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school (Grade 5 to Grade 9). Students in the 10 to 15 years age group have particular needs that are different from those of young children or older adolescents. In the middle years students generally identify strongly with their peers and value being part of groups. They have stronger emotions and are more sensitive to communication from others, they progressively seek greater independence and develop their individual personalities. They begin to make decisions about adult roles, usually by trial and error. Like a teenage girl trying on different clothes to see if they fit and feel right, middle school children 'try on' many different personalities to see which one they like the most. It is often said that children go through 'phases'. This is simply part of the process of becoming an adult. In just a few months your child may be gay, straight, goth, punk, religious, quiet, extroverted, athletic, ambitious, lazy, neat, filthy, submissive or violent. The 'bully' and the 'victim' are roles that most children will experiment with.
Most students move through these phases without any real issues, but parents and teachers need to watch when any phase 'sticks' or when a phase makes a child disengage from schooling. I don't think that any child could be born a 'bully' or a 'victim', but there would be times when being in these roles meets a need for their emerging personality, or the feedback they get from others around them makes them repeat their actions a second time.
In a group watching bullying take place, there would be students that give the bully great feedback and cheer for them, and there would be others in the same group that would rush up to the victim and give them lots of attention and make sure they are OK. If these reactions meet their current needs, the role of 'bully' or 'victim' might stick:
Bullies may grow from children that feel they have no power or control over their regular life and find this power instead through dominating other students. This of course includes children who are bullied at home or by an older student at the school
Victims may grow from children that are often ignored and longed to be noticed, or that are having a lot of trouble with school and enjoy staying home or being 'taken out' of regular classes
Summing up, if your child is having a fight with one of their friends, this is 100% normal. Children of this age push the boundaries and experiment with what is appropriate adult behavior, and learn by experiencing the consequences, either positive or negative. Just watch out for when one of these roles 'stick' and your child does not move on.
The Growing Brain
After your child's baby/toddler phase from years 3 to 5 years old, the teenage years of 10-15 are the second and last time the child's brain goes through a major growth spurt. As a baby, the brain learns and remembers hundreds of words, voices, shapes, patterns, sounds, faces, movements, behaviors and emotions every day. With proper stimulation, the learning rate of a young child is just incredible.
The teenage growth spurt obviously includes body shapes and hormones, but it also is the time the young adult will develop their patterns of adult behavior, based on experimenting with different roles in society. As the baby was exposed to practically thousands of words every day, the teenager is continually exposed to hundreds of different types of behaviors, and plays by sending these behaviors back to other people. Sometimes they will be nice, most likely they will hit someone at least once, and certainly they will find someone to tease and see what it feels like to be a bully. Within a large group of teenagers and their endless supply of highly charged emotions, most of these short meetings between teens and exchanges of behavior will come and go without incident, but some will spark off a larger reaction that draws people together, in either a positive or a negative way.
Ignore this next bit if you think humans are not just another species in the animal world. Another obvious relationship between teenagers and bullying is recognizing that we are still animals, even though we wear nice clothes and listen to iPods. A natural animal instinct is to 'separate' any different looking animals from the pack. This separation usually involves violence. It's a completely unconscious action, and one that is ingrained into our DNA and can only be overcome by behavior modification therapy (that is, education). My sadistic and stupid brother often made a point of this by catching sparrows and dying them with red ink. He then let the sparrow fly away and then watched as it was attacked and killed by the pack simply because it looked different (and the red sparrow had no idea it was red, which made the bullying even more complicated). That's making it extremely obvious, but a lot of documentaries show packs of lions, schools of fish, groups of moneys etc killing or turning away any animal that is different or looking sick.
And then we remember that the whole point of being a teenager is your child learning how he/she is going to be 'different' from everyone else, as they create their own identity for adulthood. Children who start developing their own identity early will probably experience the most bullying. The 'pack' animals in a group that are yet to develop their own identity will intrinsically attack those that have started to look and act differently. I consider this primate behavior is the main reason behind bullying. Once you and your child understand this, you'll see bullying as a normal and unavoidable phase of being successful, having a strong individual identity, and therefore being a happy adult (well, eventually).
How do your help your bullied child?
Before you go in charging to solve any bullying problem, make sure the bullying does exist, and you are not over-reacting to an isolated incident. Many times it's just one of those hormonal teenager mood swings with "I don't like you anymore," at 2.30pm and "You are my best friend forever," at 2.35pm.
Over-protective parental involvement isn't great at this stage. If you are a parent of a middle-school aged child, do some basic Wikipedia research on normal teenage behavior. Think of Jan from the Brady Bunch. Middle child. Middle years.
This turbulent and ever-changing mind set may seem distressing to parents, but as long as your child feels safe, feels safe going to and from school, and safe at school, there is no need for a knee-jerk reaction of labeling the behavior 'bullying'.
Think of it this way. When you tell someone "I love you," it is a big step which puts a label on the relationship. This completely changes how the people in the relationship treat each other, it changes the way other people see it and reinforce the relationship, and the severely limits the possibility of 'going back' to a time when the words were never said and the label never given.
By labeling a behavior as 'bullying' and defining the role of 'bully' and 'victim', it inadvertently puts into place expected behaviors for the two people involved. This is why it is so important to keep communication open with your child and their teacher, and look out for signs of being bullied early, when the behavior can be described as something other than 'bullying'. Teenagers are going to go through every emotion, behavior and mood swing known known to human kind. This is the whole point of being a teenager, so it is important to let a lot of it happen. Once you single out one of these behaviors, put a fence around it and give it a label of 'bullying', it can get out of control.
My favorite and most personally trusted educational theory is the 'expectancy effect'. Your children will become what you expect them to be. It's a complicated and powerful theory, but basically if you take a regular child and tell them he/she is a bully and treat them like they are a bully, they have a 100% chance of becoming a bully. The same is true if you take the same child and expect them to become a victim. A child might not think they are a victim of bullying, but once you label it and expect the child to be a victim, they'll be the best victim you've ever seen.
And of course this can go beyond the two children involved. It can then be catalyst for a heated exchange between two mothers while waiting to pick up their children after school, or it can create a major fight between whole families that may last for months or years (I've seen this many times unfortunately).
So although Thursday afternoon's story of "Jane called me a fat lesbian," may sound like bullying, Jane is probably going to be invited over on the weekend for a slumber party. As a parent, you have to let a few things go and work themselves out.
I remember once watching a very experienced teacher work her magic on an eight year old child:
A crying child came up to her and said "Mary called me a lesbian.'
The teacher quickly responded"Well, are you?"
The child said "No."
The teacher ended it by saying "Well, you don't need to worry about it then, do you? Now get ready for class."
Bomb diffused. Everything will be forgotten about in the next 2 minutes. The child will never be called a lesbian again if the teacher doesn't draw attention to it. Best possible outcome ever.
Yes, calling someone else a 'lesbian' is teasing and that is wrong, but you don't have to make a big deal out of it. There is a 80% chance that it was a 1-off action that was not even understood by either child, and will never be repeated. A teacher would of course watch to see if future teasing occurred, and then they might step in. But the main goal is to create a safe and happy place for children to learn, and if ignoring one small action means that the children will be friends again in 10 minutes, then ignoring it is fine. Bringing both children to the school office and having them write apology letters to each other is not going to make the situation better. This might be the first time your child has ever been to the school office, so the experience will make a big impression.
My friend and fellow Teacher Syndicate member Jaymie tells me she had her very first 'caning' for rewriting the school newsletter in a satire format, then handing it out it as a joke. In high school she changed her uniform's coat of arms to include very inappropriate icons. She got into a lot of trouble and was forever treated like a trouble maker, which she became. By Grade 10, she was making fake copies of celebrity clothing for assessment in home economics and refining the techniques to copy and reprint trademarks and packaging in art class. Teachers expected this behavior, and she provided it. She then went on to become a well known and popular adult satirist.
If you want to see the expectancy effect in action, there is a very disturbing 'entertainment' skit by Derren Brown, where he calls a man a 'dummy' for a while. The man then literally becomes a dummy. We are social creatures and we want to do what others tell us to do and comply with their expectations, so we will unconsciously fill any role people expect of us.
Think of a similar situation if a child was constantly called a 'bully' or a 'victim'. Before we use powerful language, we need to be sure we're right. Like the 'Price is Right', once you lock in your answer, it's locked in. This is not the time to lock in a bad guess.
So sometimes it is better to let small things go. Imagine you find a nest of baby birds in your back garden. You can choose to tell your five children about it, and then tell your children they should not look at or touch the birds in any way because it may hurt them. Or you could choose not to bring the birds to the attention of your children and give them a chance of surviving. It's not bad parenting. It is smart parenting.
The biggest thing to remember is that this is a short stage your child is going through. How you and your child deals with events during this stage will set them up for how they deal with similar events as an adult. You are teaching your child how to be an adult by your reactions. If you are worried about your child, sit down and have an open talk, let them know you are worried about their behavior, and see if they talk about any of the warning signs of bullying above. Even the shyest teenage girl will tell you exactly what is happening if they need help.
If you are worried about your child, you might also make the incredibly popular choice of getting irrationally angry without confirming any details, driving immediately to the house of the other child involved in an incident, calling out their parents, starting a verbal then physical fight, then ending up on COPS and/or Judge Judy. If you do this, you are teaching your child about how to solve problems through irrational violence and rage, while never dealing with the possible 'bullying' behavior. Your child will either (1) become another violent idiot to earn your approval, or (2) never speak to you ever again about their emotions, because they know you'll react like a violent idiot, and instead completely withdraw into themselves and seek out drugs or other ways of dealing with the problem.
My brother claimed he was bullied once, by his teacher. Now, this is the same incredibly stupid brother from before, so I don't think he could recognize bullying if hit him in the face and left a bruise spelling out "bullying". It was just another excuse for him to skip school, which he never went to anyway. I think the teacher asked him to open a book or something, which offended him greatly. He was about thirteen and labeled the teacher as a "bully". The poor teacher in question was investigated and my family now had a scapegoat for my brother's lack of intelligence and avoidance of school (my brother was actually rescued from an institution when he was 4 and adopted into our family - and by this time his lack of mental stimulation had stunted his brain growth). But the 'bullying' incident was put into our family's history books forever. He was told repeatedly he was a 'victim' and was 'bullied' by a teacher. He has since used this as an excuse for his crazy behavior, even now that he's 45 years old.
What is not bullying?
Before the middle years, bullying looks more like general teasing - with silly songs and rhymes called out to just about anyone. The insults are not based on fact and students really aren't trying to hurt each other. Often when I encountered this behavior in the classroom or in the playground, it was a simple solution to get the children involved to listen to me, apologize to each other and/or shake hands, and then run off and play whatever game I suggested. However, an incredibly anti-social young child may appear in these early years, usually displaying every bad behavior, including random bullying to anyone in their range of vision. The issue in this instance is how the school develops a plan for the behavior management of a particular child. I wouldn't single out bullying as the only problem to address.
The Solution to Bullying
My 16 year old niece has suffered a year of major bullying, making her skip school, withdraw into herself and avoid just about every social event.
I knew my 16 year old niece was being bullied, because:
It was going on for more than three months
The bullying was coming from one group of girls, and directed at her solely and consistently
There were consistent names she was being called, mainly "freak"
She matched about 5 points from the list above.
And now it's better. And not just better, but 'incredible'. For the first time she's not just going to school regularly, but she's also going to slumber parties, school dances and special social events. She's also seeking opportunities to enter art competitions, join youth groups and other activities, which has finally brought her 'out' into the world. She also got her tongue pierced, which everyone including me advised against. Afterwards I did explain to my family this as a very common way of creating a self-inflicted and highly visible wound, for the emotional and psychological scars and bruises they have 'inside' which no-one can see. To acknowledge this pain is a very good step, the sooner the piercing goes, the better.
I gave her a few bits of choice advice that seemed to have helped:
Tell the school. Write a letter and ask to have an appointment to speak with a teacher leader, deputy principal, or principal. Surprisingly, schools will do things to help bullying, but they often don't know about it. Bullies usually don't call a teacher over to witness their bullying, or record the incident on a mobile phone and hand it into the school office. And relying on your child to report bullying is pointless. Any conversation between a teacher and a student will go like "Hey, are you OK?", to which your child will respond "Mnn."
The panel heard that Douglas Rolfe, who taught at Bellarine Secondary College, allegedly formed an inappropriate relationship with the student last year after she wrote him a letter detailing family problems.   Institute lawyer Eugene White said Mr Rolfe's behaviour was a case of serious misconduct because of the personal nature of the correspondence, but it did not have a sexual element.
With this type of extreme over-reaction common, it is no wonder that teachers are not receptive to students wanting to disclose any personal feelings. We ignore, we don't ask, we won't listen. The only responsible way to act is to call in the child protection authorities. This might be OK in large cities, but since 90% of schools are in regional areas, the child and family will get very little support from any child protection authorities. And unfortunately the 'officer' will most likely be a very inexperienced young person. As teachers we know that reporting will cause extreme tension within the family, and this may not be 100% resolved by a single 30 minute visit by a young government officer. Summing up, the days when students could talk to teachers about their own lives are over. This is now your job as a parent.
Put it in a letter, speak to someone in charge, and see what happens. Trust the school for a week or two. This is what they do. They are professionals trained to deal with this. You will need to make a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. You should be given something in writing either at the initial meeting or the secondary meeting. If you not get anything in writing, write a letter to the school confirming you have asked for feedback in writing and you have received none. As per usual, keep a photocopy of everything (buy a cheap $60 computer scanner/printer that can make copies, even if you don't have a computer).
A trick which usually makes a child (the bully) disappear from a school (that I have used more than once I'm afraid) is to call the parent in for an interview, and bring up a concern that the student/bully has shown signs of depression and anxiety, and under mandatory child protection laws, the school will need to call in a child therapist from the Department of Families (or something) to interview the child and maybe visit the child at home. Children who are bullies are usually abused children, and parents of abused children really don't want any investigation near them. They know exactly what is happening to make the bully so angry, although they probably didn't know the bully was redirecting that anger onto another child. They know what Uncle Bob does when he is babysitting, or what Dad does when Mum is working the night shift. They just want to pretend it is not happening and they won't want anyone else to find out. Tomorrow the bully will be at a different school. The parents will do anything to stop those annoying child welfare officers visiting again.
When I taught in the worst of worst schools, we had a 'Community Liaison Officer', who basically just hung around and looked like a violent and short tempered bouncer for a night club. If I was having problems with a child, he would come along to one of my classes, pull the bully aside and whisper "I know where you live." That worked a treat and the bully's face would contort as he/she tried not to urinate immediately. I would guess that 99% of parents would never think a school would so such a thing. Schools won't tell you. Your children won't tell you. But schools do what they have to do.
At another school I had to make a point that once the bully leaves school property, the school cannot protect them anymore. So if the 'victim' wants to get his older brother, uncle and random family friends to attack the bully after school, then he/she is free to do so. The bully became paranoid about walking home and watching around corners. The bully and the victim actually became friends after that. I think in this case the bully was an attention seeker, and he was worried about another popular child getting some of that attention. When they teemed up, they got a lot of attention. Problem solved.
Here's some good strategies for your child to recover:
Call bullying what it is
Bullying, cyber-bullying or any other type of similar behavior is assault. It is illegal and it is a crime. It is a dangerous form of aggression and it is looked down upon in most societies. Talk to your child about what is actually happening to them. Don't down-play bullying with any stupid "sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me" advice passed down from generation to generation.
Your child needs to realize they are, or were being assaulted by another person. Although the assault may not leave bruises, it will leave emotional scars that are just as painful, if not worse. Tell your child that no-one has the right to assault them, either physically or verbally. Tell your child it is your job as their parent to protect them, so you will be meeting with staff from their school and demanding that the school put into place a plan to stop the bullying. Tell your child that you love them and you will never tolerated anyone assaulting them. If you don't feel skilled enough to do this, post traumatic stress counseling might be a good idea. Your family doctor could recommend a good counselor.
Your child has to believe that bullying is very similar to letting anyone come up to them and hit them over the head with a big stick, and then not reacting. Once your child has the gained the concept of self protection, they will react differently when approached by a bully. Their eye contact will change, they will refuse to let the bully finish what they are saying, they will state what will happen next, and then they will diffuse the situation.
Remember that we're still talking about children here. The bully is a child, and children respond very well to clear instructions and strong expectations. Your child is not trying to calm down a 48 year old man with a gun holding hostages in a post office. Your child is confronting another child about something minor like name-calling, and getting a positive outcome between two children is very easy when you know how. Bullying is not the end of the world, so don't treat it like it is.
Learning Strategies to Fight Back
When a child realizes they are not the only person in the world to suffer from bullying (teenagers are very ego-centric and usually can only think about themselves) a huge weight is lifted from their shoulders. Often we see clips on television about bullies sharing their own movies, but the 'victim' social network is much stronger, more organized and has much better and more fun resources.
Here's another L-O-N-G video that is useful, calling the response to bullying 'Verbal Judo' which is a nice idea.
There are heaps of videos on You Tube like this one, which is particularly good:
Again, if you don't believe that humans are part of the animal world, ignore this next bit. The Dog Whisperer has some very good information about how animals show their dominance and become the leader of a pack. Again, this is about how animals unconsciously react to other animals, and there are similarities between how dogs can be dominant, and how teenagers can use the same techniques. Dominant dogs don't usually fight and they hardly ever make any noise. They just use their body language, eye contact and highly managed interactions to place themselves above others.
A leader of a human pack will do the same. The popular children, or leaders, will not have to fight with each other to find out who is stronger, they will not have to give everyone gifts, and they will not have to have the most expensive clothes. They simply know how to control a situation. They won't let a bully speak to them. They won't go to places where they can be teased. They will control what other people know about them. They achieve what they need without threats, without making enemies, or without compromising their standards. This is where it is great to share stories with your child about how you got through childhood. Because if you don't share your successful strategies for dealing with bullying, how else are they going to learn?
Turning victimization into positive action
There's a lot of ways that victims can get their own back, turning their bullying into a positive experience. Here's a wonderful (but sweary) clip of victims being assertive on You Tube, which went onto create a worldwide You Tube hit.
Victims can also talk to their local politicians or police to start an action group or series of school events, or they could invite the top business leaders in the community to the school to talk about bullying during one lunch period. I remember a Police visit when I was of the bullying age, and they don't give presentations about how the world is full of flowers and fluffy bunnies. They really push the message home about how bullying can lead to a life of violence and aggression, which usually has them end up dead, the methods of death usually graphically described by the police.
Bullying is a horrible but common part of becoming special
There are many You Tube campaigns where today's teenage idols go on the record and talk about the bullying they have faced. The general points are that bullying is normal for people who have talents and stand out from the crowd, but very importantly, bullying should never be tolerated. Here's a few:
5. Revenge .
You know what? Dealing with anger and hurt is a very, very important part of becoming an adult. Many times we have anger and keep it inside (which leads to self harm like alcoholism or drug abuse) or we deflect it onto other people close to us (which leads to family violence like violence, neglect or emotional abuse).
Part of being an adult is recognizing the anger, and getting angry at the right person. There are two methods I would recommend here.
(1) Laughing at bullies and spreading around bully-related humiliation media, like this one:
or (2), Cold Reading for Bullies (this is really bad advice, use only as a last resort).
Cold Reading is what psychics do - they look at a person and guess some pretty obvious facts about their lives, and the target is shocked and bewildered that someone knows their personal secrets. Cold reading is however very simple and plays on the fact that we think we are special and unique individuals, when actually we are animals, and as animals we have shared patterns of behavior, family relationships, hopes and dreams (there's a good South Park episode about it). If someone is fat and is told that they have trouble managing their anxiety, they will think someone is reading their mind, because no-one would know their awful secret of over-eating when they are stressed. Here's a link to a short booklet that describes cold reading in less than 660 pages.
Cold reading for Bullies can be very mean. If you want to make a bully crack up, go home and cry, your child can do it easily. This won't look nice to read, but in the world of teenage bullies, getting one-up on the bully's abuse means winning the fight. Cold reading is best done in a 1:1 situation, because if your child 'hits the spot' with the bully, it could be very cruel if witnessed by other children. If done in isolation, the bully will most likely return to their pack and advise that the victim should no longer be treated like the victim. A friendship will possibly develop if the bully feels they have an affinity and can share their secret with the bully. See the opening of the film "I Love Beth Cooper" for an example.
So let's do some cold reading research:
A bully is full of rage and anger (a product of hurt) and feels the need to humiliate others
Something in their life is hurting them and humiliating them
The bully is scared of what is hurting them, and is not strong enough to face it, so they redirect their anger/hurt to someone else
Essentially, someone else is bullying your bully and the bully is doing their best to hide it and they are worrying that they are not hiding it enough
Although they are acting tough, they are just one simple step away from total breakdown
A bully wishes someone knew their secret so they didn't have to hold it inside all of the time
Some of the potential reasons for the bully's anger:
They are being sexually abused by their father, or the sexual abuse has stopped and is now directed at a younger sister or family friend, and now they are strangely jealous or hurt
Their parents are getting a divorce, possibly because the father is having an affair with a younger female
They have a hidden eating disorder
They cannot afford the clothing they wear, and steal it from shops or from other people's clothes lines
The father has disappeared and has not come home, possibly because they are having an affair
The family is going through bankruptcy but is still very materialistic and acts like it is not happening
The mother has cancer, possibly breast cancer or ovarian cancer
The bully's older sibling has been kicked out of home for drug use
The bully's father is no longer seeing him/her every two weeks and has become unreliable
Whatever is happening, you can be sure that the bully is blaming him/herself, because that's what teenagers do. Bullies are actually easy targets to bring down with a few words or a few gestures because they are already nervous wrecks, totally confused about what's happening in their world.
Talk to your child about the bully, what they have noticed about any changes in their behavior, who takes them to school, if they have to leave classes to take phone calls or report to the office for a meeting, or if they don't want to go swimming anymore and be seen in a swimsuit.
Once you have narrowed down the reasons, it's time to come up with the verbal defense. You child should not let the bully finish what they are going to say. Cut them off before they can finish any teasing and move in with a blocking statement that will basically short-wire the bully's brain and put them in a state of massive confusion. Although the message is mean, but it must be said in a positive statement, because our brains will do anything to accept a positive statement and label it as 'true'. The verbal defense should sound like it is coming from a friend, trying to help the bully or point out a good feature.
Possible statements to the bully could include:
"Look, obviously there's some f'd up stuff happening in your life at the moment that's making you a total bitch, but from now on, count me out. I've had enough."
"Are you still going on about that? You should be more worried about what they are saying about you."
"Really, move on and find another way to get rid of your anger. Join a gym. Go for a run. Come back when you're ready to be my friend."
"Um, that dress is getting really tight at the back. You don't want the stitching to break. Have a look when you get home."
"Hey, just letting you know that some of the guys are saying some pretty gross things about you behind your back. Just watch it, hey."
These type of open responses are the best cold readings because you have 99.9% chance of causing a reaction. The bully will have something wrong with their lives that they are ashamed of. We all have things in our lives we are ashamed of, something that is constantly in our minds worrying us and causing us anxiety. Call the bully's bluff and act like you have found out what it is. If the bully wants to know what you know, just answer "Really, you don't know?", "I'm not going to be the one to say it and let other people hear it," or "Look, I didn't even want to know and I wish I wasn't told about it. It's just too personal and I don't agree with saying those things."
This will cause the bully to do two things. (1) They will be totally confused because they will be running lots of secrets through their mind and thinking of which one you might know, and (2) feeling a connection to you because you know about their close secrets and have not used them to crush the bully. To bring the confusion to a climax, find a reason or invent an activity when you publicly show great respect to the bully. Pick the bully to receive the next turn in a game. Thank the bully publicly if you are doing an oral presentation. Say goodbye to them at the end of school with a lot of respect. Keep the details and contact time to a minimum and use very general verbal remarks and facial gestures (a smile with pity, like saying "Don't worry, you'll get through it.") You can guarantee the bully won't be sleeping that night.
If you do find out actual facts about your bully, like his/her parents are divorcing, or that her sister is in jail, or that his/her father has just been fired, then your cold reading can be more effective in messing with the bully's mind:
"It's not just me you're hurting. You'd better think about what you're doing to your family."
"Wow, whatever you are doing to lose weight, it's working really well." (for an obvious eating disorder).
"How could you do that to your family? You just don't know when to stop! You've got to control yourself. "
"You can just shut up. If you learn to control your mouth your father might just come back home."
"Why do you bother coming to school? You're just going to turn our like your sister anyway. You're not even trying to be better than her. "
And then you can just get horrible, throwing out comments in the right context:
"You're eating that?"
"Daddy's little girl is looking a bit pudgy. From the back it looks like you're getting cankles. I've never seen cankles in real life."
"Are you missing your period or something? Are you checking what have you done to yourself? "
"Sorry, I can't look at you with that hair on your lip. It's freaking me out."
"What pills are you on? Are you getting enough?"
"You're not gay are you? I didn't believe it either."
"What, can't you afford [insert acne product]? My aunt had it that bad and it went permanent."
"Why aren't you shaving yet? I can buy you a razor if you want me to."
If the bully finds out that you know nothing and have been just bluffing, have a laugh and be totally honest about it. "I can't believe you even thought about it for one minute. What's going on in that head of yours? I can't believe that even I could freak you out."
