Suggests how to deal with a bully at school. Includes hints on whether your child is being bullied and how to talk to your child about bullying. It is essential, according to van Gurp, "for children to understand the difference between tattling (getting someone into trouble) and reporting (being helpful)." 1-02
"Studies have established that approximately 15 percent of students are either bullied regularly or are initiators of bullying behavior (Olweus, 1993).
"Bullies appear to have little anxiety and to possess strong self-esteem. There is little evidence to support the contention that bullies victimize others because they feel bad about themselves."
"Olweus (1993) details an anti-bullying approach that involves intervention at the school, classroom, and individual levels." "Schools that have implemented Olweus's program have reported a 50-percent reduction in bullying."
The article points out that the consequences of ignoring bullying can be severe. "A strong correlation appears to exist between bullying other students during the school years and experiencing legal or criminal troubles as adults. Chronic bullies seem to continue their behaviors into adulthood, negatively influencing their ability to develop and maintain positive relationships." "As many as seven percent of America's eighth-graders stay home at least once a month because of bullies." "Being bullied often leads to depression and low self-esteem - problems that can continue into adulthood (Olweus, 1993; Batsche and Knoff, 1994)." 2-02
"The key components of the bullying intervention program, according to Olweus, are increased adult supervision in all areas of the school, increased consequences for bullying behavior, and a clear message that bullying will not be tolerated."
Other recommendations include the following.
"Place primary responsibility for solving the problem with the adults at school rather than with parents or students."
"Project a clear moral stand against bullying."
"Include both systems-oriented and individual-oriented components."
"Set long-term and short-term goals."
"Target the entire school population, not just a few problem students."
"Make the program a permanent component of the school environment, not a temporary remedial program."
"Implement strategies that have a positive effect on students and on the school climate that go beyond the problem of bullying." 2-02
Discusses why persons do not combat bullies. Also discusses the two stages of bullying.
"In most cases, the bullying follows a two-phase procedure. Phase one is control which is exercised through constant trivial daily nit-picking criticism etc. Eventually there's a defining moment when the target realises that the criticisms have no validity and that they constitute bullying. The target asserts their right not to be bullied, perhaps by initiating a grievance, and the bullying moves into phase two: elimination, which is achieved by dismissal...." 1-02
Concludes that "The most successful strategies to help children develop social competence are those implemented as part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to nurturing children at home, at school, and in the community." 2-02
Suggests how to deal with a bully at school. "First and foremost, teachers must make it safe for students to report bullying. It is crucial that teachers, administrators and other school personnel respect the anonymity of the victim and/or reporting students."
Adults need to be able to identify bullying. "Many bullies try to pass off acts of aggression as rough-housing between friends, just having fun. However, there is a difference between bad play and bullying." The bullier has much more power than the target, the bullier intends to hurt or humiliate, and the bullier repeats the behavior.
"Finally, the most effective tool for dealing with bullying is to mobilize the masses of students who are neither victims nor bullies to take action against bullying." 1-02
Suggests how to deal with a bully at school. "By bringing kids to a place of mutual respect, the cruel and unusual punishment of bullying can be stopped." "When bullies are not stopped, they grow up and start rumors about you at work, follow you too closely on the freeway, beat up their spouses ... and raise new little bullies next door." "The goal isn't to get rid of the bullies, but to get rid of the bullying." "'We think of a bully as a person,' says Sagarese. 'It is a group behavior.'" 1-02
Discusses how to make schools emotionally safe for children. "Punishing intolerance and disrespect is not a way to teach tolerance and respect. That is the model we have now."
Kate: "Then how do you see teaching tolerance and respect? How do you go about putting that into a school?"
Jane: "You put kids in situations where they are interacting with people who are different from them but with a shared goal. For example, one of the principals I worked with took over a school that was an absolute mess - totally unsafe. She took some of the biggest bullies, some of the toughest kids in the class, and paired them with the special-needs students. Suddenly, all kinds of behavior changes started happening."
In order to change bullying behavior, Jane Bluestein suggests putting bullies in roles of mentoring others. "We know we can take these low-social-skills kids and put them in a situation where they can be a helper, where they can do service, or be a mentor with somebody who looks up to them, somebody who needs something they have, somebody who respects who they are and what they have to offer, that's when we see the changes." 3-02
Provides recommendations for schools use school wide strategies to reduce bullying. "Serious international academic studies have found dramatic reductions in bullying of between 20-80% when school wide strategies are used."
'Successfully dealing with bullying involves building a genuine community within the school. Everyone accepts they have the right to be free from harassment and that they have the responsibility to support their weaker and more vulnerable peers.'
"The goal is to sell the idea that stopping bullying is everyone's responsibility." 2-02
In this approach, the teacher assembles a group of six to eight students, including the bully, bystanders, colluders, and the victim. "The teacher does not attribute the blame but states that she knows that the group is responsible and can do something about it." "About a week later the teacher discusses with each student, including the victim, how things have been going. This allows the teacher to monitor the bullying and keeps the young people involved in the process." 2-02
Concludes that "Bullying is a serious problem that can dramatically affect the ability of students to progress academically and socially. A comprehensive intervention plan that involves all students, parents, and school staff is required to ensure that all students can learn in a safe and fear-free environment." 2-02
Step seven is "If neither the parents nor the school personnel show appropriate concern followed by action, go higher in the school administration. If this proves unsuccessful, send a copy of the report of all events to date to the police for their files and advise them that you are seeing a lawyer. If money is a problem, low cost legal help is available in most cities."
Step eight is "Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1992, schools have a legal responsibility to ensure that a nonhostile environment is available to all students." 3-02
Suggests seven elements in a school campaign against bullying. "It must involve all school personnel, other professionals as needed, students and parents." Suggests 13 elements in a community campaign against bullying. 3-02
Provides suggestions for helping victims reduce bullying behavior and for helping your child not to bully others. Examples include, "your child should assert himself just once. If it doesn't work, move on to something else, or the bullying may escalate." "Whatever you do, don't encourage your child to fight the bully." 2-02
Provides details of bullying facts found in the research by Olweus. For example, even though 15 percent of students in Norway and Sweden are involved in bullying situations, a higher percent was found in a study in the United States. Olweus reported that "in a recent large-scale study (Melton et al., 1998) of more than 6,000 middle school students from grades 4 through 6 in rural South Carolina, 23 percent reported that they had been bullied by other students 'several times' or more frequently during the past three months. Approximately 20 percent reported that they had bullied other students with the same frequency (see Figures 3 and 4)." 2-02
Suggests how to deal with a serial bully in the workplace when the serial bully feigns victimhood. "The top four groups of people who contact the Advice Line and Bully OnLine are teachers, nurses, social workers, and those in the charity / voluntary sector." 1-02
"The serial bully exhibits behaviours congruent with the diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder," Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and possibly Borderline Personality Disorder.
"Mediation with this type of individual is inappropriate. Serial bullies regard mediation (and arbitration, conciliation, negotiation etc) as appeasement, which they ruthlessly exploit...."
"It is a key identifying feature of a person with a personality disorder or psychopathic personality that, when called to account, they will accuse the person who is unmasking them of being the one with the personality disorder or psychopathic personality from which they (the bully) suffer." "If this trap is being used on you, assert 'projection' as a defence against disciplinary action or as part of your legal proceedings."
When the bully is confronted by an impartial review, the bully denies everything he or she is alleged to have done and then counter-attacks. If these strategies are not effective, the serial bully feigns victimhood. 1-02
