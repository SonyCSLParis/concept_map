Over time bullying can cause terrible anguish and suffering in the victim, often leading to low self-esteem and anxiety, but sometimes driving people to such extremes as self-harm and suicide. This article will attempt to consider the issue, using several examples, and take a look at some possible solutions. Of course, there are many types of bullying and each specific situation is different - but perhaps what follows can be considered a starting-point, the first step in a discussion which can pursue this topic on the message fora.
We encounter people who tend to behave as bullies from time to time in all walks of life and most people generally avoid them. Bullying only thrives in situations where we are forced to encounter such people repeatedly - typically in school, in the workplace or in family/social groups.  In each of these settings the bully may gain repeated access to his/her chosen victim and make them suffer repeated episodes of humiliation or pain. Recently bullies have been known to employ text-messaging and online social-networking sites to transmit damaging and upsetting information to (or about) the victim.
In most cases, particularly bullying at school, the workplace or in the family, bullying is the result of a failure on the part of those in charge. Your employer is obliged to provide a safe workplace, schools are supposed to create an environment where each child may grow and develop free from fear, violence or persecution. And each famiy-member is expected to look out for the others - this is especially true of parents in their responsibility towards the children in their care.
Let us look at some typical instances of bullying and consider what the victim may do to help his or her situation:
In the Workplace: In recent years there has been a significant rise in reports of bullying at work. Many people's working life is transformed into a miserable and fearful drudge by the actions of vindictive colleagues. This can take many forms - the circulation of rumors, unfair rostering, remarks made to (or about) an individual or even physical harm. In some instances people have been targeted by a supervisor or have been targeted because they have been promoted to a supervisory position.
The good news is that very many workplaces have a policy on bullying and a pre-defined mechanism for dealing with such allegations. For example, the health service in Ireland has a policy called Dignity in the Workplace. This provides trained contact people, mediators and the possibility for a full investigation of bullying in any health service work-setting.
If you are being bullied at work a good first step might be to enquire as to whether such a policy is in place at your workplace. If not you can ask the HR department how cases of bullying are dealt with. If there is a policy or guidelines in place, then following them is often a good plan. After all, most employers will wish to be seen as following their own policies - if they fail to do so they may weaken any defence in a future Labour Court hearing.
Another important step is to speak to trusted colleagues about the problem - perhaps the perpetrator has bullied others and a joint approach can be made to management. If several people come forward together this strengthens the complaint considerably. Also, be sure to take a note of times and dates when bullying occured, along with the names of any witnesses.
If no satisfaction is obtained by reporting the bullying at work, then it can help to take the advice of a lawyer - at least you can be assured of your standing under the law.
It is a tragic truth that many people leave jobs to escape the cruel ministrations of a bullying colleague. Sometimes they successfully sue - but this is cold comfort for the loss of a career. However, in most cases the problem can be solved with  thoughtful and appropriate action on the part of management. Often in the case of a complaint of bullying the alleged offender is transferred or temporarily suspended while the complaint is under investigation. This can provide immediate relief. Sometimes the problem can be fixed by a quiet word from the boss, indicating that bullying behaviour will not be tolerated. And, often, colleagues will no longer tolerate the bullying (which they may have previously perceived as a "bit of fun") - when the bully loses his / her audience they may cease to behave in this way. For many bullies, they are seeking approval from their peers by being tough or funny or overbearing.
So, although there are no absolute answers, there are positive steps which can be taken - and which very often lead to a resolution.
Examples of Bullying at work:
Humiliation, intimidation and verbal abuse
Victimisation, exclusion and isolation
- especially where a complaint of bullying is raised
- isolation by fellow colleagues, being ignored at work/in the canteen
Intrusion or pestering, spying and stalking
Repeated unreasonable assignments to duties that are obviously unfavourable to an individual
Repeated requests giving impossible deadlines or impossible tasks; and taking credit but not blame
Requested to preform unreasonable duties to which the individual has no training
At school: Typically bullying at school involves one pupil become the victim of a group who degrade, hurt or humiliate them on a regular basis. Often there will be a ring-leader in this group. It is surprising how many school-children drift into such groups as a defence against being the victim.
Bullying at school may leave scars on the self-esteem of the victim which last a lifetime. Many school-children have killed themselves because of bullying.
Unfortunately it is often the case that the levels of bullying and the severity of the bully's behavior worsens over time - especially if they have the impression that they are getting away with it. Sometimes this leads to quite shocking behavior.
Becaue of the potential seriousness of school-bullying it is essential that the victim alerts his / her parents (or guardian) to the fact that they are being bullied. This can be difficult as children are very often quite embarrassed by their victim status. An observant parent should become aware that "something is wrong" by the changes they will notice in their child (becoming withdrawn, low mood, attempting to avoid school, unexplained bruises, etc.).
The parent needs to approach the head-teacher and explain the problem clearly, naming the offending children, and making it clear that they will not tolerate this any more. Should the problem re-occur the parent should again contact the head-teacher and explain that any further instances will result in a formal complaint to the police and a strong letter to the Department of Education. Schools can be very lax in dealing with cases of bullying - it is important that they realise that the parent means business and will make things difficult for them if the bullying continues. At this stage the parent may also want to contact the parents of the offending child, outlining the consequences of further bullying - regrettably it is often the case that children who bully have learnt to be aggressive from their parents and a positive response may not arise from taking this step. So it is important to take care and only speak to the bully's parents if they are known to you and you feel that it might be productive.
Examples of Bullying at school:
Physical Bullying
Causing Physical Injuries
School pranks
Teasing and abusing
Verbal and Indirect Bullying
Spreading bad rumors about people
Keeping certain people out of a "group"
Getting certain people to "gang up" on others (It also could be considered physical bullying)
Ignoring people on purpose
Whispering to another in front of someone
Walking in groups at school
Keeping secrets away from a so-called friend
Bullying also can happen on-line or electronically. This form of harassment is known as cyber-bullying. It occurs when someone bullies through the Internet, mobile phones or other electronic means. As we are spending more time on the internet and in particular on social networking sites, this form of bullying is becoming more and more common.
Examples include:
Sending mean spirited text, e-mail, or instant messages.
Posting inappropriate pictures or messages about others in blogs or on Web sites.
Using someone else's user name to spread rumors or lies about someone.
Resolution of the problem depends on the resolute attitude of the parent and the competence of the teachers. Good schools will have a proactive strategy in place for dealing with bullying, but many do not.
In the family:
Family life is a complex area and no two families are very much alike. Each family group has a unique mix of personalities and circumstances. When bullying occurs within families it is often a younger child falling victim to an older sibling. Parents must be on the lookout for signs of bullying among their children and should have clear rules about violence or cruelty among them. If bullying is happening and a parent becomes aware of it they need to take swift and clear action - if both parents are at home they must present a united front and make it clear to the offending child that the behavior will not be tolerated. Limits must be set, with clear punishments for further incidences, then these must be rigorously enforced. This can be done in a loving and supportive way and backed-up by supervised activities where both the bully ad the victim have fun together. Other siblings have a role to play too - they can often report on the state of relations between the victim and the bully and can be encouraged to "mind" the younger child. Again, success is contingent on the resoluteness of the parent(s).
Before we conclude we should consider another important point. Many victims of bullying go on to become victims in other settings. Those who seek to bully or victimise others are quick to recognise a lack of confidence or signs of "weakness" in the those around them. Sometimes low self-esteem or a timid disposition will make one appear to be a good candidate for bullying or similar suffering. The ultimate solution to bullying is not to deal with instances of bullying as they occur, but to stop being a victim!
This is easier said than done, but some things can help. For people who feel physically vulnerable it can be helpful to enroll in a martial arts class or a good boxing club (it is amazing how many accomplished martial artists and boxers will tell you that they got involved due to bullying). For those who are nervous in social settings or who lack self-esteem, a debating club or drama group may be of help. In fact anything which boosts confidence and engenders self-esteem will help to dramatically reduce the chances of being considered a victim.
As we said at the outset, bullying is a vast area. I hope that this article will stimulate thought and even, perhaps, disagreement. I look forward to reading any comments you might have on the message boards.
