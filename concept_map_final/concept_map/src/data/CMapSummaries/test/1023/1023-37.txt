AUSTIN PREPARATORY SCHOOL BULLYING PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PLAN DECEMBER 2010
I. Introduction
Austin Preparatory School is committed to building a school community where all persons are treated with respect based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. To maintain a positive learning environment where teaching and learning can take place on a daily basis, the school expects all of its members to follow the one great commandment: "Love the Lord your God with your whole heart and soul and mind; and love your neighbor as much as you love yourself." (Matthew 22.34-40) Crucial to the success of Austin's educational mission is the commitment of all its members to mutual respect and working together to achieve common goals.
Expectations of behavior are clearly stated in the Parent/Student Handbook and in the Faculty Handbook, but in response to the new Massachusetts law that took effect in 2011, Austin parents, students, faculty, staff and alumni have created this Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan. This plan outlines what Austin Preparatory School plans to do to prevent bullying, cyber-bullying and retaliation as well as how the school will intervene when bullying, cyber-bullying or retaliation does occur.
II. Policy against Bullying, Cyber-bullying and Retaliation
It is essential that a safe, positive and productive educational environment be established at Austin Preparatory School where students can achieve the highest academic standards and where no student shall be subjected to Bullying, Cyber-Bullying or Retaliation.
Since Bullying, Cyber-Bullying, Retaliation or other similar disruptive or violent behaviors constitute conduct that disrupts both a student's ability to learn and a school's ability to educate its students in a safe and embracing environment, bullying is prohibited on School Grounds, on property immediately adjacent to School Grounds; at any school-sponsored or school-related activity, function or program whether on or off School Grounds; at a School bus stop; on a School bus or any other vehicle owned, leased or used by the School; or through the use of technology or an electronic device owned, leased or used by the School.
Bullying is also prohibited at a location, activity, function or program that is not school-related or through the use of technology or an electronic device that is not owned, leased or used by the School if the act or acts in question create a Hostile Environment at school for the Target; infringe on the rights of the Target at school; or materially and substantially disrupt the education process or the orderly operation of the School.
Retaliation against any person who reports Bullying or Retaliation, provides information during an investigation of Bullying or Retaliation, or witnesses or has reliable information about Bullying or Retaliation is also prohibited.
Definitions under the Law
Bullying as defined in Massachusetts law is the repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal, or electronic expression or a physical act or gesture or any combination thereof, directed at a Target that causes physical or emotional harm to the Target or damage to the Target's property; places the Target in reasonable fear of harm to himself or herself or of damage to his or her property; creates a hostile environment at school for the Target; infringes on the rights of the Target at school; or materially and substantially disrupts the education process or the orderly operation of a school.
Cyber bullying is bullying through the use of technology or electronic devices such as telephones, cell phones, computers and the Internet. It includes, but is not limited to, email, instant messages, and Internet posting.
Cyber-Bullying is also bullying through the use of any electronic communication, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by wire, radio, electromagnetics, photo-electronic or photo-optical system, including, but not limited to, electronic mail, internet communications, instant messages or facsimile communications.
Cyber-Bullying shall also include the creation of a web page or blog in which the creator assumes the identity of another person or knowingly impersonates another person as author of posted content or messages, if the creation or impersonation creates any of the conditions enumerated in the definition of Bullying.
Cyber-Bullying shall also include the distribution by electronic means of a communication to more than one person or the posting of material on an electronic medium that may be accessed by one or more persons, if the distribution or posting creates any of the conditions enumerated in the definition of Bullying.
Hostile environment is a situation in which bullying causes the school environment to be permeated with intimidation, ridicule, or insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of a student's education.
Retaliation is any form of intimidation, reprisal, or harassment directed against a student who reports bullying, provides information during an investigation of bullying or witnesses or has reliable information about bullying.
Target is a student against whom bullying, cyber-bullying or retaliation has been perpetrated.
Aggressor is a student who engages in Bullying or Retaliation.
Plan is a Bullying prevention and intervention plan established by a school.
School Grounds is property on which a school building or facility is located or property that is owned, leased or used by a school for a school-sponsored activity, function, program, instruction or training.
Staff includes, but is not limited to, educators, faculty, administrators, counselors, school nurses, cafeteria workers, custodians, bus drivers, athletic coaches, advisors to extracurricular activities, support staff, and paraprofessionals.
Legal Definitions and School Policy
Austin Preparatory School may apply more stringent penalties than required by law concerning disrespectful behavior towards other members of the community. For example although the legal definition of bullying is a repeated action, Austin reserves the right to apply penalties to a student who uses a single act of written, verbal, or electronic expression or a physical act or gesture or any combination thereof that harms a Target in any way.
III. Prevention of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying
Central to the Catholic educational tradition is the belief that parents are the primary educators of their children. Parents play a major role in dealing with cases of bullying, since students turn to their parents first to discuss situations of bullying whether for themselves or for friends. Parents are critical in assuring that their children develop the skills they need to stand up for themselves and the way to discern when they have reached the limits of their abilities and need to ask for help. Austin Preparatory School will partner with parents to more effectively prevent and respond to Bullying, Cyber-Bullying and Retaliation. We propose to help educate our parents in various ways including sharing stories of personal experiences with Bullying, Cyber Bullying or Retaliation and using case studies to get parents to recognize skills both they and their children need. The School will also engage and collaborate with students' families by providing resources to families and by communicating regularly with them. There will be a Bullying and Safety section in each of the monthly e newsletters, which the school sends to parents at the beginning of the week of the monthly Parent Partnership meeting. School administrators and parents will then discuss the articles dealing with Bullying and ways to create a positive, safe culture both at school and at home, at the Parent Partnership meeting. This e newsletter Bullying section could include tips for students, tips for parents, sharing of data compiled about bullying at the School, and any social competency curricula used by the School. Discussions could include reflecting on interactions within the family, effective cyber oversight at home, and the role of parents in the 21st century. Notes from these meetings will be posted on the school website for all parents to see. Each year the School will inform parents or guardians of enrolled students about the Bullying prevention and intervention curricula used by the School including how parents and guardians can reinforce the curricula at home and support the School Plan; the dynamics of Bullying; and online safety and Cyber-Bullying. In addition the School will include the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan and the School's Internet Safety Policy in the Parent/Student Handbook and will post it on the school website. The School will review the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan and the School's Internet Safety Policy with each class during Orientation before the beginning of the school year. The Guidance Department will educate students about Bullying, Cyber-Bullying and Retaliation in Grades 6-9 during Group Guidance sessions. The Guidance Department also provides a suicide seminar to Seniors, which also stresses healthy behavior.
Bullying prevention curricula will be implemented at each grade level and will be informed by current research which emphasizes empowering students to take action by knowing what to do when they witness other students engaged in acts of bullying or retaliation, including seeking adult assistance; using scripts and role plays to develop skills; helping students understand the dynamics of bullying and cyber-bullying, including the underlying power imbalance; emphasizing cyber-safety, including safe and appropriate use of electronic communication technologies; using reading materials and discussion in religion classes; enhancing students' skills for engaging in healthy relationships and respectful communications; and engaging students in a safe, supportive school environment that is respectful of diversity and difference.
The School will provide the community with websites and literature to encourage all to be aware of the issue of bullying in school and online. The School will provide annual training on the Plan for all School Staff, and volunteers who have significant contact with students. The annual training will include Staff duties under the Plan, an overview of the steps that the Headmaster or his or her designee will follow upon receipt of a report of Bullying or Retaliation, and an overview of any Bullying prevention curricula to be offered at the School. The School will require staff members hired after the start of the school year to participate in School-based training during the school year in which they are hired, unless they can demonstrate participation in an acceptable and comparable program within the last two years.
At the beginning of each school year the Headmaster or his or her designee shall provide written notice to the School Staff of the Plan. Relevant sections of the Plan relating to the duties of School Staff shall be included in the School Employee Handbook.
The goal of professional development is to establish a common understanding of tools necessary for Staff to create a School climate that promotes safety, civil communication, and respect for differences. Professional development will build the skills of Staff members to prevent, identify, and respond to Bullying. Professional development may be informed by research and may include information on developmentally (or age-) appropriate strategies to prevent Bullying; developmentally (or age-) appropriate strategies for immediate, effective interventions to stop Bullying incidents; information regarding the complex interaction and power differential that can take place between and among an Aggressor, Target, and witnesses to the Bullying; research findings on Bullying, including information about specific categories of students who have been shown to be particularly at risk for Bullying in the School environment; information on the incidence and nature of Cyber-Bullying; and Internet safety issues as they relate to Cyber-Bullying.
Professional development will also address ways to prevent and respond to Bullying or Retaliation for students with disabilities with a particular focus on the needs of students with autism or students whose disability affects social skills development. Outside resources will be used for this professional development.
Additional areas identified by the School for professional development include promoting and modeling the use of respectful language; fostering an understanding of and respect for diversity and difference; building relationships and communicating with families; constructively managing classroom behaviors; using positive behavioral intervention strategies; applying constructive disciplinary practices; teaching students skills including positive communication, anger management, and empathy for others; engaging students in School or classroom planning and decision-making; and maintaining a safe and caring classroom for all students where even gateway behaviors are not tolerated.
The School is also committed to collecting and analyzing data that may help us better prevent and deal with Bullying. Disciplinary Referrals will provide useful data, as will student and parent surveys to determine where, how much and when bullying occurs, what types of students bully, what forms of bullying occur and what types of students are most vulnerable to bullying.
IV. Reports of Bullying, Cyber-bullying and Retaliation
There will be a clear mechanism for reporting Bullying, Cyber-bullying and Retaliation, and the Aggressor and the Target will be dealt with justly. The School will notify the parents of both parties, develop a safety plan, promptly begin an investigation, make a determination, take disciplinary action if necessary and continue to monitor the students involved to ensure their well-being.
Reports of Bullying or Retaliation may be made by Staff, students, parents or guardians, or others, and may be oral or written. Oral reports made by or to a Staff member shall be recorded in writing. A School Staff member is required to report immediately to the Headmaster or designee any instance of Bullying or Retaliation the Staff member becomes aware of or witnesses. Students may report instances of Bullying or Retaliation to any trusted adult in the community. For example they may report to the Assistant Headmaster for Student Life, the Campus Minister, the School Nurse, any Guidance Counselor or any teacher. Although the School discourages anonymous reporting, there will be a means for students to report bullying but remain anonymous. The School will make a variety of reporting resources available to the School community including, but not limited to, an Incident Reporting Form.
The School will: 1) include a copy of the Incident Reporting Form in the beginning of the year packets for students and parents or guardians; 2) make it available in the School's main office, the counseling office, the School nurse's office, and other locations determined by the Headmaster or designee; and 3) post it on the School's website. Students, parents or guardians, and others may request assistance from a Staff member to complete the written report. Use of an Incident Reporting Form is not required as a condition of making a report.
At the beginning of each School year, the School will provide the School community, including administrators, Staff, students, and parents or guardians, with written notice of its policies for reporting acts of Bullying and Retaliation. A description of the reporting procedures and resources, including the name and contact information of the Headmaster or designee, will be incorporated in student and Staff handbooks, on the School website, and in information about the Plan that is made available to parents or guardians.
Reporting by Staff
A Staff member will report immediately to the Headmaster or designee when he/she witnesses or becomes aware of conduct that may be Bullying or Retaliation. The requirement to report to the Headmaster or designee does not limit the authority of the Staff member to respond to behavioral or disciplinary incidents consistent with School policies and procedures for behavior management and discipline.
Reporting by Students, Parents or Guardians, and Others
The School expects students, parents or guardians, and others who witness or become aware of an instance of Bullying or Retaliation involving a student to report it to the Headmaster or designee. Students will be provided practical, safe, private and age-appropriate ways to respond and discuss an incident that may be Bullying or Retaliation with teachers and staff as well as with the Headmaster or designee.
Reports may be made anonymously (third party), but no disciplinary action will be taken against an alleged Aggressor solely on the basis of an anonymous report.
Throughout the entire reporting and investigatory process the School will use the official Austin Preparatory School Bullying Prevention and Intervention Incident Reporting Form that is an addendum to this document.
V. Responding to a Report of Bullying, Cyber-bullying or Retaliation
Before fully investigating the allegations of Bullying or Retaliation, the Headmaster or designee will take steps to assess the need to restore a sense of safety to the alleged Target and/or to protect the alleged Target from possible further incidents. Responses to promote safety may include, but not be limited to, creating a personal safety plan; pre-determining seating arrangements for the Target and/or the Aggressor in the classroom, at lunch, or on a bus; identifying a Staff member who will act as a "safe person" for the Target; checking in regularly with a Guidance Counselor; and altering the Aggressor's schedule and access to the Target. The Headmaster or designee will take additional steps to promote safety during the course of and after the investigation, as necessary.
The Headmaster or designee will implement appropriate strategies for protecting from Bullying or Retaliation a student who has reported Bullying or Retaliation, a student who has witnessed Bullying or Retaliation, a student who provides information during an investigation, or a student who has reliable information about a reported act of Bullying or Retaliation.
Obligation to Notify Parents
Upon determining that Bullying or Retaliation has occurred, the Headmaster or designee will promptly notify the parents or guardians of the Target and the Aggressor of this, and of the procedures for responding to it. There may be circumstances in which the Headmaster or designee contacts parents or guardians prior to any investigation.
If the reported incident involves students from more than one School district, the Headmaster or designee first informed of the incident will promptly notify by telephone the Principal or designee of the other School(s) of the incident so that each School may take appropriate action. All communications will be in accordance with state and federal privacy laws and regulations.
Upon receiving a report of Bullying or Retaliation, including after an investigation, if the Headmaster or designee has a reasonable basis to believe that criminal charges (harassment, credible threats or other) may be pursued against the Aggressor, the Headmaster will consult with the Reading School Resource Officer and other individuals the Headmaster or designee deems appropriate (including, but not limited to, the Office of the General Counsel of the Archdiocese), who will advise the School as to the appropriate response.
If an incident occurs on School grounds and involves a former student under the age of 21 who is no longer enrolled in School, the Headmaster or designee shall contact the local law enforcement agency if he or she has a reasonable basis to believe that criminal charges may be pursued against the Aggressor.
The Headmaster or designee will investigate promptly all reports of Bullying or Retaliation and, in doing so, will consider all available information known, including the nature of the allegation(s) and the ages of the students involved.
During the investigation the Headmaster or designee will, among other things, interview students, Staff, witnesses, parents or guardians, and others as necessary. The Headmaster or designee (or whoever is conducting the investigation) will remind the alleged Aggressor, Target, and witnesses that Retaliation is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.
Interviews may be conducted by the Headmaster or designee, other Staff members as determined by the Headmaster or designee, and in consultation with the School counselor, as appropriate. To the extent practicable, and given his/her obligation to investigate and address the matter, the Headmaster or designee will maintain confidentiality during the investigative process. The Headmaster or designee will maintain a written record of the investigation and will also check to see if there are any prior incidents by the Aggressor, and if so if the previous incidents involved the Target.
Procedures for investigating reports of Bullying and Retaliation will be consistent with School policies and procedures for investigations. If necessary, the Headmaster or designee will consult with the Office of the General Counsel of the Archdiocese about the investigation.
Resolution, Notification and Follow-up
The Headmaster or designee will make a determination based upon all of the facts and circumstances. If, after investigation, Bullying or Retaliation is substantiated, the law requires that the School use a range of responses that balance the need for accountability with the need to teach appropriate behavior. The Headmaster or designee will take steps reasonably calculated to prevent recurrence and to ensure that the Target is not restricted in participating in School or in benefiting from School activities. The Headmaster or designee will: 1) determine what remedial action is required, if any, and 2) determine what responsive actions and/or disciplinary action is necessary. The Assistant Headmaster for Student Life will submit a disciplinary referral form which the student and his/her parents will sign and which will be placed in the student's file.
Depending upon the circumstances, the Headmaster or designee may choose to consult with the Target's or Aggressor's teachers and/or School counselor, and the Target's or Aggressor's parents or guardians, to identify any underlying social or emotional issue(s) that may have contributed to the Bullying behavior and to assess the level of need for additional social skills development. The Headmaster or designee will notify the Target's and/or Aggressor's teachers if the student(s) still needs special support.
The Headmaster or designee will promptly notify the parents or guardians of the Target and the Aggressor about the results of the investigation and, if Bullying or Retaliation is found, what action is being taken to prevent further acts of Bullying or Retaliation. All notice to parents must comply with applicable Massachusetts and federal privacy laws and regulations. Because of the legal requirements regarding the confidentiality of student records, the Headmaster or designee cannot report specific information to the Target's parent or guardian about the disciplinary action taken unless it involves a "stay away" order or other directive that the Target must be aware of in order to report violations.
Taking Disciplinary Action
If the Headmaster or designee decides that disciplinary action is appropriate, the disciplinary action will be determined on the basis of facts found by the Headmaster or designee, including the nature of the conduct, the age of the student(s) involved, and the need to balance accountability with the teaching of appropriate behavior. Discipline will be consistent with the Plan and with the School's code of conduct and may include an in-school suspension, social probation or regular suspension. The Aggressor and his/her parents will be asked to sign a written behavior contract, which may include weekly meetings with a designated staff person and referral for outside counseling as needed.
If the Principal or designee determines that a student knowingly made a false allegation of Bullying or Retaliation, that student may be subject to disciplinary action.
If a suspension is involved the suspended student and his/her parents must meet with the Asst. Head for Student Life and the student's Guidance Counselor before returning to school. At that meeting the suspended student will be coached in how to reintegrate into the community.
Promoting Safety for the Target and Others
The Headmaster or designee will consider what adjustments, if any, are needed in the School environment to enhance the Target's sense of safety and that of others as well. One strategy that the Headmaster or designee may use is to increase adult supervision at transition times and in locations where Bullying is known to have occurred or is likely to occur. The safety plan may also include meeting weekly with a trusted adult in the community.
Within a reasonable period of time such as one week following the determination and the ordering of remedial and/or disciplinary action, the Headmaster or designee will contact the Target to determine whether there has been a recurrence of the prohibited conduct and whether additional supportive measures are needed. If so, the Headmaster or designee will work with appropriate School Staff to implement them immediately.
Access to Resources and Services
In order to promote a positive School climate and to enhance its capacity to prevent, intervene early, and respond effectively to Bullying, the School is committed to ensuring that the underlying emotional needs of Targets, Aggressors, families, and others are addressed. To this end the School will provide counseling or referral to appropriate services for Aggressors, Targets, and family members of those students.
The School's Guidance Counselors will provide counseling and support and help develop safety plans for students who have been targets of Bullying or Retaliation as well as provide social skills programs to prevent Bullying and education and/or intervention services for students exhibiting Bullying behaviors. Skill-building approaches may include individualized skill-building sessions based on the School's anti-Bullying curricula; relevant educational activities for individual students or groups of students, in consultation with guidance counselors and other appropriate School personnel; a range of academic and nonacademic positive behavioral supports to help students understand pro-social ways to achieve their goals; meetings with parents and guardians to engage parental support and to reinforce the anti-Bullying curricula and social skills building activities at home; behavioral plans to include a focus on developing specific social skills; and making a referral for evaluation.
When the School determines that an outside professional referral is necessary it will immediately communicate this determination to the student's family in order to help students and families access appropriate and timely services and to comply with relevant laws and policies. The school will encourage families to consult their daughter's or son's medical doctor. Local police, the county Attorney General's office, the Archdiocese of Boston and the MA Department of Education may offer services as well.
VI. Conclusion
This plan is meant to prevent Bullying, Cyber-bullying and Retaliation at Austin Preparatory School by providing student, parent and staff education and effective means of reporting incidents of Bullying, Cyber-bullying and Retaliation that do occur and by clearly outlining the school's procedure for responding to such reports and the consequences for such actions.
