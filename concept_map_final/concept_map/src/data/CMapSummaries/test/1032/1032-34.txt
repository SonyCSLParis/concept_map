Understanding General Anxiety Disorder in Children
It's strange to think of children suffering from anxiety. Why would they? Their lives are carefree, unencumbered by adult concerns. Unfortunately kids can suffer from general anxiety disorder, just like adults. And research is suggesting that it's an inheritable trait. IE if a parent suffers from anxiety, so will their offspring.
Start by identifying if your child is suffering from attacks. Sometimes a child will have be anxious over an issue but gets over it relatively quickly. Provided there's no repeat to the behavior, chances are good that it's not a sign of the disorder. True suffering from anxiety manifests itself over a period of time. Keep an eye out for repetitive symptoms, such as stomach aches, phantom illnesses, and a general sense of insecurity. GAD creates physical symptoms that have no connection to an actual cause.
Once it's determined that the physical problems are from GAD, it's time to root out the cause. A sufferer will internalize the problem and not really talk about it. So the parent may have a more difficult time finding the source. Be persistent, draw out the child, and get them to discuss the problem. Sometimes it's a change at school or some form of peer pressure. Other times it may be a bit more obvious such as a move.
It's at this point where the parent needs to make the decision to send the child into therapy and/or medicate. GAD will follow the child into adulthood so it may not be a bad idea to address the problem sooner than later. Probably the most effective form of therapy may be cognitive. It encourages the child to discuss their feelings and how to work through them in a non-confrontational way.
It's not a good idea to ignore the signs of GAD. Letting it go untreated can cause problems for the child down the road.
