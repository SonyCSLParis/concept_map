Anxiety in Children
Anxiety in Children
Kids and teens suffer from anxiety and stress in amounts that rival that which is suffered by adults. There are many triggers of this anxiety including parents who are dealing with their own stresses and are neglecting their kids, dealing with the pressure of getting good grades in school or other activities, being abused, and suffering from deprivation. It is not easy to grow up, especially for kids who are required to take on more than they should be. Parents who are unable to cope with their own stress and anxiety can often unknowingly trigger these disorders in their kids.
The symptoms of anxiety in kids range from shyness to aggression and they may not be interested in doing activities that are normally very popular with kids. Studies indicate that kids who have to grow up quickly often rebel against their parents and their rules. They can also choose to rebel against society and its rules as well. These kids often manifest their stress through aggression and becoming defensive. In addition, it becomes a vicious circle because the more they withdraw from society the more society wants to keep them at bay, which leads to anxiety.
Teens that decide to go against the conventions of society can develop depression as a result of these childhood anxieties. But, stress can also lead to phobias and anxiety which can cause the children to perform poorly in a variety of situations.
How to Alleviate Stress in Children
1. Hold discussions with your kids. Do not be oblivious to what is going on in their lives. Do not lie to them and allow them to ask questions. They can also choose to write their problems in a journal. Help them learn how to use various coping skills and how to use them in different circumstances.
2. Do not talk about your problems with your kids. However, you can talk about what you would like the family to achieve and talk about issues that they do need to know about in a pleasant way.
3. Praise your kids when they accomplish something and be sure to hug and kiss them often.
4. Find the humor in problematic situation to ease the tension. This will help your kids develop their senses of humor as a coping skill when things get tough in the future.
5. Allow your kids to be kids. Do not overschedule them with activities and chores. Teach them how to do things in moderation. Do not sign them up for every single activity that is presented to you. Do not put pressure on them to come in first in every activity they try.
6. Model good coping skills. Exercise self-control when situations get tense. Your kids will practice what they see, so you want them to see you handling stressful circumstances in a calm way.
7. If you can't handle the stress and anxiety issues your children are dealing with, talk to a friend or expert to help you out.
