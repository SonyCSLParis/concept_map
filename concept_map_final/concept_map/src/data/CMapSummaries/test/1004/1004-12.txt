It may come as a shock to some, but depression among school-aged children is becoming increasingly commonplace. Approximately 10% of adolescents (2.2 million) experienced at least one major period of depression in the past year. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of children and adolescents suffering from depression also had another mental health disorder such as an anxiety disorder or a substance abuse disorder. Finally, children and adolescents with major depressive disorder are much more likely to commit suicide. Simply put, depression in school-aged children is real and it's a serious problem that all too often goes unnoticed.
I am often asked, "How do I know if my child is depressed?" That's a simple question but the answer is more complicated. A lot of children and adolescents experience some of the symptoms of depression. For example, most kids eventually lose interest in some of their hobbies. That's part of the maturation process. What is important is why this change is taking place. Is it because they are exploring new interests or is the change accompanied by a general sense of sadness and hopelessness? It's those types of subtle distinctions that are important when examining issues related to depression.
With that in mind, these are the most common symptoms of major depression.
feeling worthless, anxious, empty, irritated, and/or hopeless
loss of interest in activities, hobbies, or relationships
reduced pleasure in daily activities
inability to enjoy activities which used to be sources of pleasure
change in appetite, usually a loss of appetite but sometimes an increase
change in weight (unintentional weight loss or gain)
persistent difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia)
difficulty concentrating or making decisions
acting-out behavior (missing curfews, unusual defiance)
If parents suspect their son or daughter may be suffering from depression, it's a good idea to see their family doctor for a check up. There are times when a child has a physical condition that is the source of the problem. Ultimately, I recommend that parents seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can conduct a proper assessment of the child. This is too important of an issue to simply hope things get better. Also, most schools have some type of mental health professional who can provide information or an appropriate referral.
Here are a few practical suggestions that parents can implement on their own. Increasing evidence suggests that exercise is an effective part of the treatment for depression. The key to exercise as a depression reliever is in a brain chemical called phenylethylamine, or PEA which is a natural stimulant produced by the body. People who are depressed are low in PEA and exercise raises these levels. Develop a family plan to ensure you're getting enough exercise to stay healthy.
Make an effort to keep your son or daughter busy and engaged in life. The natural response to depression is to withdraw from life, which is the worst thing to do. Parents need to help keep kids actively engaged in life but that's often easier said than done.
Last, but not least act. If your child was badly hurt and bleeding, you'd take him or her to a doctor. Well, a child might be hurting on the inside where you can't see it. Seek information and get help for your child because all too often, depression in children and adolescents is a silent killer.
