CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS
Depressive disorders come in different forms, just as in the case with other illnesses such as severity, and persistence.
Major depression is manifested by a combination of symptoms that interfere with the ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy once pleasurable activities. Such a disabling episode of depression may occur only once but more commonly occurs several times in a lifetime.
Dysthymia. A less severe type of depression, dysthymia, involves long-term, chronic symptoms that are not disabling, but keep one from functioning well or from feeling good. Many people with dysthymia also experience major depressive episodes at some time in their lives.
Bipolar disorder. Another type of depression is bipolar disorder, also called manic-depressive illness. Not nearly as prevalent as other forms of depressive disorders, bipolar disorder is characterized by cycles or episodes of mood changes: severe highs (mania) and lows (depression). Sometimes the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual. When in the depressed episode, an individual can have any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder. When in the manic episode, the individual may be overactive, over talkative, and have a great deal of energy. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, the individual in a manic phase may feel elated, full of grand schemes. Mania, left untreated, may worsen to what is called psychosis, or the loss of touch with reality and associated hallucinations or delusions.
SYMPTOMS OF CHILD DEPRESSION
Depressive illness in children and adolescents includes a group of symptoms which have persisted for at least two weeks, including several of the following:
Significant change of appetite
Change in sleeping patterns (such as trouble falling asleep, waking up in the middle of the night, early morning awakening, or sleeping too much)
Loss of interest in activities formerly enjoyed
Loss of energy, fatigue, feeling slowed down for no reason, "burned out"
Feelings of guilt and self blame for things that are not one's fault
Inability to concentrate and indecisiveness
Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness
Recurring thought of death and suicide, wishing to die, or attempting suicide
Children and adolescents with depression may also have vague, non-specific physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, etc.). There is a greater likelihood of depressive illness in the children of parents with significant depression.
In children, depressive symptoms may be less noticeable by their parents, teachers and others, since children may not be able to express their feelings in the same way as adults. So for them, symptoms may be evidenced by changes in the following:
grades or attendance at school
relationships with your family and friends
alcohol, drugs, or sex
The good news is that you can get treatment and feel better soon. Approximately 4% of adolescents get seriously depressed each year. Clinical Depression is a serious illness that can affect anybody. It can affect thoughts, feelings, behavior, and overall health.
Most people with depression can be helped with treatment. But a majority of depressed children and adolescents never get the help they need. And, when depression isn't treated, it can get worse, last longer, and prevent this youngster from getting the most out of this important time in life.
Myths about depression often prevent people from doing the right thing. Some common myths are
MYTH: It's normal for teenagers to be moody; Teens don't suffer from "real" depression.
FACT: Depression is more than just being moody. And it can affect people at any age, including teenagers.
MYTH: Telling an adult that a friend might be depressed is betraying a trust. If someone wants help, he or she will get it.
FACT: Depression, which saps energy and self-esteem, interferes with a person's ability or wish to get help. It is an act of true friendship to share your concerns with an adult who can help.
MYTH: Talking about depression only makes it worse.
FACT: Talking through feelings with a good friend is often a helpful first step. Friendship, concern, and support can provide the encouragement to talk to a parent or other trusted adult about getting evaluated for depression.
WHAT CAUSES DEPRESSION?
Genetic. Some types of depression, such as bipolar disorder or early onset depressive disorder, run in families, suggesting that a vulnerability to developing depression can be inherited. For example, studies of families in which members of each generation develop bipolar disorder found that those with the illness have a somewhat different genetic makeup than those who do not get ill. However, not everyone with the genetic makeup that causes vulnerability to depression will develop the illness. Quite possibly, additional factors such as trauma, loss of a loved one, early perinatal difficulties, or stresses at school or home may involved in its onset.
In some families, major depression also seems to occur generation after generation. However, it can also occur in people who have no family history of depression. Whether inherited or not, major depressive disorder is often associated with changes in brain structures or brain function.
Physical Health. In recent years, researchers have shown that physical changes in the body can be accompanied by mental changes as well. Medical illnesses such as stroke, a heart attack, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and hormonal disorders can cause depressive illness, making the sick person apathetic and unwilling to care for his or her physical needs, thus prolonging the recovery period. Also, a serious loss, difficult relationship, financial problem, or any stressful (unwelcome or even desired) change in life patterns can trigger a depressive episode. Very often, a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors is involved in the onset of a depressive disorder.
Emotion/Personality. People who have low self-esteem, who consistently view themselves and the world with pessimism or who are readily overwhelmed by stress, are prone to depression. Whether this represents a psychological predisposition or an early form of the illness is not clear.
DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN
Only in the past two decades has depression in children been taken very seriously. The depressed child may pretend to be sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent, or worry that the parent may die. Older children may sulk, get into trouble at school, be negative, grouchy, and feel misunderstood. Because normal behaviors vary from one childhood stage to another, it can be difficult to tell whether a child is just going through a temporary "phase" or is suffering from depression. Sometimes the parents become worried about how the child's behavior has changed, or a teacher notices a change in behavior. In such a case, a visit to the child's pediatrician is in order.
One of the critical elements in establishing a diagnosis of depression is through the assistance of rating scales. Some rating scales actually list all of the key symptoms of depression, for completion by either a youth directly, or by someone that knows the child well, such as a parent or teacher. A score on a depression rating scale, whether it is high or low, does not "prove" that the child or youth does or does not have the clinical diagnosis of depression: persons filling out the scale may misunderstand the question, incorrectly endorse or deny symptoms. But these scales are often about 75=85% accurate, so that can be a useful guide for clinicians during a diagnostic work-up, as well as after the diagnosis has been established, where they can be used to monitor response to treatment.
Because these tools can be help, REACH Institute's President Peter S. Jensen, M.D., led a US - Canadian Steering Committee consisting of pediatricians, family physicians, child psychiatrists, psychologists, researchers, and policy makers to put together a comprehensive set of recommendations to guide primary care clinicians through the essential steps in diagnosing and treating youth depression. This program is called "GLAD-PC" - Guidelines for Adolescent Depression - Primary Care , resulted in two key papers authored by the GLAD-PC Steering Committee , as well as a user-friendly toolkit that includes depression rating scales in the public domain and free for download and use.  If you want to learn more about GLAD-PC and download the GLAD-PC toolkit and accompanying rating scales, follow the GLAD-PC link.
Certain medications as well as some medical conditions such as a viral infection can cause the same symptoms as depression, and the physician should rule out these possibilities through examination, interview, and lab tests. If a physical cause for the depression is ruled out, a psychiatric and psychological evaluation should be done, usually by a child psychiatrist, general psychiatrist or psychologist.
A good diagnostic evaluation will include a complete history of symptoms, i.e., when they started, how long they have lasted, how severe they are, whether the patient had them before and, if so, whether the symptoms were treated and what treatment was given. The doctor should ask about alcohol and drug use, and if the patient has thoughts about death or suicide. Further, a history should include questions about whether other family members have had a depressive illness and, if treated, what treatments they may have received and which were effective.
Last, a diagnostic evaluation should include a "mental status examination" to determine if speech or thought patterns or memory have been affected, as sometimes happens in the case of a depressive or manic-depressive illness.
If treatment is needed, the doctor may suggest that a therapist, social worker or psychologist provide therapy while the psychiatrist will oversee medication if it is needed. Parents should not be afraid to ask questions: What are the therapist's qualifications? What kind of therapy will the child have? Will the family as a whole participate in therapy? Will the child's therapy include an antidepressant? If so, what might the side effects be?
