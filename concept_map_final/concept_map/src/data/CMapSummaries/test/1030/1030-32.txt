It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that corporal punishment should be legally prohibited in all states and that alternative forms of student behavior management e utilized in the school setting.
By definition, corporal punishment is the intentional infliction of physical pain as a method of changing behavior (NASP, 2006). Historically corporal punishment has been used to discipline school students although physical punishment is currently prohibited in public schools in 29 states, including many school districts in many major American cities (Gershoff, 2008; National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools [NCACPS], 2008; United State Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2009).The American Academy of Pediatrics (2006), the National Parent Teacher Association (2010), the National Association of School Psychologists (2006), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2007) are among groups that have taken a position recommending the abolishment of corporal punishment.
DESCRIPTION OF ISSUE
Corporal punishment adversely affects students' self-image and school achievement, can contribute to disruptive behaviors, can result in physical harm, inhibits the development of appropriate social skills, and also promotes the message that violence is an acceptable mode of behavior in our schools (National Association of School Psychologists [NASP], 2006).
There is little research that supports the premise that physical punishment will change the behavior of children and youth. The school nurse, as an advocate for the health and well-being of students, must take the position that corporal punishment places students at risk for negative outcomes, including increased aggression, antisocial behavior, mental health problems and physical injury (Gershoff, 2008). A multi-faceted approach to student behavior management is needed including strategies that support parents and teachers, and strategies that alter the school or classroom environments (NASP, 2006).
