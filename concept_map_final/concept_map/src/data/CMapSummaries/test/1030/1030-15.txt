4430 CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND REASONABLE FORCE
From Alamance-Burlington School Board Policies
Believing that other forms of discipline are more appropriate with children of all ages, the Alamance-Burlington Board of Education prohibits the use of corporal punishment. No principal, assistant principal, teacher, substitute teacher, any other school system employee, or volunteer may use corporal punishment to discipline any student.
A. Corporal punishment is all forms of physical punishment including, but not limited to, spanking, paddling, or slapping.
B. School personnel may use reasonable force to control behavior or to remove a person from the scene in those situations when necessary: 1. To correct students; 2. To quell a disturbance threatening injury to others. 3. To obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects on the person, or within the control, of a student. 4. For self-defense. 5. For the protection of persons or property. 6. To maintain order on school property, in the classroom, or at a school-related activity on or off school property.
Use of reasonable force consistent with Section B of this policy is not considered corporal punishment. School personnel may use physical restraint only in accordance with Board Policy 4800.
