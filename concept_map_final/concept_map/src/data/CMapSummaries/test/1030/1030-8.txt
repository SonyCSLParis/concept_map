Policies and Regulations
School Board of the City of Virginia Beach Policy 5-35
Discipline and Corporal/Academic/Group Punishment/Detention
Control of Students
The discipline and control of students shall be the responsibility of the principal, the administrators, and the teachers. The supervision and control of students should be maintained during the period while the student is in school, participating in extra-curricular or school sponsored activities, and while he/she is going to or coming from school.
Corporal Punishment
The Superintendent shall see that all employees of the School Board adhere to the Code of Virginia, ยง 22.1-279.1, Corporal punishment prohibited as cited in the legal reference to this policy.
Employees shall also be informed that the School Board demands compliance with both the word and intent of the law.
Academic Punishment
Academic punishment, which is defined as reducing credit previously earned, shall not be used. A student's academic grade shall be based solely on his/her achievement. Other types of discipline rather than an arbitrary reduction in credit earned should be employed when punishment is necessary.
This statement should not be interpreted to preclude a student's average grade being lowered by his/her failure to do assigned work. A student cannot be given credit for work not done such as may occur when he/she fails to do assigned work or when he/she had an unexcused absence from class resulting in his/her not having the privilege of making up missed work. The teacher will not penalize the student beyond the period of the unexcused absence.
Group Punishment
The use of group punishment in the school division is not endorsed by the School Board and its use is strongly discouraged.
The adult student, parent or legal guardian will be notified in advance of the detention. Students in detention must be attended by a teacher, administrator, or teacher assistant. Students may be detained before or after school hours for up to one hour.
