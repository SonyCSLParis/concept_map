National Center for Family and Community Connections with Schools SEDL's National Center for Family and Community Connections with Schools links people with research-based information and resources that they can use to effectively connect schools, families, and communities. National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education is an advocate for the involvement of parents and families in their children's education and seeks to make a difference by serving as visible representative, conducting activities that involve organizations efforts in family participation and providing resource and legislative information. Parents for Public Schools Parents for Public Schools offers a network for parents to engage in school improvement efforts at the local, state and national levels and works to develop parent leadership by arming parents with information about how schools should and do operate and motivation to act on behalf of all the students.
Alcohol causes several cardiovascular complications and is responsible for about 15% of all cases of hypertension and most of the cases of cardiomyopathy. Individuals in DTs can also be paranoid. 4 Based on a child-centered definition of children of alcoholics (COA), the Children of Alcoholics Foundation defines alcohol dependence as the child's perception that a parent drinks too much and that drinking interferes with the child's life.

Such long-term analyses have been conducted for several programs, demonstrating that some result in long-term reductions of tobacco and marijuana use, but not alcohol use, among adolescents (Ellickson et al. 1993; Pentz et al. 1989; Johnson et al. 1990).
[75] Parental substance use has also been indicated as a risk factor for child substance use. [88] In addition to knowledge about the etiology of drug use, prevention research also results in a greater understanding of how to encourage program participation, why programs are more or less effective, and what insights into the processes that occur through intervention can have positive or negative effects on outcome. The prevalence of cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use for the students who received the Life Skills Training program was 44 percent lower than for control students, and the weekly use of multiple drugs was 66 percent lower.
A September 2005 strategy guide from the National Center for Family and Community Connections with Schools aims to help bridge the school-family gap with suggestions on how to foster communication, create an inviting atmosphere for families, and use different cultural values to a school's advantage by building on them to connect with families. Description: Studies show that teens who don't have specific plans during summer break may be at a higher risk of using alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs.

Programs for families of troubled teens Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) is a family therapy program designed for families with youth between the ages of 6 and 17 who are exhibiting behavior problems and/or are at risk for drug abuse. An experimental evaluation of the program found that BSFT significantly reduced conduct disorders among teens whose families had received BSFT, compared to those who did not receive the program, as well as reduced drug use among 60% of the teens who had been smoking marijuana at the start of the program (Santisteban et al., 2003). In A.E.
Dr. Jacobson described the effects of low-level lead exposure and prenatal alcohol exposure on 7-year-old children. This has been a problem with other disorders, such as ADHD, but may be a particular concern with fetal alcohol exposure since many children who present with behavioral problems are adopted and their parents may not know the extent of their alcohol exposure. Whether polydrug use during pregnancy and multiple exposures have summative or synergistic effects The degree to which FAS subgroup phenotypes of cognitive behavioral profiles (subtypes) might exist within the set of all alcohol-exposed individuals, profiles that might help target laboratory research and assist in the design of intervention studies Clear communication that subtypes may not be specific to alcohol Relating the size of the corpus callosum to subtype differentiation Differentiating deficits that result directly from brain damage (core or primary deficits) from effects that result from environmental influences Comparing children of alcoholics who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol with those who have not Developing the knowledge base regarding the experiential component of developmental psychopathology Developing the knowledge base regarding the effects of postnatal experience on brain development Comparisons of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol to those prenatally exposed to cocaine (although essentially the same populations, they experience very different neurobehavioral outcomes) Comparing conduct disorders in children prenatally exposed to alcohol with conduct disorders in children not prenatally exposed to alcohol Development of possible interventions, including drugs, to counteract the effects of alcohol in pregnant women and to affect the injured neurotransmitter systems of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol.
Study 1 School Commitment and Academic Performance The results from the analyses conducted by Catalano and colleagues (2003) of the teacher data showed that students who received the RHC program had a significantly higher level of commitment to school than the students in the control condition. Antisocial Behavior The teacher data showed that students receiving the RHC program had a significantly lower level of antisocial behavior, compared with control group students, and displayed a decreasing growth rate as well. Students also received booster sessions and group workshops during the middle and high school years.
Marian Davis will head the Music Boosters as President. If a minor leaves your house and becomes injured in an accident, or without an accident, the supervising parents can be charged with breaking the law for allowing alcohol to be served. Any adult providing alcohol to a minor is subject to up to 2 years in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.
The following are areas a professional can explore with other family members to gather information about a parent's alcohol and/or other drug abuse problem: How do family members view alcohol and/or other drug use? Awareness of the Impact of Alcohol and Other Drug Use on the Child It is important to assess parents' understanding of the relationship between their substance abuse and their children's care. To ensure that infants and children receive appropriate care from relatives and that services will be provided to relatives that will support them in the care of the children, it is essential that professionals assess the relatives' abilities and vulnerabilities in the areas of parenting skills and history of abuse, neglect or violence; alcohol and/or other drug use; quality of the relationship with the parent and ability to protect and nurture the child; and cooperation, receptivity, and access to services.
I don't even have prescriptions in my home so I never even thought about those drugs.Remember, you can't be a buddy right now to your teens, we have to be a parent. Comment By : Pattilou22 I am definitely for drug and alcohol testing in schools.These kids are to out of control so now its time to take away some of there privileges.Some kids are feared for retaliation.Parents try to watch out for their future as not to get a record and then they may not be able to get a job, then we have them home all the time.its a vicious cycle. Comment By : cat all these situations are so in par with my son's who just turned 16 what is a parent to do, I do not believe prison to be aplace to help it only covers the situation but the abuse is still there, my son is currently in detention and I am hoping to get him some councilling I know we will fight me everystep of the way.
It is well recognized that having a parent with a substance use disorder (SUD) can have adverse effects on a child (Fisher & Wampler, 1994; Rogosch, Chassin & Sher, 1990), but research is scarce on how the family environment changes when one or both parents are in recovery; and few studies have evaluated the impact of recovery on child functioning. A prevailing notion, based on a very small group of studies with clinical samples, is that prolonged remission can positively impact child functioning and family functioning (Moos & Billings, 1982; Callan & Jackson, 1986; Andreas & O'Farrell, 2007; Andreas, O'Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006). Brown and Lewis (1999) found that for pre-teens and adolescents, the early years of recovery were often worse than the drinking years, as the family experienced the "trauma of recovery" when all of the alcoholic's energy was focused on maintaining abstinence and recovery.
It is very important that parents communicate love at appropriate times both in what they say to their children, and the non-verbal cues they use. In their book Common Sense Parenting , Burke and Herron note that clear expectations are essential for children to understand what they should do. You're a sweetheart and we love you, but you have to learn to take responsibility for what you do" (p. 53).
Recognizing the very important role that family plays in the development and decision making of students, it is important for parents/guardians to prepare their children for the inevitable opportunity to use alcohol or drugs. If your child is in a situation where they need your support, children need to know that they can count on you to come and get them, no questions asked. It is always important for parents to know where their children and teenagers are, who they are with, and to monitor their activities.
If children are born or raised in a family with a history of criminal activity the risk of juvenile delinquency increases, Similarly, children raised by a teenage mother are more likely to be teen parents, and children of dropouts are more likely to drop out. Provide positive alternatives to help youth in high risk environments develop personal and social skills ( Zibi Quest or Project Venture Menomonee ) Strengthen the bonds between adults and youth and provide opportunities for positive community involvement (Example: Across Ages ) Improve family functioning through family therapy where indicated Promote clear rules and emphasize family, personal, public and legal consequences of involvement in crime and the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs Communicate peer norms against use Family Management Problems The risk factor has been shown to increase the risk of drug abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school dropout, and violence. Provide skill based programs for youth who may be dealing with grief, loss, or divorce (Example: Children in the Middle ) Target the entire family Emphasize family bonding Employ strategies to overcome parental resistance to family-based programs Provide positive alternatives to help youth in high risk environments develop personal and social skills Promote new skills in family communication through interactive techniques Improve family functioning through family therapy where indicated Parent Attitudes and Involvement in Drug Use, Crime and Violence Parental attitudes and behavior toward drugs, crime, and violence influence the behavior of their children.
Accordingly, during young adulthood, individuals who displayed more serious antisocial behaviors in childhood tend to have greater difficulties than their peers in work; tend to abuse substances; and tend to have problems in interpersonal relationships such as marriage or parenting (Caspi, Elder, & Herbener, 1990; Farrington, 1991; Magnusson, 1992; Quinton & Rutter, 1988; Robins, 1993; Rönkä & Pulkkinen, 1995). Parent Criminality and the Antisocial Behavior of Adolescents In their meta-analysis of 34 prospective longitudinal studies of the development of antisocial behavior, Lipsey and Derzon (1998) found that having an antisocial parent or parents was one of the strongest predictors of violent or serious delinquency in adolescence and young adulthood (see Table 1). A.
Parent involvement is systematically increased with the schools, with the youth, with their own family, and with the families of other youth at the same school. They are invited to bring their whole busy family for a multi-family group opportunity which respects their role as parent leader in their own family, and offers them a chance to build relationships with other parents of children attending their child's school. The parents who "need it the most", and who "do not care about their child" are the very same parents who must not care enough about the child to come in and find out what they can do to improve their child's situation.
Alcohol: Problems and Solutions Children, Alcohol and Parenting Drinking by children is often seen as a problem, but traditional alcohol education promoting abstinence is ineffective. Simply doing more of what isn't working cannot lead to success, so what should you do as parents? 6 Instead of stigmatizing alcohol and trying to scare children into permanent abstinence, we need to recognize that it is not alcohol but rather the abuse of alcohol that is the problem .
In the present study, we examined the social communication of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and matched peers by documenting frequency of occurrence and duration of behavioral dimensions as they were observed in classroom settings. The following general question was addressed: When social communication performance is divided into six mutually exclusive dimensions (prosocial/engaged, passive/disengaged, irrelevant, hostile/coercive, assertive, and adult seeking), do two groups of children (i.e., a group diagnosed with FASD and a group of matched, typically developing peers) demonstrate different profiles of social communication in regard to frequency of occurrence and duration (proportion and average length of time) of each dimension in a classroom setting? Classroom Performance From a Dimension Perspective: Children With FASD and TD Children The observational data from this research indicate that children diagnosed with FASD and their TD matched peers spent most of their time demonstrating prosocial/engaged behaviors, followed by irrelevant and passive/disengaged performances.
Prior to coming to PRC in June 0f 2002, a five year study was undertaken to explore the relationships between maternal behaviors (specifically alcohol use, punitive and protective behaviors) and adolescents' symptoms of trauma and their alcohol use. Thus all of mothers' behaviors were related to each other. To explore further how maternal behavior may be related to other patterns of adolescent alcohol and drug use, we then explored whether maternal alcohol involvement was related to children's expectancies about alcohol use.
Another concern involves determining the possible family influences on how individuals develop problems with alcohol-there is consensus that children of alcoholic parents are at a greater risk for developing alcoholism (and other mental or behavioral health problems) than are others, but there is not complete consensus as to the specific mechanisms by which this increased risk is operationalized (Begun &amp; Zweben, 1990). The relevant risk factors include parental psychological problems, family climate, family health, family conflicts, severity of the alcohol abuse, the child's level of exposure to the alcohol abuse, and distortions or changes in family routines associated with the drinking behavior. In this framework, family is important in the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders for several reasons (McCrady, 1989; Waldron &amp; Slesnick, 1998): Their behaviors can act as stimulus cues that trigger drinking responses; Family members act as models for specific alcohol-related behaviors, as well as for more general coping strategies (e.g., observation of drinking to relieve stress); The family may influence an individual's emotional and physical reactions which are associated with vulnerability to alcohol abuse; Their responses can act to reinforce or punish efforts at sobriety, abstinence, or reduction of alcohol use Family members may interfere with the individual experiencing the negative consequences of drinking, and this shielding encourages perpetuation of the drinking.
The more extensive the parent involvement, the higher the student achievement. When parents are involved in their students' education, those students have higher grades and test scores, better attendance, and complete homework more consistently. The most accurate predictor of a student's achievement in school is not income or social status, but the extent to which that student's family is able to (1) create a home environment that encourages learning; (2) communicate high, yet reasonable, expectations for their children's achievement and future careers; and (3) become involved in their children's education at school and in the community.
What characteristics do parents with alcohol and other drug problems and parents involved in child maltreatment share? Children of alcoholics are more likely than children in the general population to suffer a variety of physical, mental, and emotional health problems. In addition to suffering from all the effects of living in a household where alcohol or child maltreatment problems exist, children whose parents abuse illicit drugs live with the knowledge that their parents' actions are illegal.
The Parent-Targeted Intervention for Adolescent Substance Use Prevention (PTI) is a prevention program that seeks to reduce tobacco and alcohol use in adolescents. Study findings at posttest and follow-up found no impacts on parenting behaviors, the onset of alcohol and/or tobacco use, or on children's reports of parenting behaviors. In Session 2, parents meet with the parents of their children's friends.
Proven Results Improves resilience, assets, and protective factors in children and parents Decreases risk factors in parents and children Decreases children's behavioral problems and conduct disorders Improves family cohesion, communication, and organization Decreases family conflict and stress (FAST) Families and Schools Together: Building Relationships (Elementary and Middle School) Families and Schools Together (FAST) is a multifamily group intervention designed to build protective factors and reduce the risk factors associated with substance abuse and related problem behaviors for children 4 to12 years old and their parents. Developed by the Mendez Foundation for use with students in kindergarten  through 12th grade (5 to 18 years old), TGFD has a separate, developmentally appropriate curriculum for each grade level, and is designed to develop: Personal and interpersonal skills relating to alcohol, tobacco and illegal drug use Appropriate attitudes toward alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use Knowledge of the negative consequences of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use and benefits of a drug-free lifestyle Positive peer norms The program's highly interactive teaching methods encourage students to bond with prosocial peers, and engages students through role-play, cooperative learning, games, small group activities and class discussions. Youth Connection reduces risk factors for substance abuse and enhances protective factors among selective populations of youth.
A. A. Intergenerational Learning: A Review of the Literature http://www.ncoff.gse.upenn.edu/litrev/iglr.htm Fact: "[B]iological fathers were more likely to physically abuse their partners than were stepfathers or other men, and... children were more likely to witness IPV if it was perpetrated by their biological father instead of a stepfather (Sullivan et al., 2000)...       "We found some support for our first hypothesis that biological fathers would be more likely than social fathers to report that they observed negative effects of IPV [on their children]... We also found support for our second hypothesis that biological fathers would be more likely to express worry about the long-term effect of their abuse on their children, particularly on female children.
These factors are: How severe the trauma is How the parents react to the trauma How close or far away the child is from the trauma Children and teens that go through the most severe traumas tend to have the highest levels of PTSD symptoms. What can you do to help? You as a parent might also get help from talking to a therapist on your own.
Action Steps for Implementing Family and Community Involvement in School Health With the enactment of the No Child Left Behind legislation, family and community partnerships with schools have become central. The more extensive the parent involvement, the higher the student achievement. Actions for Schools and School Districts Create a an environment in which parents feel valued and welcome, and that is culturally sensitive, including developing supportive mission and policy statements Outreach to encourage participation of parents who might have low-level literacy skills and/or from whom English is a second language Involve parents and other family members in planning, curriculum and policy development, and decision making related to school health Hire and train a family coordinator to act as a liaison between families and schools and coordinate family activities Disseminate information on school reforms, policies, discipline procedures, assessment tools, and school goals, and include parents in any related decision-making process Link parents to programs and resources within the community that provide support services to families, i.e., create an information and resource center to support families with training, resources, and other services; collaborate with community agencies to provide family support services and adult learning opportunities Meet with parents at least twice a year, accommodating the varied schedules of parents, language barriers, and the need for child care Encourage immediate contact between parents, teachers, principles, and other administrative staff when concerns arise Communicate with parents regarding positive student behavior and achievement, not just regarding misbehavior or failure Use creative forms of communication with families that make optimal use of new communication technologies Encourage parents and students to volunteer and provide ample training on volunteer procedures and school protocol Ensure that parents who are unable to volunteer in the school building are given the options for helping other ways Enlist community volunteers such as civic groups, service clubs, religious groups, seniors groups, and law enforcement Develop partnerships with local businesses and services groups to advance student learning and assist schools and families Survey parents regarding their interests, talents and availability, then coordinate the parent resources with those that exist within the school and among the faculty Actions for Families and Students Encourage children's healthy behaviors by praising appropriate behaviors and acting as positive role models Cooperate with schools and others in the community to provide for children's physical and mental health services Learn about and reinforce the skills and messages in children's health and physical education curricula and, if they are uncomfortable with a message, discuss their concerns with school decision makers Communicate with teachers and administrative staff regarding the childs progress and behavior Use community resources that provide opportunities for children and other family members to engage in positive social and learning experiences Participate in any parenting skill courses that my be offered by the school and/or community Participate in all decision-making regarding school polices Volunteer in the childs school by joining the PTA, other parent organization, or parent advisory committee Vote in school board elections Advocate for better CSHP standards and funding at the local and state levels Determine what components of a CSHP exist in the school, and work with the school and others in the community to strengthen weak components or establish those that are missing Distribute notices and handouts at markets, clinics, community centers, and religious institutions to inform families and other community members about health issues and to garner broader community support Actions for Community Members Advocate for school health programs by speaking at community forums, writing letters to the editors of local newspapers, and updating organizations to which they belong Meet with school personnel to determine what support can be offered to advance the school's or district's health objectives Serve on a school-community committee for a CSHP or a particular component Infuse community-based school health services into the schools overall school health plan Provide mentoring and after-school programs to give children safe havens from violence and alternatives to drugs Provide school-to-work programs that lead to college, technical training, or good jobs after high school Provide programs for parents that include academic classes, literacy training, career preparation, early childhood education, childrens health, and assistance in finding helpful services in the community Offer summer learning programs through cultural institutions, parks and recreation, and other public and private agencies; activities might include programs at recreation centers, science and art museums, and libraries Identify appropriate funding sources or raise funds to support the school health program Nurture relationships between schools and community organizations that can provide young people with needed physical and mental health services Actions for State and National Organizations and Colleges and Universities Demonstrate commitment by developing infrastructures that support CSHPs, meeting with families and community groups to encourage their support, publicizing innovative models and exemplary programs, and encouraging organizational members and staff to become involved in their children's school health programs Adopt supportive position statements, policies, and standards Provide educational opportunities that help school personnel, family members, and others in the community work together more effectively Encourage more active family and community involvement by educating members and constituents about CSHPs; developing media campaigns; offering grants; collecting, assessing, and sharing resources that help practitioners network with peers in the community; compiling a directory of consultants experienced in working with young people; or sponsoring conferences and supporting publications to disseminate information about exemplary local, state, and national initiatives Adapted by permission of the publisher from Marx, E. & Wooley, S.

Reducing the Risks of Adolescent Substance Use Advances in research have helped us to identify and understand the risk factors that can contribute to the development of drug and alcohol problems in adolescents, as well as ways to reduce those risks. My research over the past 15 years has focused on developing more effective ways of integrating the assessment and treatment of addiction with the mental health, behavioral and family problems that are often linked to substance use in adolescents. It's important for parents to be alert to any significant changes or decline in the following areas: Change in school performance such as decline in grades, decreased motivation to complete assignments or involvement in school activities; skipping classes/truancy Significant changes in personal habits such as sleep (sleeping much more or much less), level of activity, appetite (increased or decreased), or hygiene Significant changes in behavior and/or mood such as increased irritability, aggression, decreased motivation, disregard for rules, mood swings, depression; expressing suicidal thoughts or behaviors Decreased involvement in positive social activities such as team sports or school related activities; loss of interest in a favorite hobby Association with a deviant peer group, gang involvement; legal problems A significant change in mood, behavior, academic performance, or peer group does not necessarily mean that your teenager is involved with drugs or alcohol.
All viewpoints focus on the linkages that exist between changes within a person over the course of his or her life and the changing structure and function of his or her family, peer group, school, workplace, and community setting, which in turn are embedded within policy, cultural, and historical contexts. Socialization in adolescence Whatever style parents use to rear their adolescents, the goal of parenting is to raise a child who is healthy and successful in life, who can contribute to self and to society, who accepts and works to further the social order. This influence may be associated with both positive and negative characteristics of adolescent behavior and development.
The fact that the mean scores on the CPRSR:L for children with FASD/trauma were in the clinically significant range in 8 of 14 behavioral categories strongly suggests that these extreme behaviors are actually typical for children with trauma/FASD. The impact of trauma on child development. A.
"Universal" prevention efforts help all people develop: strong attitudes that favor being safe and healthy; healthy life skills to solve problems, resist pressure, and relate with others in safe and positive ways; knowledge that will help them avoid problems with alcohol or other drugs Prevention includes a wide array of efforts that affect all of us throughout our communities: laws and other rules that discourage or control problems with alcohol and other drugs. Set an example of moderation or abstinence in your own use of drugs that are legal for adults. Changing Our "Alcohol and Other Drug Environment" - Close to Home Changes in the ways that alcohol and other drugs problems are viewed and treated in our communities can help to reduce the risks that people will develop these problems.
DEFINITION OF "FAMILY STRENGTHENING PROGRAMS" For the purposes of this review, a family strengthening program will be defined as any intervention that works with either a parent or caretaker of a child or some members of a family (including at least one target child) with the goal of reducing risk or increasing protective factors for problem behaviors. Family skills training programs have been evaluated rigorously by researchers and found to be effective in reducing a number of family, parent, and child risk factors for delinquency. The literature suggests that children with a large number of risk factors are those most in need of prevention interventions because of their increased risk for delinquency.
Effects of Childhood Behavior Problems on Parental Drinking As described in the previous section, in families with children with behavior disorders and/or parental alcoholism, both the parents and children appear to have an elevated risk for alcohol-related problems. Studies Involving Parents of ADHD Children To explore the link between alcohol problems and deviant child behavior in parents of children with ADHD, Pelham and colleagues (1998) employed the same study design with a sample of parents who had children with an externalizing disorder. As in the studies by Lang and colleagues (1989) and Pelham and colleagues (1997), parents of ADHD children responded with self-ratings of increased distress and negative affect after interactions with the deviant children.
It is important for you as a parent to know the facts about alcohol, warning signs of alcohol use, and ways to help your child if you discover that she is consuming alcohol. Changes in behavior such as loss of interest in activities or hobbies that once interested your child; lower energy levels; lying about friends and whereabouts; and withdrawal from family. Be supportive of your child, and let her know that you'll be there when she needs you.
According to Scott Counseling, some things that parents do that send confusing messages about drugs and alcohol include: *Not talking about tobacco and drugs *Misusing/abusing legal drugs, such as alcohol, in front of our children *Misusing/abusing prescription medication in front of our children *Watching and laughing at TV sitcoms that include adults misusing/abusing mood altering chemicals (1) Not talking to children about drugs is sometimes the most damaging thing a parent can do, because if a child doesn't get their ideas on drugs and alcohol from their parents, then the chances that they will get them from a public largely obsessed with recreational drug use and drinking are high. 800-706-9190 Perhaps the most common role that parents play in the addiction of their children is that of the enabler - a person who - consciously or not - makes the drug use of the addict possible. An enabler can be a parent who simply makes excuses for the drug use or drinking of their children, or they can be much more damaging.
Facts About Risk and Protective Factors for Teenager Alcohol and Other Drugs Abuse Studies indicate that children most often begin to use alcohol and other drugs at about age 12 or 13, and many researchers have observed young teens moving from the illicit use of legal substances (such as tobacco, alcohol, and inhalants) to the use of illegal drugs (marijuana is usually the first). The order of alcohol and other drug consumption in this progression is largely consistent with social attitudes and norms and the availability of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, helping children become more successful in school behavior and performance helps them form strong pro-social bonds with their peers, the school, and the community.
There are some parental characteristics that are more pervasive with severe child maltreatment than with less severe forms of child maltreatment. The services listed below are the most common services offered to caretakers with children entering longer-term foster care in Clackamas County. This random sample of cases is reviewed by trained researchers to determine the following family characteristics: the reasons children enter foster care, the level of vulnerability of children, severity of maltreatment, the problems of the parents, the problems of the children, barriers to returning children home, and the services offered to children and their families.
An alternative version of Active Parenting of Teens allowed teenagers as well as their parents to participate in the training, and was called Families in Action (Popkin and Hendrickson, 2000). Using the scores of 60 parents who completed an Active Parenting of Teens group, Mullis reported a significant positive change on the Parent Behaviors scale (reliability of .76) and positive, but non-significant, changes on the Parent Attitudes and Beliefs and Parent Observation of Child Behavior scales. Boccella (1998) reported that parents completing an Active Parenting group showed significantly more confidence in their parenting skills compared to a control group.
The aims of this study are to examine children's perceptions of protective (parental monitoring, family closeness) and risk factors (conflict, liberality of parental attitudes towards antisocial behaviours and family history of substance misuse) within their family environment, the extent to which these factors are associated with one another, and the associations of these risk and protective factors with children's self reported drinking behaviour. Frequencies of alcohol consumption behaviours amongst secondary school children Associations between independent variables As demonstrated in Table 4 , there was a high degree of interrelationship among the different components of family functioning, with 'protective factors' (i.e. family closeness, parental monitoring) positively correlated with one another, and negatively correlated with 'risk factors' (i.e. family conflict and violence, and liberality of attitudes towards alcohol/petty crime and substance use). While the CTC Youth Survey has previously been used in the UK to measure both young people's alcohol-related behaviours and pertinent risk and protective factors (such as the survey conducted in Plymouth, England) [ 50 ] the current study is the first to analyse the relationships between these aspects of the survey within a UK context.
Little is known about the role of men in paternity and parenting outside of marriage; thus, the results will provide basic information on how a man's background, experiences, and attitudes influence the timing and sequencing of marriage and paternity. Researchers are examining 1) the emotional and financial contributions of men to their children, 2) factors that inhibit or facilitate their involvement in parenting, 3) the male role in parenting children outside of marriage, and 4) racial differences in family formation behavior and parenting. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) funds numerous studies on the role of family in the development and prevention of alcohol disorders among children and adolescents.
This is something that you and your child can do together and the act will increase your child's sense of safety with you as well as in the world. It is OK for children to have "time off" from their grief experience, though this does not mean that the child has resolved all of his/her feelings about the death. This is a time when parents often need help outside of the family.
