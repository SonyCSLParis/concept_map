Schools require evidence of a child's special needs, including giftedness, in order to provide an appropriate school program. For parents of children who do not currently attend a CBE school often the services of a psychologist in private practice are required in order to determine, through assessment, whether their child meets the Alberta Education criteria to be considered a gifted learner. Students identified with gifted learning needs may seek access to a wide array of school programs within the CBE, including: Their designated CBE community or neighbourhood school CBE Alternative Programs Gifted and Talented Education Program (GATE) Your CBE Community or Neighbourhood School Many gifted learners attend their designated CBE community school where their exceptional learning needs are addressed through their Individual Program Plan (IPP).

Since young gifted children are often more advanced that their peers in a variety of ways, there is a legitimate concern that special adjustments needed to challenge young gifted children may not be readily available in the preschool or child care setting. The second area of difficulty with identification is related to the nature of the early childhood years and specifically the response of young children to the process of assessment and testing (Neisworth, 1993; Peterson, 1987). Young gifted children have advanced understanding and/or performance in a variety of areas which require the development of a challenging curriculum and appropriate educational interventions which are still sensitive to the developmental needs of these children.
Some conceptual definitions include a reference to a discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement, a concept and practice that is important for identifying many students with LD who are gifted, though the use of such a discrepancy for defining a learning disability has been criticized (cf. Teaching strategies and adaptive techniques Regardless of the program model utilized or the setting in which it is taught, the importance of gearing the curriculum to the strengths, rather than weaknesses, of academically talented students with learning disabilities, and of utilizing a variety of [ strategies, adaptations, and accommodations to help them succeed, is widely acknowledged (e.g., Baum et al.,1991; Fox, Tobin, & Schiffman, 1983; Hishinuma, 1991; Silverman, 1989; Suter & Wolf, 1987; Waldron, 1991).

23 Mar 16:53 By Carol Barnes Not a submission as yet but a preliminary queston: does anyone know if Qld has a section in its Education Act which is equivalent to, or similar to, s 20(e) of the NSW EDUCATION ACT 1990 : SECTION 20 Assistance to government school children with special needs (1) The Minister may provide or arrange special or additional assistance for government school children with special needs, such as: (a) children with disabilities, or (a1) children with significant learning difficulties, or (b) children who live in isolated or remote areas, or (c) children who are from non-English speaking backgrounds, or (d) Aboriginal children, or (e) children with special abilities, or (f) children who are disadvantaged by their socio-economic background. So as a first step, there does need to be recognition in the curriculum of the needs of gifted children, and lots of opportunites to cater for this. Being new to all this, I am sure there are many other burning issues that I haven't covered, but I think it's great that this is being discussed and that the QATGC is participating in these discussions.

They occur so rarely, it is often not recognised how radically different their education must be from that of their age peers, or from that of most other gifted children. But there is little or no differentiation between levels of giftedness within this group of children; and no recognition of the real differences which exist between children who are moderately or highly gifted and those who are exceptionally or even profoundly gifted. They will: - measure the child's ability with an individual IQ test, - assess their academic achievement, to identify what stage they have reached in important subjects, Achievement testing will show where the child needs to be placed academically; and ability testing how fast the child is likely to progress, and how radical their needs are likely to be (see further on this in Identification ).
Gifted children need a special environment, as does any special needs child, and it's important for parents to understand what to look for in a school, whether it's private or public. Any child could participate in fun activities, but a gifted program should be one that is designed specifically for gifted children. A school needs to be flexible enough to consider options for that child's math instruction.

Digest of Gifted Research Advocating and Partnering for Students with Special Needs Anyone involved in the education of a child who needs special accommodations or services for a learning difficulty or disability should read the Special Needs Advocacy Resource Book , by Rich Weinfeld and Michelle Davis, Prufrock , 2008. Even though parents may be advocates for their children, the authors emphasize that the services of a professional advocate are necessary because of the special knowledge and experience they have, including: knowledge of the definitions of disabilities, how special needs are evaluated, and how they are legally determined; familiarity with federal and state statutes, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) and No Child Left Behind (NCLB), as well as case law; ability to gather and interpret information objectively from various sources and through direct observation; skill in providing accurate and thorough documentation; knowledge about appropriate curriculum, accommodations, and services that can be provided; a network of educational, legal, and behavioral practitioners, etc. Although gifted children are not mentioned much, this book would be quite helpful for students with special needs in addition to their giftedness.

Approximately 20% of school-age children were born outside the United States or are children of immigrants (Capps, Fix, Ost, Reardon-Anderson, & Passel, 2004; Hernandez & Charney, 1998), many originating from Latin America or Asia (Pong, 2003). Other areas worth mentioning as problematic include assessment and the placement of minority schoolchildren in special education programs such as programs for children with learning disabilities, for children who are talented and gifted, and for children identified as having behavioral difficulties.

Exceptionally able students are not a homogeneous group, and often their identification can pose a problem for teachers." The Act is useful in that it defines certain key terms such as: "special educational needs" means the educational needs of students who have a disability and the educational needs of exceptionally able students" {Part 1 Section 2} However, when the EPSEN Act - The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 was drawn up the "exceptionally able" where omitted from the bill, leaving this group of children in a legal limbo.

On the one hand I believe that every child is a special needs child , simply because they are all individuals, each with their own special needs. Many of those special needs they have in common with other children - for example the need to be truly loved, cared for and nurtured - while for others their special needs might be more individually specific to them. Without exception each and every child has their own way in which to receive and process information most effectively, and it is important that we as parents provide for our children a means by which both the child and the parent(s) can discover what that preferred learning style is for each child.
Special Needs Resources Thanks to a number of organizations, both local and national, that are committed to supporting families of children with special needs, the journey is a little less confusing for parents, leading to better outcomes for their children.
