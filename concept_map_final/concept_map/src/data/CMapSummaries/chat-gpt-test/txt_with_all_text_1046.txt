Research shows that, regardless of class, race, or educational background, all parents believe their children will benefit from their involvement with their children's schools (Marttila and Kiley Inc. 1995, Chavkin 1989). And, in fact, many teachers and other staff members have not learned how to communicate and work effectively with parents and families, particularly those who have different cultural, socioeconomic, or language backgrounds.

Most schools are already working very hard to involve parents, but the Act makes it a top priority for every education authority and every school to support the involvement of parents: at home   by providing them with information on what their children are learning at school and how this can best be supported at home through school   by providing them with opportunities to contribute to the life of the school e.g. by helping out in the classroom, on school trips and at school events in a more formal way   by helping them to decide what kind of parent group the school should have. The type of things a Parent Council could get involved in include: Supporting the work of the school Gathering and representing parents' views to the Head Teacher, education authority and HMIE Promoting contact between the school, parents, pupils, providers of nursery education and the local community Main features of Parent Councils Only parents of children at that school can be members of the Parent Council The Parent Forum can agree that the Parent Council constitution allows other people to be co-opted The local church or denominational body can nominate someone to be co-opted onto the Parent Council of a denominational school The Parent Council chair must be a parent of a child at that school The Head Teacher or their representative has a right and a duty to attend Parent Council meetings, unless the parents and Head Teacher decide otherwise Schools can choose to set up a Combined Parent Council which would cover more than one school. Every school's Parent Council will be different because it will be parents in each school who decide such things as: how their Council will be set up what it should be called what size it should be   e.g. in a very small primary school, all parents could be involved who should be a member of the Parent Council how they should be appointed when the most convenient time is to hold meetings what will be discussed at meetings   these might be topics such as school uniform, parking near the school, the school's anti-bullying policy, etc.
