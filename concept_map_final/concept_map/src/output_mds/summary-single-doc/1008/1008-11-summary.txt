Ways you can help your children When you begin to accept the separation then your children will be able to do the same - it is important that you get on with your life and not dwell in the past or hang on to any anger or bitterness. An important point to remember is that most children love both parents and although they may have many feelings about the separation, in most cases they miss their parents and want to keep in contact with them. Children should be able to feel that both parents are positive about their time with the other parent.
