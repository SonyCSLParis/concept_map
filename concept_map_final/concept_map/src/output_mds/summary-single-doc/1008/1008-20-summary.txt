Cummings, the Notre Dame Professor of Psychology, and researchers from Rochester University and the Catholic University of America, found that the manner in which parents handle everyday marital conflicts has a significant effect on how secure their children feel, and, in turn, significantly affects their future emotional adjustment. "A useful analogy is to think about emotional security as a bridge between the child and the world," Cummings said. The researchers again found that destructive marital conflict led to similar problems.
