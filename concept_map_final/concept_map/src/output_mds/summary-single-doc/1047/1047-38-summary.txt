On the one hand I believe that every child is a special needs child , simply because they are all individuals, each with their own special needs. Many of those special needs they have in common with other children - for example the need to be truly loved, cared for and nurtured - while for others their special needs might be more individually specific to them. Without exception each and every child has their own way in which to receive and process information most effectively, and it is important that we as parents provide for our children a means by which both the child and the parent(s) can discover what that preferred learning style is for each child.
