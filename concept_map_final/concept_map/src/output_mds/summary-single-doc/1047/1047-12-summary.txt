They occur so rarely, it is often not recognised how radically different their education must be from that of their age peers, or from that of most other gifted children. But there is little or no differentiation between levels of giftedness within this group of children; and no recognition of the real differences which exist between children who are moderately or highly gifted and those who are exceptionally or even profoundly gifted. They will: - measure the child's ability with an individual IQ test, - assess their academic achievement, to identify what stage they have reached in important subjects, Achievement testing will show where the child needs to be placed academically; and ability testing how fast the child is likely to progress, and how radical their needs are likely to be (see further on this in Identification ).
