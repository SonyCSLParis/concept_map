One of the hardest things for a child to learn is how to stand up for what's right, even in the face of possible scrutiny or embarassment. Make it clear to your child that you take bullying seriously and that you will not tolerate this behavior. The Children's Library also offers some great books for both children and parents on the subject of bullying.
