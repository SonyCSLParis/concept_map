It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that corporal punishment should be legally prohibited in all states and that alternative forms of student behavior management e utilized in the school setting. Historically corporal punishment has been used to discipline school students although physical punishment is currently prohibited in public schools in 29 states, including many school districts in many major American cities (Gershoff, 2008; National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools [NCACPS], 2008; United State Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2009).The American Academy of Pediatrics (2006), the National Parent Teacher Association (2010), the National Association of School Psychologists (2006), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2007) are among groups that have taken a position recommending the abolishment of corporal punishment. Corporal punishment adversely affects students' self-image and school achievement, can contribute to disruptive behaviors, can result in physical harm, inhibits the development of appropriate social skills, and also promotes the message that violence is an acceptable mode of behavior in our schools (National Association of School Psychologists [NASP], 2006).
