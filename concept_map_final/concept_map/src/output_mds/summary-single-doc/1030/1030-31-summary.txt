A school can make reasonable rules for the good order of the school and the discipline of students. Good discipline in a school is required to ensure that schools are able to provide quality education for all students and to guarantee the care and safety of the school community. But if you are out of class for a longer period, for example for more than one school period, you should be supervised and given school work to do.
