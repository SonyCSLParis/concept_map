Prior to coming to PRC in June 0f 2002, a five year study was undertaken to explore the relationships between maternal behaviors (specifically alcohol use, punitive and protective behaviors) and adolescents' symptoms of trauma and their alcohol use. Thus all of mothers' behaviors were related to each other. To explore further how maternal behavior may be related to other patterns of adolescent alcohol and drug use, we then explored whether maternal alcohol involvement was related to children's expectancies about alcohol use.
